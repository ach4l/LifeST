{"comment_0": "\nSuch a fantastic song, one of my favorites.  A Brian May composition which is a bit of a departure from the power progressive style of Queen.  It's a science fiction tale which brilliantly employs a part of Einsteins theory of Relativity, time dilation.  Meaning as speed increases time expands; a week becomes a month, a month becomes a year, etc.   It tells a story of a group of space voyagers (the volunteers), who in the year of 39 (could be 2239, 2339, who knows) depart a dying Earth in a space ship to explore a distant world for habitability. Presumably a government project, essentially scouting the planet for colonization.  If they were to travel at speeds approaching the speed of light then the effects of time dilation would dramatically reduce the rate at which they age.  A year back on Earth could mean only a day to them physiologically.  If you follow the words you can piece together it took the volunteers 100 years to complete the mission, returning to Earth exactly one century later (in the year of 39 came a ship in from the blue).  It's the year of 39.... in the next century. \n\r\nUpon their return they discover the world they left no longer exists.  They have been gone a century yet the effects of time dilation has aged them only a year. Their families are long dead, the Earth has deteriorated to a gray planet.  They came back to report the world they explored is vibrant and perfect for humanity.  But their good news is quickly squashed by the realization that they are now refugees in time.  \n\r\nThe song seems to have a dual narrative; a third person perspective telling the tale of the voyage and their return underlying a first person conversation.  \"Can't you hear me calling you, though you're many years away?\" is an imaginary conversation between one of the volunteers and presumably his wife, speaking to her through space and time.  \"write your letters in the sand\", to me, seems to suggest leaving him a message etched in the earth he will see when he returns, perhaps a tree or stone.  \"for the day I take your hand in the land that our grandchildren knew.\" is simply a longing to return to the time and place with his loved ones.  A land he knows his grandchildren will inhabit in his absence.  \n\r\nI think the line \"your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me.\"  suggest the voyager has met one of his children.  After so long it has to be assumed his child is now a centenarian.  And he is still a young man.  \n\r\n\"For my life's still ahead, pity me.\"  means he is now alone and will live out the rest of his life displaced in time with no one.   \n\r\nLyrically the song does not give you all the information you would need to assemble the events or meaning of those events.  It only gives you enough to put together a long voyage and it's effects physically and psychologically.  What I love is the way it's intentionally framed as a sea voyage to a new land, not as a journey into space. Unless you knew \"though I'm older but a year\" meant a very specific phenomena of intergalactic travel, you would be confused by that.  But that is precisely what it is, and Mays knew enough about astrophysics to use it as the basis for a sad tale of loss.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI agree with brian May - its about space travel.\n\r\nhe should know - he wrote it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nWithout doubt the lyrics deal with Special relativity and time dilation.

Do you really think that time passes more slowly for sailors when they're far from land?\n\r\nOr for astronauts when they're far from earth?\n\r\n***Here's the science behind this for all you people*** (and this is some mind blowing crap, if you can really get it):\n\r\nThe speed of any thing in the universe, including people, *through the 4 dimensions, i.e. the three spatial dimensions and the time dimension*, is equal to the speed of light.\n\r\nThus, as one's speed through the three spatial dimensions increases, one's speed through time has to slow -- because one's speed through all 4 dimensions (3 space + 1 time dimension) is always equal to the speed of light.\n\r\nThus, if one was to travel through the 3 spatial dimensions at the speed of light, one's speed through the 1 time dimension is equal to 0. That is, if one is traveling at the speed of light through space, your speed through time is reduced to 0.\n\r\nEven if you do not reach the speed of light, as you accelerate through the 3 spatial dimensions (i.e. MOVE!), your speed through time slows. \n\r\nThus, even if you get up from your computer and walk across the room, your speed through time has slowed down. More time would have passed for a friend who sat still than had passed for you while you walked across the room. The effect is just very tiny for low speeds.\n\r\nIt can, however, be detected by very precise timepieces even for long flights. (I.e., you take two identical, synchronized, very precise timepieces, and you take one on a 24 flight, and the other is left stationary on the ground. The one that is on the ground will show more time has elapsed than the one that you flew with, i.e. while moving time passed more slowly for you!)\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with how far away from earth or from land (were you kidding about that?). Have you ever known a sailor who came back from a boat trip one hundred years older??!?\n\r\nAnyhow, the main point is that your speed through space-time (i.e. the 3 spatial dimensions plus the 1 time dimension) is equal to the speed of light, thus as you increase your speed through the 3 spatial dimensions, your speed through the 1 time dimension must be reduced, because your speed through all 4 dimensions is constant, i.e. it is always equal to the speed of light. (Don't ask me how we know that you speed through time is equal to the speed of light when you're sitting still. This is Einstein stuff, literally, I think.)\n\r\nI do admit that your dad, insanity_defined, may have been onto something with the distance from earth thing -- but not the distance from land. I say this because I have heard that further from earth, where gravity is weaker, time passes slower or faster. (It's got to be slower, right? I think so.) I think this effect (the gravity/distance from earth effect) is too weak to ever cause the kinds of differences in the experience of time that are cited in the song, though, so this clearly isn't the explanation.\n\r\nBut the effect the song is clearly speaking about is the one that occurs when you travel very fast. \n\r\nAnd, on a separate note, **all of you who are pretending that the song isn't about space travel are silly**. If you believe that May said that it's about space travel, how can you say otherwise? (If you don't believe that he said that, that's a different matter. But no one seems to be saying that. You seem to be claiming that the meaning of the song, as stated by the author, is somehow not the meaning of the song.) \n\r\nFor God's sake -- a songmeaning(s.net) is what the author says the song means!!! Sure, you can have your personal meanings. But don't come on here saying \"it seems unlikely this is about space travel.\" It *is* about space travel. That's what the author said! (If you contest that he said that, fine, but otherwise there's nothing to say other than that you're silly!)\n\r\nIf you want to offer your personal meaning, call that \"your *personal* meaning\", and if you want to offer an explanation you've heard from someone other than the songwriter, call it a \"potential meaning\" or \"meaning you've heard\"  -- as separate from \"*the* meaning\", which refers to the \"the meaning intended by the author, as reliably documented\".\n\r\n\"*The* meaning\" is what the author says it is. And the author says it's about space travel.\n\r\nSo, now we've put that to rest, and you've all got a science lesson. ;)\n\r\nAnd this is a very sweet, very atmospheric song which I'd never really given such a listen to. Very cool. Doesn't the background high pitched voices, like the ones it starts with, evoke space travel? It sounds 50's sci-fi-ish to me...\n\r\nVery beautiful, and the only really non-corny, truly sci-fi song I can think of. (Space Oddity isn't really very sci-fi, more like sci.)

However people's other associations are still relevant.  The song is written in the style of an older folksong, and (quite deliberately I think) if you don't listen carefully/don't understand about relativity it sounds like a song about earlier voyages.  While to me the reference has always been to earlier voyages of exploration, the experience of people going to war would also work.  It draws parallels between the experience of space travellers and those earlier voyagers: going into the unknown, leaving behind loved ones, perhaps for many years, being out of contact, coming back to find life has moved on and things have changed, eg the love of your life may have married someone else.  So the song is not just a literal story of space travel, but also about feelings experienced by voyagers past and future.\n\nThe use of a folksy style also underlines the time that passes in the song.  By the time the space travellers return the day they set out is ancient history: a brave tail to be told in an old song.  The rousing tale of their daring voyage is contrasted with the reality of their loss when they return.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_77": "\nI know this is isn't the true meaning of the lyrics, but hum it to myself while doing genealogy research.

I don't think its about space travel or relativity; May, IMO, is using that to illustrate his point.\n\r\nThis is about a long journey that returns to its point of origin many years later. I see it as a conversation between a child and an adult (parent?) who wonders why he cannot seem to make the adult understand (don't you hear my call though your many years away?) After taking the arduous journey, the child, now an adult, finds himself in the same conversation, but now on the other side and still unable to bridge the gap of years.\n\r\nThe journey is the jouney of life. I think he uses \"lands\" as a metaphor for knowledge & experience. And while he certainly points out man's impermanence, there are still universal things such as the inadequacy of language to convey experience and true wisdom. And in the end \"all your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand\" which says to me that there are more profound ways of sharing oneself with others than mere words.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
