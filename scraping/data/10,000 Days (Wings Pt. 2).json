{"comment_0": "\nFirst, people really need to listen to TOOL, APC, and Puscifer and realize that Maynard Keenan, although very spiritual, is not a fan of organized religion.\nThe 10,000 Days album is not about religion, but a variety of topics, such as vicarious being about vicariously living out violence through TV (eye on the TV...cause I need to watch things die from a distance), The Pot being about hypocrisy (every line in the song pretty much being an analogy for hypocrisy), and Rosetta Stoned being an overdose from  X and DMT (10 to 2 AM, X and yogi DMT and a box of krispy kremes).\nThe song Wings for Marie, and 10,000 Days (Wings pt. 2), these very beautiful and powerful songs, are about Maynard Keenan's mother, Judith Marie, who suffered from a stroke that left her paralyzed and wheelchair bound until she died 27 years later, which is about 10,000 days, rounding up. He also makes a specialty wine named after his mother.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nListen to the tales as we all rationalize\r\nOur way into the arms of the savior,\r\nFeigning all the trials and the tribulations;\r\nNone of us have actually been there.\r\nNot like you.\n\r\nMany people spend their life rationalizing, trying to make a logical decision of what to believe in. Maynard respects his mother for going by her true feelings, or intuition, instead. people try to convince themselves to keep faith or believe in this or that. she actually experienced the \"light\" described by so many different schools of thought through her faith in Jesus. Even though maynard doesnt like the stories of jesus he cant help but respect and admire this \"light\". christianity isnt the only way to achieve it, probably the least likely way actually. all the more reason to respect his mother for it.\n\r\nThis is what maynard learned from his mother. to seek that light and live for it. he just chooses to seek it in a different way... \"a gift you passed on to me\"\n\r\nthe feeling most people only \"read about\"\n\r\nshe never lived a lie, she actually felt this spiritual connection to jesus. her set of beliefs says that in doing this she will be saved, go to heaven or whatever. thats why maynard says she can look god in the eye and demand her wings. Its an assurance that she did her part.\n\r\nshe saved maynards life by teaching him to trust his spirituality.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI'm a 16 year old guy, and a huge fan of TOOL.\n\r\nI just want to say that this song has the most powerful lyrics of any song by TOOL. Hell, it has the most powerful lyrics of any song by anyone. In all honesty, after reading the lyrics along with the music, I was crying. Like actually crying. Don't get me wrong, but I've never been religious. But religious or not, this song truly sums up life and death. This is a beautiful tribute to his mother that delves into the unknown deeper than anything ever before. Producing a poetic masterpiece like this is an achievement no one should ignore. The time, the effort, the emotion that goes into creating something like this: it all just adds up to song that is nothing short of monumental.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\n@drds63 - I think you may have taken the lyrics a bit too literally, from lyrics from this song and other it would seem Maynard is probably an agnostic if not an atheist outright (Set in my ways and my arrogance, burden of proof tossed on believers).  What I think hes saying, interpreted from that perspective, is that he hopes his mother is rewarded for her lifetime of hardship, belief, and faith, that if anyone is deserving of a reward it is her.\n\r\nYou're definitely right that he is holding her high on a perch, but come on it's his mom.  In other songs hes seemed to allude to her saving him (Reflection: \"I have come curiously close to the end\" \"Within my darkest moment, feeling weak\" \"As full and bright as I am, this light is not my own, A million light reflections, pass over me\") so she probably was very special to him, and this is his send off to her.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nHaha...all the people that posted back in 06 thought this was a fake. Nope. \r\nAnyways this song is obviously written to Judith Marie, Maynard's mom. She was paralyzed for 27 years, or 10,000 days, but you already know all that.\r\nThis song serves two purposes: 1. As a eulogy to his mother and 2. as a way to call attention to the hypocrisy within the christian church. Judith was heavily religious and dedicated her life to God despite her being paralyzed. Maynard calls her a savior in herself because she is the only one, it seems, in the christian faith to follow the teachings so devotedly. He also says that the rest of the \"ingorant sinners\" are lost without her. The song also includes an account of what it would be like as Judith approaches the gates of ST.

The lyrics don't have to be the biggest point of Tool songs, especially if they're from Maynard's viewpoint of things.

Maynard has known religion.\r\n(That reminds me, I hope Zack doesn't find this lyric)\n\r\nThis is a tribute drenched in LOVE to both her and the emotions, and thoughts he has had concerning her and the universe around her.\n\r\nAnd if the anti-this, anti-that, fans that don't see higher meaning think that this album and the \"new\"(bs) direction tool is heading is a dissapointment, all I can say is FINALLY! Get of the fucking bus and return your fucking tickets.\n\n\r\nI try to keep the things I believe in to a minimum, so that I can better experience... that being said, that leaves me the room to consider the possibilities... I personally haven't succomed to organized religion, but I have considered his mother's fundemental envangelicalist way of thinking.\r\n I have to believe I would think the same, given a person I loved and watched go through hell-on-earth. Even if I thought that her faith was too caught up in the details, distractions, and corruptions of some written words.\r\n \"In the beginning there was love, after that you pretty close the book.\"\n\n\r\nLook him in the eye\r\nLook him in the eye and tell him..\r\n\"I never lived a lie, never took a life,\r\nBut surely saved one\r\nHallejullah,\r\nIt's time for you to bring me home\"\r\n-kind of shows him looking through her eyes.\n\n\r\nLove can drive us to view through others eyes. From my humble impression of Maynard (I stress, I don't presume to know and understand him, or anyone) I believe him to be the type that understand this and probably had no reservations about letting out this journey of the mind, its great therapy.\r\nShe beleived so strong, he has criticized her, but he also loves her. I for one feel a little like I know the subject of the song, he describes her so clearly.\n\r\nMaybe he found the light...Maybe he's just patronizing her, but this isn't an angry sarcastic song so I doubt it.\n\r\nWhat an intimate human he is he shows us all again. Would you share your pain with the entire world?\n\r\nI said a lot but I don't think I said anything meaningful, I don't even think I got my point across. Someone will probably show up and say what I'm trying to say, in 4 words.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_57": "\nWhat gets me the most is not the lyrics.

Since she has worked so hard, the universe after death should be malleable to what she expected, and thus she should be able to receive what the bible and her faith promised her in reward for her kindness and faith.\"\n\n\n\r\nExcellent summation of the song, Oni. This is exactly what it is about. 10,000 Days is the best song on the album in my personal opinion. The music is cohesive and heart-felt....spiritually and synergistically transcendant of sum of its parts. The most amazing part of the song is how Maynard finally comes to terms and accepts that it is okay that he doesn't believe HOW his mother believed. It doesn't make her any less worthy of what she deserves than he of what he deserves. And she was a pillar of strength, faith, and inspiration for him and many others it seems. It is very touching because he concedes she must have been must stronger than he in her faith, and it seems he is actually envious of her. In a certain way, he elevates her strength in faith above his own and demands for her what everyone knows she deserves--a place of rest and peace in eternity (what she envisioned as becoming an angel in heaven through her own belief--getting her wings). He let's go of his cynical viewpoint of her faith and realizes it was her source of strength and positive energy that had helped her to fight and hold on for those 10,000 days. And for all that fighting, he voices for her some of the most beautiful, powerful, and moving lyrics I have ever heard:\n\r\n\"It's time now!\r\nMy time now!\r\nGive me my, give me my wings!\"\n\r\nI started crying after I heard that...I realized I've been doing the same thing to my mother for some time now--writing off her beliefs and her advice and thinking that she's being naive for holding on to them. What I thought was being sheepish and simple-minded was really just being human and hopeful. It made me realize I should feel ashamed for how I act and that there is strength with my mother for how she can tolerate mine and everyone else's cynacism and criticism. Bless her and all the other mothers out there.\n\r\nFrom this, I gather it's not what we believe that makes us worthy of eternity--it's how good we are to each other and to this world. It's the positive energy that radiates from our being that should determine our fate. We should be given what we deserve. And at the very least, we should recognize those who deserve what they believe in.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_61": "\nI love this song, it reminds me off the begining of push-it on salival.

Pity though, as high and mighty as Christians like to be percieved (and I'm pointing a finger at myself here), they tend to forget that ALL should be loved.

One of his examples of evidence of the missing element is the peculiar \"four cornered\" priests' hat that has three \"mickey mouse \"ears not four , as the design of the hat should dictate.\r\nSuffice it to say that the lines \"fetch me the spirit, the son and the father...etc\" could have been lifted straight from Jung's writings.

Unlike alot of other Tool songs, I can say with 100% assurance that I know what i'm talking about! That this is about Judith's devotion to God, and as eskimo_8 mentioned, Maynard is quite disgusted with her god, but is both respectful and inspired by her. She prayed and kept the faith without fault, and recieved nothing in return. MJK seems truly inspired by her relentless faith in these lyrics. After all this spite towards God though, I think, and I may well be wrong, that MJK is saying that she is going home (to heaven) and that all the faith has finally paid off; that she has done her time, so to speek. That's basically my interpretation of the song, and how he feels about her mother's faith. This is mainly about how his mother feels towards God, but on the song, \"Judith\" by A perfect circle, the lyrics are based around how Maynard feels about his mother's faith in God.\n\r\n- Please take the time to read this if and tell me if i'm right or wrong.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_101": "\nyes, hawk_er_8, eskimo_8, and thirdeyewide, I feel the same way about this song.\n\r\nI do have a question, though...

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to the realization there are many Tool fans that are missing so much depth, lyrically and instrumentally. To simply dismiss Maynard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s poetic ingenuity with comments like \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaynard has had a beef with God for some time now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d is quite elementary. When Maynard says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFuck your God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not literally stating to God, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFuck You.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Instead, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s using \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour God\u00e2\u0080\u009d to symbolize his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perception of \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that is, a man-made institution which has much more in common with business than spirituality. To understand this song, one must go back to Opiate. The title of this album is derived from a famous line stated by both Marx and Engel, \u00e2\u0080\u009cReligion is the Opiate of the masses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-explanatory\u00e2\u0080\u00a6at least I hope. So, with that said, one can easily understand how Maynard believes organized religion is a tool used for one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own personal gain and to distract and control the masses, that is, you. Now this much should be evident, but from the posts I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly not. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a quote directly from Maynard: \n\r\n\"My views against Christianity or religion in general are directed towards the 'middle men'-those who are in power and use religion as a market force by which to manipulate human beings for their own personal gain. The middle men taint any purity of spirituality that could result from genuine religious/mystical experiences\". \u00e2\u0080\u0093Maynard James Keenan\n\r\nNow, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s analyze \u00e2\u0080\u009c10,000 Days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In this song, Judith Marie embodies a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPillar of Faith.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is such a powerful image to take in that I fear its meaning was lost to many. Judith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faith in this man-made institution was so strong, that it stood in its own right. Amongst these hypocrites, merely claiming religion for its social acceptability, there stood Judith. Physically disabled for \u00e2\u0080\u009c10,000 Days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d her faith acted as a witness to Maynard of spirituality so pure amidst a charade of an establishment. Let me reinforce Maynard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quote: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6The middle men taint any purity of spirituality that could result from genuine religious/mystical experiences.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the surface.

I think that's pretty interesting that the song is partly about his mother, but I don't think that's the most important message here. I think he references that to say, \"okay here's what I learned from her, and now...this is what I make of it in relation to the world\" \n\r\nTo me, this song takes the christian belief that they are to be saved from hell on earth one day while the rest of us remain here to suffer. And the song cleverly shows this view for what is really is... preposterous. When maynard says \"you're the only one who can hold your head up high, wave your fists at the gate sayin, 'I have come home now!'\" he doesn't mean it literally he's just showing that that's what these people actually believe but the truth is non-religious people can be just as-if not MORE enlightened than relligious. (Religion means you have a set system of beliefs with strict rules and guidelines) so don't mistake sprirituality with religion there is a difference. And for all those people who call themselves a religious name like christian or catholic, yet they don't actually follow the guidelines accordingly...Guess what? You're not christian or catholic so stop saying you are. I believe in reincarnation but I don't go around saying I'm a buddhist. Cause many of the details surrounding my beliefs are very different than buddhism. \n\r\nAnyway sorry for goin off on a tangent there, back to the song...\"burden of proof tossed upon non-believers\" I think this refers to how religioun can't prove anything it preeches and nor can non-religious people dis-prove it. Therefor the actual state of world should be left simply to what is more logical, and we should accept and admit the things we don't know and move on. Suggesting theories is all well and fine as long as we acknowledge that they are just that. Theories.

Seems to me maynard is waiting for the end of the world and preparing.  I've even heard the floor in his room is raised into a dome so when the water comes in LA his bed will be lifted off.  IDK though...could all be bullshit. Tools following is quite filled with drug addict paranoid schizo's.  Its  agood album but far from aenima and lateralus....and me being the metal head I am I still like opiate and undertow the best.  OPiate is what got me into playing and listening to music. It had balls and gumption.  Maynard doesn't have as much volume in his voice as he once had.  It happens when singers get older. He seems to rely more on effects and layering too.

I guess it's not enough that lateralus debuted at number one, i guess it's not enough they sell a shit load of t-shirts at hot topic, i also assume it wasnt enough that they won 2 grammys. i assume these werent enough because i have to pay 60-100some dollars to see them play some of their gay newshit, with some of their good stuff mixed in. that price is not including gas, because they (of course) didnt play a show anywhere near me. well i guess that's alright because i could always go download some of their shows they've taped, that sounds like a cool idea, maybe i'll get salival. whoops, that box set cost close to 80 dollars. ok then maybe i'll try finding a bootleg, or some mp3 recordings of their live shows, whoops, i can't find any, because it seems that tool probably doesnt allow people to record their shows. If you don't get the point I'm making, then i guess i have to spell it out for you, TOOL IS A COMMERCIAL BAND! You may not see them on mtv (anymore) but trust me, they're as commercial as the red hot chilli peppers, if not more.\n\r\n\"keep enjoying the hard shit and maybe when your'e older you'll join the rest of us.\"\n\r\nso I'm immature, because i don't like Tool's newest piece of ambient/emo/art shit heap they've put out. that's a load of bullshit. So if i'm immature for liking tool back when they weren't artsy, then thats fine with me, at least i have taste. if you can stand to listen to ambient noises and a few dissonant notes played here and there, with some expensive bongos played in the background, while some asshole moans about his dead mother and other stupid shit, then you have bad taste in music. listening to tools new albums doesnt make you smart, it doesnt make you a world renowned music critic, it makes you a know-it-all music dick. like those assholes who work at the indie-record store. stop giving tool money for making shitty albums this instant, and maybe they will make an album with the majority of the songs being under 6:30, or adding in some stupid chanting, and maybe, just maybe they'll make cool music again... wouldnt that be great?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_194": "\nNo, you're immature because your bitching about how some people like their new stuff, while some people, yourself included, enjoy Tool's earlier stuff.

People buy the shirt because they like the band. And in doing so allows them to have more money to create more music. Tool is commercial, but isn't every band.

I'm aware that there are many Tool fans who dig Aenima and Lateralus, but don't care too much for Undertow as a whole.  This is understandable as those three albums are decidedly distinct and different from each other.\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is, Undertow, Aenima and Lateralus have come and gone.  They are all ground that has been traversed and navigated, and when those explorations were completed, Tool moved on to new things and never went back.  Can you not at least respect them for constantly moving forward, regardless of how you estimate their work?\n\r\nIt is true that Tool's latest album has polarized and divided their fanbase, but it was bound to happen sometime.  Let's pretend they played it safe and stuck with what they knew, eventually people would start bitching that all their shit sounds the same.  When Tool or any other band releases an album unlike its predecessors, especially something unexpected, based on their style, there ARE going to be those that dislike it and become disillusioned with the band.\n\r\nYes, Tool is a commercial band; they are a product of American society, as are we all(those in America, that is).  They know how to make money and they do it, but on top of that they apply themselves to their work.  Those fucks in the indie scene who are so self-deluded that they eschew all media backing and think they can rely on \"word-of-mouth\" to proliferate, after a while wonder why the fuck they're still starving in obscurity, it's because their shit sucks, but they can't realize it.  But then when these same shitty bands go the way of the major label, they have a clear desire to earn money and we, the public, get the All American Rejects and their talentless ilk. *shudder* Shit sells, as MTV and the billboard charts can attest.\n\r\nBack on topic, Tool is a talented band that desires to make money.  Yet they continue to take risks with their music.  In the end, they know their position is secure enough to take those risks and still rake in assloads of money.  Personally, I enjoy each Tool album objectively.  Everyone has the right to disagree, but to impugn others for their tastes is pointless and stupid.  Like FoE said, you're not going to alter anyone's position.  And about the shirt thing, sure you're wearing an insult on your chest, but so many people are aware of the band nowadays that nobody really cares, and those that do are just elitist asswipes.\r\nPeople who love a band are going to wear the band's shirts, bottom line. Rebuking them for that reason is also pointless and stupid.\n\r\nWhew, I'm done for now\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_196": "\nGood comeback puddintime. I obviously misjudged  you. This is where I stand:\r\nLateralus was the album that made me a Tool fan. When Tool released Aenema, they reached their creative peak so the question was; Where do they go from here? This is why Lateralus and Ten Thousand Days are so different from the rest of their stuff. They wanted to do something different, something experimental, which obviously alienated alot of OGTs. This doesn't mean their new stuff is 'gay' it's just different. That being said, people aren't idiots for liking their new stuff, they just prefer artsy shit to the convential band structure. It's not fair to expect Tool to play easily digestible music in 4/4 & 3/4 again for the sake of being 'cool'. Tool don't care about being popular. They make the make the music that they want to make, not what people want them to make and I wouldn't have it any other way.\r\nAnyway, I know what you're saying now puddintime, I just don't understand why you're so pissed off about it?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_197": "\nI really like you guys..

I remember listening to Melvins, Butthole Surfers, Primus, Fugazi, Minor Threat, Black Flag, Helmet, Husker Du, Minutemen, etc, when i was less than 8 fucking years old. Those bands NEVER compromised their sound. Plus they played ANYWHERE THEY COULD, FUCKING ANYWHERE. That's what pisses me off the most about Tool. Back in the early 90's they were just like all those great underground bands, in the sense that they had an uncompromising sound, they wouldn't change for anyone or anything. They would play the same \"small\" venues, and play wherever they could, and then.....they changed, a lot. It just seems that ever since AEnima hit it \"big\" they've given up their connection to that underground, hard rock scene, for something pompous and overly arty. They used to be one of those really original bands, every album was different, but still connected by the overall sound. But now, Lateralus and 10,000 days sound almost exactly alike to me, and I for one just can't wrap my head around it. why did they give up rock for ambient noises. I, for one, can't understand why they gave up on their older fans, and started playing slower and longer, and in bigger venues in like 20 out of the 50 states. I also can't understand why they charge so much for tickets, or why they play so many shows in Europe, Japan, and Australia.

I'm actually glad you brought this up because it's the same sentiment of many disgruntled OGTs. Anyway...\r\n  \"It just seems that ever since AEnima hit it 'big' they've given up their connection to that underground, hard rock scene, for something pompous and overly arty.\"\r\n  I agree that Lateralus and TTD are a paradigm shift from Aenima howvever seeing as Aenima was as big as it was, there was no way Tool COULD go back to the underground scene. I may be wrong on this, but Tool never considered themselves part of the 90s grunge movement. In other words, they never made a commitment to stay underground. MJK said it himself:\r\n \"I sold out long before you never even heard my name, I sold my soul to make a record ...etc\"\r\n  \"Why did they give up rock for ambient noises?\"\r\nThey may have given up rock in the traditional sense but there new stuff isn't all ambience. Most of it is complex time signatures and polyrythyms. As for the ambience, maybe Tool in their old age got all that anger out of them and mellowed out. Maybe they took too many drugs and couldn't go back to the days of Undertow and Aenima. I agree that LTRS and TTD are unrelated to the sound of Undertow and Aenima, but their music is still their own. Tool wouldn't change for anyone or anything, except themselves.\r\nI can understand your beef now puddintime. I myself was a child of the 90s, but the 90s are over and times have changed, and Tool changed with them. (Besides, if they didn't play in Australia I'd never get a chance to see them) very few 90s bands survived the turn of the millenium. Even if those that did changed their style dramatically, I for one am glad they are still around today. Anyway, the underground scene is still alive today in the... well, underground. There are many indie bands that have been inspired by, and continue the legacy of the 90s scene. Even if these bands make it big someday, let us hope they don't sell out.\r\n  Peace.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_204": "\nI wish everyone would just stop arguing about stuff that is so irrelevent to the songs meaning.

She tried to show him why she believes the things she does, and through her death, achieved this.\n\r\nA post from Wikipedia, \"Yesterday, when I went to the studio to give Maynard a bottle of wine (a 1992 Maya) for winning the bet that I had with him involving his new film \u00e2\u0080\u009cSleeping Dogs Lie\u00e2\u0080\u009d (I lost by default, not being able to attend the Sedona screening), not only wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Maynard there, but, in what seems to be a case of enantiodromia (something becoming its opposite) if ever there was one (!), I was told the reason why he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there. I wish this post was dated April 1, but, unfortunately, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.

In fact, it just seemed like another MJK prank until I talked to the one person who I believe would know if all this was legit or not. After nearly an hour on the phone with this person, the answer I received was that Maynard has indeed \u00e2\u0080\u009cfound Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that, for this reason, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abandoned the project for the time being, if not entirely.

It is a coincidence that Maynard's mother's name was Marie, and that the mother of Jesus Christ was also named Mary (even though it is spelt differently). I feel that this was done strategically in the song, and Maynard considers himself to be a messiah (not a pretentious one), but a messiah in the sense that he is putting into words by way of lyrics and songs, emotions and feelings that we have all felt but have not been able to communicate properly for a long time. This song is about Maynard respecting Christianity eventhough he did not totally believe its teachings in the past, but I also feel that it could be a song about the relationship between Jesus Christ and his mother (The Virgin Mary), because it emphasizes on her devotion to the religion of Judaism (Without you to guide them all to Zion), and about how she encouraged her son (Christ or Maynard) to think freely and to form ideas and values that would benefit mankind. I am drunk right now, so this may sound like total rubbish, but I hope I hope passed on the message I intended to when I was sober a few hours ago.

He also doesnt beleive in Christianity as the religion God chose for us. I hope i dont offend anyone by this its just a thought.

About his mother, I think that any Christian knows that if u do good, beleive in Christianity and in redemption, then u shall be redeamed and find ur place in heaven. But not him, he asks God to forgive his mother, to take her in with his mercy because of how much she has suffered, and how good she was in her life:\r\n\"I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out.\r\nTen thousand days in the fire is long enough\" (asking God not to make her suffer hell after what shes been through)\r\nand\r\n\"Should you see your maker's face tonight. \r\nLook him in the eye \r\nLook him in the eye, and tell him. \r\nI never lived a lie, never took a life. \r\nBut surely saved one, hallelujah. \r\nIt's time for you to bring me home\"\r\nagain telling his mother to tell God that she lived a good life doing no harm or sin, and that He should take her in to paradise.\r\nOnly MY understanding of this song..\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_217": "\nI remember reading an article wher Maynard says something about what is going on in this discussion board.

Maynard succeeds in reflecting his emotins in his songs. I guess back then he expressed his angry-self with explosive bass-lines and thundering drums and screams of anger. Now I guess he feels a bit different about it all. He's more relaxed and rational. He pours wisdom with every line in this album. Look at the subjects of his songs, they are very deep.

Basicly anything that challenges the image that epople have to be just good etc.\n\r\nAnd I wouldnt think that Maynards mom has been in heaven BEFORE she dies, and the Judas part can be pretty hard to imagine too.\n\r\n\"Who could deny you were the one who illuminated.\" About Lucifer seeing something else than Gods laws.\n\r\nWhen its at the \"This little light of mine\" part, that could be about hes mom.

After a lot more listening though, it's definately all about Judith. If there is another party referred to in this song it's probably Christians.\r\n\"Feigning all the trials and the tribulations, none of us (Christians) have actually been there, not like you (Judith)\"\r\nMJK is referring to his mother and where others would feign suffering for the Lord e.g: giving 10% of their earnings, Judith had really 'been there' through 27 years of paralysis.\r\n\"But enough about the collective Judas\"\r\nthe 'collective Judas' refers to the 'ignorant siblings in the congregation' mentioned earlier in the song.\r\n\"Who could deny you were the one who illuminated your little piece of the divine\"\r\nJudith's faith was her 'little piece of the divine' In her suffering, perseverance and possible loving nature she 'illuminated' this.\r\nAs for the \"This little light of mine\" part, I'm not quite sure about it's meaning(s). It could mean Judith converted MJK or it could be something else. I'm pretty sure though that MJK isn't a devoted anything.\r\n\"Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough, you're going home\"\r\nChristian suffering and perseverance is also known as a 'refiner's fire.' this is supposed to test and strengthen one's faith as fire is used to test and strengthen metal. Judith was in this 'fire' for 27 years until she went home(died).\r\n\"You're the only one who can hold your head up high, shake yor fist at the gates saying 'I have come home now'!\"\r\nBecause of Judith's trial on Earth, she would undoubtedly recieve her reward in Heaven. This is why she can hold her head up high and shake her fist etc.\r\nAnyway this song is definately a loving tribute to MJK's mother with Christian undertones and I doubt it is in any way Satanic.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_224": "\nWhat I mean by Christian undertones is NOT that MJK has become a Christian and is now singing songs of praise.

You've missed the point. The song is very simple in it's meaning. When you over analize you miss the point. If you were faithful your whole life to a certain religion then when you died you should get your reward. Maynard obviously knows how much faith his mother had,and the song is meant to encourage her soul in the here after. If she was faithful then she better damn well get her wings. \r\nWithout a doubt wings for marie part 1&2 is the best song I have ever heard. Tool is doing what artists are meant to do. Change &  give new direction to their own craft and art. if you think that aniema or lateralus is the best then you have heard nothing from tool at all.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_260": "\nHEY ARCOIRIS!!\r\nI duno what youre talkin about, Mr rainbow, but man, i think youre crossing the line of SONG MEANINGS. The meaning is actually simple, and not that difficult to believe. MJKs mom died afte about 27 years of paralysis. Hence the album name \"10,000 Days\". I heard the song at least 11 times before i REALLY understood it. His voice, and the awesome crescendos give me chills to this day. \n\r\n\"You're the only one who can hold your head up high,\r\nShake your fists at the gates saying:\r\n\"I've come home now!\r\nFetch me the spirit, the son, and the father.\r\nTell them their pillar of faith has ascended.\r\nIt's time now!\r\nMy time now!\r\nGive me my, give me my wings!\"\r\nMy eyes got watery when i heard AND read this verse. He's telling his mom to basically demand her WELL DESEREVED spot in heaven with God. He's telling her to \"hold [her] head up high\" and GET her WINGS!!! \n\r\nIts a beauty of a rock song, and in a league of its own. Anyone who hears it (enough) wont be able to deny how emotionally CHARGED the song gets.

Making fun of their frantic need to have their egos pet and have themselves reassured that they're a good, God-fearing person. Then he states that he wants no part in it.\n\r\n\"Ignorant siblings in the congregation\r\nGather around spewing sympathy,\r\nSpare me.\"\n\r\nThe second part of this song is about his mother and how he misses her, but is at the same time thankful that God has finally taken her home. She's the only person he's ever known that can go up to the Almighty Himself and demand entrance into Bliss without worrying about being repimanded. She deserves it, unlike the sinful sheep you often see in churches today.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_263": "\nI really need to learn how to proof-read.

That is to create lyrics that are multi facetted so they mean not two things but many, many, more things. There are a few lyrics that have so many facets that I myself do not hear all of them. \r\nThat is the fun part of listening closely to a man like Keenan. To reach far down the path way of this man we have to start at the beginning of his career. In the song sweat he sings \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sweating, and breathing and staring and thinking and sinking deeper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This to me means more than one thing. The first thing is pondering over the words to put into the song. Second and in the bigger picture he is begging his over soul for over all success. As if to say please grow the musician inside me and never let go.\r\nThe over all complexity of not only the way Keenan sings but the tones and second meanings to all his music is very unique. However I feel a lot of people have this Cyclops view of his work. Not all people can comprehend nor hear all of what Keenan is trying to awaken from within him. To who and why is he singing so passionately in to the audience. For god sakes he covers him self with blue paint from head to foot. Then draws the Ajna chakra (third eye) and the Sahasrara or (the crown chakra) on his bald skull. What is the most fascinating and a dead giveaway is the color he uses to draw them. The metaphysical color of this particular chakra (the crown) is violet. \r\nSo what is the driving point to his madness? Keenan is looking for self enlightenment, and the awakening of the Kundalini serpent within all humans. Not to mention he reaches to someone, for something that if listened to with the right angle, you can get. It took me many years to learn why this man sings his heart out. For example, Keenan sings out to his projected best friend Veil of virtue hung to hide your method while I smile and laugh and dance and sing your praise and glory. There is more than one way to take these words.

Also, I'm pretty sure based on Tool's other songs they are critical of religion and are not religious at all.

The lyrics to this song are clearly indicative of his knowledge of God, he however, has chosen not to serve God, but rather he serves the devil. This band and every member in this band is knowingly willfully on their way to hell and they are fully aware of this fact. Anyone who reads into their lyrical content can clearly see this, and if you cannot see this you too are a new age fool! My issue with this band is their blatant blasphemy of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. Maynard sings all about think for yourself, do what thou wilt etc etc... these are ideologies he never came up with. It's funny how he tells us to think for ourselves and praises Satan and totally blasphemes Christ in songs like Eulogy. Doesn't sound like he wants any listener to think for themself does it? Use your brain people!!! This band and all the rest has sold their souls to the devil. Isn't it funny how  these people say there is no God but yet EVERY major band throughout history ALL sing about the devil! Is this by some random stochastic chance? Every man is born with a conscience, and God has given everyone that conscience, now it's what we do with it that matters. You either serve God or the Devil people its plain its simple! I think this songs expounds a plea he is making about his mothers faith he knows to be true even though he has chosen not to walk a similar path. He most likely is haunted tortured and tormented and will ultimatley face eternal torment unless he repents, but at this point God has probably turned him over to a reprobate mind! Further, I assert that there is no person alive who is atheist or agnostic. Every man or woman is born with a conscience from a child through their adult life. To say one does not believe in God or the existence thereof requires faith, and seeing as though no one can prove scientifically or otherwise that there is no God is no more or less faith that there is or isn't a God!!! Same with evolution! Unprovable! The devil wants you to be decieved and all of our consciences know right from wrong, and we know God exists, and if you say he doesn't well just wait til you are in a life and death situation the first thing most people say is oh God.....etc etc.... Think people! Use your brain! These men are losers and they work for the devil!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_322": "\nFirst of all, these two tracks are my favorite Tool songs, and it's not even that close. The climax of  \"give me my, give me my wings!\" might actually be my favorite part of any song ever.\n\nAnyways, I know I am late to the party, but I have read a lot of the comments and I feel like something is missing. Very simply put, this song is about the long suffering death of his mother (obviously.) Clearly she was a devout christian, and he juxtaposes her with others in the church who do not live the religion with every fiber of their being as she does. It is also a tribute, of sorts, to her. But mostly, it is expressing Maynard's anger at the hypocrisy and detriment of christianity. He is conflicted throughout the 10,000 days watching his amazing mother suffer so deeply, while clinging to the notion that she will be going to heaven, and Maynard knowing that she will not be. Why would God allow such a perfect example of faith suffer so long? \n\n\"fetch me the spirit the son and the father\ntell them their pillar of faith is ascending\nit's time now, my time now, give me my, give me my wings!\"\n\nSuch vivid imagery. I find myself actually shaking my fist as I belt this part out. I cannot think of another song with a more emotional and agonizing depiction. This poor woman spent all of those years suffering and clinging to the notion that she would be rewarded. In reality, though, this is about Maynard's suffering. She will die, and that will be it. She won't have to find out that her devotion was entirely wasted. Maynard has to live with the knowledge that the light that she was seeking, and probably deserved/earned, does not exist.\n\nI am astounded to read the opinions that this is somehow a return to faith for Maynard. This is not that at all. HE IS IN AGONY! \n\nAnyways, just my two cents. If anyone stumbles upon this, I would love to see a reply with what you think. \n\n*fingers crossed* and hopefully we'll see the new Tool album at some point in 2014!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_323": "\nBest thing to do with this songs : (Part I and Part II)\n\nAfter a long and hard working day, serve yourself a drink, shut almost all lights (or even better light up some candles), lay on your bed and press play.\n\nEvery troubles, stress and anxiety will vanish, leaving you in such a relaxed state that nothing can bother you anymore.
