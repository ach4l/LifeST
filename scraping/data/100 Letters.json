{"comment_0": "\nOk it's a song about a boy treating her like sexual object or with no dignity ei I'm not something to butter up and taste when you get bored also the boy says one day I realize why I don't have any friends she dumps him bc she knows her worth and know he's missing her and writes a 100 letters but she ignores him. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nWhen at her show only a few days ago she explained the song to us and she said that she used to have a boyfriend that would leave messages in the pockets of all her pants, usually saying things along the lines of \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re beautiful, I love you\u00e2\u0080\u009d. And the audience thought it was so beautiful until she said \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut unfortunately he treated me like s***\u00e2\u0080\u009d. She said that he treated her like she was nothing (hence the line \u00e2\u0080\u0098he said \u00e2\u0080\u009cone day I would realise why i don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any friends), and that it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for a really long time that she found her worth and what she believes she is, which was a lot more than her ex put her down to be (hence the line, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I said I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not something to butter up and taste when you get bored\u00e2\u0080\u0099). Anyway, she said that months after they broke up she would still find all those notes in her pants and so she got jack of it and took every single pair of pants she had and threw them in the wash, hoping to drown every single note left, thus the line: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You wrote 100 letters just for me. And I find them in my closet in the pockets of my jeans. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m constantly reminded of the time I was 19, every single one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forgotten in a laundromat machine\u00e2\u0080\u0099. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
