He lets the listener know he wants to address his personal issues with Hip-Hop but also allows a huge quantity of people to relate to the content of the song, the amount of people who find themselves in relationships which can be summed up be these lyrics can't be underestimated.\n\r\nThat, is why Eminem will always be up there with tupac looking down on the rest, he doesn't have to talk about shooting people and f*cking hookers to sell his music.

My opinion is it's capital BS & a completely self-defeating  attitude to buy into the idea that theres a secret society controlling or planning to control the world.  An organization existed at one point but to blame current problems on a faceless idea or set of powerful individuals just allows problems to continue & basically to says you're powerless to do anything because someone or something else has more power than you & they control things.  I'm not one to discount peoples view but this idea is a large steaming pile of horse-shit & frankly is dangerous cuz it can suck people into a pretty paranoid, totally unproductive state of mind.

And how it took over his life....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_53": "\nok, this song is not, i repeat, Not, about kim. it' about him realizing that being a hip-hop artist has taken over his life and pulled him away from everything he truly loves. it's about how even though he's sacrificed pretty much everything, he still hasn't gotten the thanks he deserves from the industry. he's trying to break away from the industry and all the evil inside of it because, now that he's sober, he sees that its taken away everything that he held dear. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_54": "\nI don't think it's about hip hop, but about drugs. I think we all agree that it's about something he's bringing to an end, but we know that he's still gonna rap and do hip hop. And if it was hip hop, why would he say: \r\n\"look at how i dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess\r\nalways in a rush to get back to you..\"\r\nhip hop is his work! while he is always in a rush during his work to get back to his drugs and they make him look messy...\r\nthen there's this line: \"I aint heard you yet\r\nnot even once say you apreciate me i deserve respect\"\r\nhip hop doesn't maybe treat him always as he deserves it, but it still said quiet often that it appreciates him. While drugs don't show you any appreciation, even if you devote your whole life to them.\r\n\"go marry someone else and make em famous\" --> His drug addiction made him famous, not hip hop.\r\n\"my friends keep asking why i cant just walk away Im addicted\" Why would his friends ask him to walk away from hip hop? But it's likely that they don't want him to do drugs.\r\n\"...but this time I aint changing my mind\" referring to his former attempts to defeat his drug addiction.\r\nThen the chorus. If he wanted he would stop doing hip hop, and that would be it. But you're affected by drugs your whole life (25 to life) even if you ain't an addict anymore.\n\n\n\n", "comment_55": "\nok i i have been reading quit abit about the connection to the illuminate and the music industry recently and it seem plausible and if what they say is to be believed then the next stage of eminem breaking away from the eliminate will be them destroying his image and then eventually killing him. i agree it seems a little out there but i will be watching closely to see what happens to him. supposedly michael jackson was killed by these people also.\n\r\nany how have a look at this see what ya think.\n\nyoutube.com/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_56": "\nI just wanna specify: I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT EMINEM AS A PERSON. I don't even listen to his music, for the most part... I just want to express how I interpret this song because it is very close and personal to me. I don't care if anyone disagrees with me or criticizes me, this is how the song makes me feel. \nTo me, this song connects to a past friendship I had. This \"friend\" wasn't much of a friend, and she basically became my worst enemy. Granted, we were in elementary school, so it wasn't terribly bad, but I may not be remembering correctly, either, and maybe it was worse than I remember. I do remember that she was essentially a bully, though, and she was my only friend, so I was scared to leave her because I would be alone. That's something that the line \"And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left\" particularly connects to. I felt trapped, just like the songwriter did; they were in a relationship with someone that treated them unfairly, but they felt that they had no choice. I know that may not be what it's really about, just remember, that is what it means to me on a personal level. \nThat's the general idea of the song, I think, and to add to it, the songwriter is walking away from the relationship. The same thing happened to me, so I understand how they feel there as well. \nAnd something that really stuck out to me in this song are the following lines: \n\n\"I'm addicted\nTo the pain, the stress, the drama\nI'm drown in so I guess I'm a mess\" \n\nThat is something I thought no one else felt. I have never met someone who has felt that way, who feels like they're addicted to pain, stress, drama, etc., and now here it is in a song... you have no idea how good it feels to know that there's someone else out there, even just one person, who feels that way. \nThat's just my view on this song. I know it's probably inaccurate, since I know nothing about Eminem's personal life, but I just wanted to express this view because it means a lot to me. \nI know I might sound stupid in saying this, but I would appreciate it if I didn't get any criticism on this... you have your view, I have mine. In the end, it's in the eye of the beholder.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_57": "\nno you guys I honestly it has to do with the Illuminati. think about it, it could totally just be a conver up as if he's talking about kim, but truthfully he's letting it all out. \n\r\nLook at this he seems as if he's done so much for them, but he has no respect back, he's done everything they demanded, he sacrificed himself. And what does he get back nothing.\n\r\nHe's sick and tired of keeping it in, and taking bullshit from them,\n\r\nimma take control of this relationship\r\ncommand it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit\r\nand what i mean is that i will no longer let you control me\r\nso you better hear me out, this much you owe me\r\ni gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you, while ive stayed\r\nfaithful all the way this is how i fucking get repaid\n\r\nhe doesn't care for it anymore and there for he's exposing them, to let everyone know, not to be brainwashed from all this bullshit in society. Watch just what happened to tu pac. Eminem seems so sick of it, he feels like he has been there little bitch and that he wont take it anymore. though hes has been addicted to it all, all the build up inside he just cant take it anymore and the only way for him to make everyone are to is to express it the only way he can. \n\n\n\n", "comment_58": "\nyupp he wants outt off the illuminati \r\nbecause if he was taking about kim \r\nhe says im going to be the boss off you goddammit which means il no longer let you control me\r\ndo you really think he was whippped?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_59": "\n\" though hes has been addicted to it all, all the build up inside he just cant take it anymore 'and the only way for him to make everyone are to is to express it the only way he can.' \"\n\r\nQuoting from nellsten.  Read this and you will know why all eminem fans have a combined I.Q. of 45.  Really? Listen to/support good hip hop.  Not this dude.

Eminem could be talking about his relationship with Kim, the obvious choice when he could be quoted saying \r\n\"I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made\r\nMaybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed\r\nBut I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid\r\nDown and died for you I no longer cried for you\"\r\nwhich is basically his relationship with Kim and another relationship.. with the Illuminati. Yup, i said it.\r\nIts really obvious too, but i guess you'd have to believe.. for example;\r\n\"Go marry someone else and make 'em famous\r\nAnd take away there freedom like you did to me\r\nTreat 'em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you\r\nFeed 'em the same shit you made me eat\" \r\nBasically here he's describing his relationship with the Illuminati. He's saying to go make someone else famous, which is what they do to artists. \"Take away their freedom\" says it all. You would just have to really pay attention.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_61": "\nI thinks its about how he signed a. Contract with the devil, and how when he did that satan mis treated him, so he is breaking his contract with satan and satan can go make someone else famous....
