{"comment_0": "\nI can't believe no one's commented on this yet. This song is amazing and has real powerful message behind it. I really don't see any point in explaining the lyrics, they speak for themselves quite clearly.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nAgreed. This song is great and sadly very true. Wale is a great underrated artist. His songs mean alot but arent hard to figure out like lupe fiasco's. He better not go mainstream. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
