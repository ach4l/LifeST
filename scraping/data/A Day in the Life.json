{"comment_0": "\nI believe the structure of the song is crucial to understand what it means;\n\nthe first part is about laying in bed, waiting to fall asleep, thinking of the day that is about to finish. he thinks of the irony in life, he can't help but laughing at someone dying in such an absurd way, after \"having made the grade\" in the life. the orchestral section is the moment when he falls alseep, with so much meaningless thinking going on (beautiful how the last thing he thinks is his loved one, and how he would like her to be there with him).\nThen he suddenly wakes up and starts his day routine; he has to hurry, no time for thinking; but then he smokes, and while people are talking about something he probably doesn't really care about, once again he goes away with his mind just like when he was about to sleep (\"i went into a dream\"), and again the orchestral section is the division between the everyday world and the world he has in his mind. Yet again, the last thought that comes to his mind is her... He'd love to turn her on...\n\nSorry about my poor english, i did my best\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nJohn contemplating a world that is quickly devolving and coming apart at the seems.. while at the same time moving into interesting new frontiers..  and his response to all of this is that of a slightly passive, stoned, outside observer...  his reflections are filtered through the world of media and art, all of which were in the process of becoming increasingly innovative and pervasive in everyone's lives.  The disinterested quality is kind of a product of that and, to my mind, was something that continued on through many years later, into the 90s, with the 'slacker' label we all got (rightfully so, perhaps). I wonder if there is also a subconcious thought he's having here about whether his contributions to this new emerging 'art', and that of his contemporaries, is really helping the situation, or just making it worse.  He was always so smart like that, being able to see both sides of the coin when it was most critical to have done so, but also when so few people actually were able to like him.  So, at the end of the day, I think this is a song that contemplates a life of confusion, bewilderment, ecstasy, ambilivence, engagement, tempation, violence, brilliance, all converging on eachother simultaneously... that's why you hear the cacophy at the end.. but remember, that's followed by the incredible 4 beatles all hitting the same chord on the grand pianos in unison (then followed by a loop of weirdo beatles chatter if you have the actual LP).  Good stuff.  Hardly gets any better.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\n\"He blew his mind out in a car\"\r\nThe car crash is about Tara Browne whose father was part of The House Of Lords. On 18 December 1966, Browne was driving with his girlfriend, model Suki Potier, in his Lotus Elan through South Kensington at a speed over 100mph. He failed to see a traffic light and proceeded through the junction of Redcliffe Square and Redcliffe Gardens, colliding with a parked lorry. He died of his injuries the following day.\n\r\n\"I saw a film today oh boy. The English army had just won the war\"\r\nJohn was in the film, How I Won the War which was about an inept British WWII commander who lead his troops to a series of misadventures in North Africa and Europe.

In the song, three key events are depicted; the man who died in the car crash, the movie about the English winning the war, and the holes in Blackburn's roads. For each one, the lyrics displayed the public's reaction to each occurrence. After each piece of negative news (in this case the gruesome car crash and the holes), the people could not get enough of it. \"A crowd of people stood and stared\" at the horrifying car crash, and the attention to detail was so great on the story in Lancashire that every hole in the streets was recorded and then relayed to the world. These pieces of negative news which amassed great attention contrasted to the movie about winning the war (a positive event in history because this song was written by UK writers), which received little to no consideration. \"A crowd of people turned away\" from the movie, thus highlighting the public's boredom with good news. The message of this song is that the news has turned our society into a world of cynics. Our news outlets feature only the ills of our time, always leaving out any sort of favorable news. This is the reason why after every time in the song when it said \"I read the news today\", it was immediately accompanied by an \"oh boy\". When was the last time you read news about a policeman who saved a man's life? Or about a child who beat an illness and survived? Our news instead is dominated by current atrocities; our ugly government and state politics, corrupt police murdering innocents, hate crimes, etc. We all have societal cravings to see the worst in our world. But we have to remember that we can't just look at the dark; there must be times when we can shed light on the good in our world.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nMany have noted the meaning of the small facts, strung along the way. What's the big picture?\n\nJohn's reading the newspaper. An impression one can't miss at the beginning is the contrast between John's unemotional vocals and diction and the first news item, about a man dying in a car crash, and people being unsure if they know him or not. The alienation of the people from the victim, and the voice of the singer (John, at this point) is jarring. The singer is emotionally dead to what's going on around him.\n\nAs he discusses the film, the unemotional tone continues. The singer doesn't respond to the power of death or war.\n\nWhen Paul takes over, we get a man (the same one who read the news?) rushing to get to work. In the middle of it all, he loses focus on what's going on around him, and goes into a dream. Again, a man detached from life.\n\nJohn comes back singing (as the same persona?) with another news story and resuming the flat tone.\n\nThe final line, which occurred once before, is the most significant statement: \"I'd love to turn you on.\" John's voice warbles teasingly, calling the most attention to this line. Turn you on\u00e2\u0080\u00a6with LSD? It doesn't matter. The problem with the persona (or personas) in the first 90% of the  song is the detachment from what's going on around him (or them). The statement of the song, the album, and possibly the Beatles' career is that they'd like to wake people up from that detachment.\n\nWhat this song is about isn't the details of the three or four small anecdotes. It's about the detachment, in John's and Paul's two different ways of narrating it, and how they'd like to turn us on. And for my money, the song, at least in some small way, accomplishes that.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI've always thought the song starts with \"About a lucky man who made the GRAVE\" which made the first verse be about suicide. The narrator reads the news about a man who had shot himself in a car while perhaps he hadn't noticed that his terrible situation had changed (to what the traffic light might allude to) and thus the situation is ironic/funny \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the man shot himself too early to realize things have resolved already. The shot makes his face unrecognizable and so people stand and stare out of shock, wondering if he is \u00e2\u0080\u0098famous\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\nThe narrator continues to tell about a movie that he saw and while people couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear to watch it, his interest was deeper and he continued till the end. This sets him apart from \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrowd of people\u00e2\u0080\u009d once again. The line \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to turn you on\u00e2\u0080\u009d, is what lies underneath all this distancing from the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrowd\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the man is in love and all the news/books/movies are just a fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of interests beneath which are the thoughts about the girl he wants.\nThe song switches to another narrator who is more upbeat and whose life is more structured and a little more stressful who does not have time to think about either a woman he might love or the news. His life revolves around the mundane activities of life.\nThe song switches back to the first narrator where he continues to leaf through the newspaper where he notices a peculiar story that he finds funny.

And although it could make more sense starting from the end & going backwards, the point he makes is quite clear. \n\nYes, he is talking about Potholes, but makes an omission because he believes that the upper class in the House of Lords consider the people who live in a shit-hole lesser than a Grade A Politician. And further then refers to people as \"holes\" by jesting that somehow poor people aren't good enough to understand music; the Albert Hall had a capacity of about 4,000 seats back then. \n\nHe also expresses his disdain for War, for people who turn their backs & bury their heads in the sand whilst keeping the typical English pride in winning wars, as well as hinting \"I'd Read the Book\" - as in Manifesto, which subsumes his initial remark \"Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords\" the very people or person who start wars, most potentially could have been distracted by one of the Potholes & got killed on the road.\"\n\n\"I Had to Laugh\" merely reassures the listeners that if the Rich don't care about the poor, the poor aren't about to care about them. Even from a human perspective. \n\n\"I'd love to turn you on\" is a play on words once again. At first, it would appear that John is being cheeky as usual! But he is also saying very covertly to those who introspect \"I'd love to turn you on to these issues\". \n\nIt's the only line he repeats & is a metaphor for the whole song. The Orchestral [orgasm] Crescendo is a clandestine statement that we can either make love, or war. [With the end of the song representing a Nuclear Explosion] \n\nPaul's section is merely there to play out as a philistine; a servile Joe worker who just daydreams his life's journey away with all the other passengers travelling in the same direction; \"being taken for a ride\". \n\nIn a nut shell, John is unhappy with all the things that segregate us & wishes everyone would stop long enough to come out of the dream. He had a point back then, & it is fundamentally quintessentially relevant now more than ever. \n\nIf only he had know about The Venus Project back then. I think he would have supported it :) No Poverty, Greed, Politics, or War?

I think this is what the House of Lords line refers to.  John was not very close to Tara, though they surely had met.  Paul, on the other hand, was a friend of Tara's.  Another cog in the Paul Is Dead controversy is the scar Paul got on his lip after wrecking a motorcycle while joyriding with Tara.  In the early morning hours of December 18, 1966, with his girlfriend Suki Poitier in the passenger seat, he sped through a red light in Redcliffe Square, swerved to miss an oncoming VW Bug, and slammed into a parked van, killing Tara.  Yet, Suki walked away hardly scratched.  In January, the article about Tara's death was run in the _Daily Mail_ and John put it in the song.

First, in the song \"sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band\", they sing, \"let me introduce to you, the one and only BILLY SHEARS\"  as we know, the beatles had no \"billy shears\".  They did this to spread the rumor that paul was dead, and that they replaced him with Billy (i don't recall the last name).  billy shears is saying \"billy's here\".

Paul contributed to this song in the section, \"Woke up, got out of bed...\" from an unfinished song he had been working on. Rather than complete the song, it's short verse was added here. Lennon's inspiration for the line \"he blew his mind out in a car,\" came from the death of their Irish friend, Tara Browne. In truth, Browne did not kill himself as the song implies, but rather Browne was killed in a car accident on December 18, 1966. He had been driving his Lotus Elan on Redcliffe Gardens when a Volkswagen pulled out in front of him, causing him to swerve his car, striking a parked van. Browne died on the way to the hospital. In writing the song, John reflected on this tragedy, yet the phrase, \"blew his mind out in a car,\" was in his mind when he was writing the verse. The details of the accident, such as he did not notice the traffic lights as well as a crowd appeared, were made up by Lennon.

The article was about a friend the beatles knew who really died in the accident.  Cant remember the name though, but he was the son of one of the House of Lords.  he actually ran the light, but alot of people believe he killed himself b/c of the line \"blew his mind out in a car.\"  the 2nd part of the song is the film lennon made after revolver and before pepper.  It was called How i won the war.  he had a small part in it, yet the line of seeing the english army win the war is about that movie.  Pauls part was a little song that he had seperate form lennons but wasn't doing anything with it.  They thought it would be great to put it in the middle of lennons song, which was originally called In the Life Of.  It is about paul thinking back to being a young schoolboy and rushing out of his house to go to school.  he would climb up to the top of the double decker bus and smoke a cigarette which was allowed.  lennons last part si another article about how they counted all the wholes in blackburn after WWII from the bombing.  The orchestra is only an idea that the beatles had about how to mend lennon and mccartneys parts together.  It sounds trippy so i'll give u that one, but it was only to mend the part together.

Sometimes reality seems like fiction. i have been told that the phrase \"i'd love to turn you on\" is a drug reference. \"turning on\" meant getting high back then i guess. John has said that the two events that inspired him to write the song were reading in the newspaper about Tara Browne's death and about plans to fill 4000 potholes in England. Now, of course that doesn't limit the meaning and it can be interpreted however. i mean, seriously, why would he write about potholes being filled if there wasn't something more to it? anyways just my two cents. i'll keep thinking about the song and maybe write something more later.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_121": "\nThe song is about perceptions, based on the hippie notion that the only way to change the world is by changing ourselves.\n\r\nLook at all the references to experience and perception- we are told the car driver (Tara Browne) blew his mind out, rather than his brain- death, in Lennon's state of mind when he wrote this song, was simply an end of perceptions. This continues in the rest of the song- reading the news, the narrator has the ability to make a car crash funny or sad, to make the Second World War something to deeply understand (\"read the book\"), and give holes in a road a significance equal to that of Tara Browne's death or simply ignore them.\n\r\nThe song works on two levels- the literal interpretation; someone so caught up in the mindless events of their daily routine that holes in a road, a war and a death are completely meaningless to them. \n\r\nOn a deeper level- the message seems to be that we take from life what we choose- we can be caught up in our boring daily routine, or we can give new meanings to things, as John Lennon was at the time due to his drug use.

That IS their genius, I agree.\n\r\nOn the other hand, The Rolling Stone (magazine, not band) History of Rock & Roll said that the Beatles, at the beginning, had nowhere else to start from, nor turn to, than rock and roll.  Consequently, the RS History of R&R concluded that the Beatles were the best rock and roll band ever.  And Lennon himself famously said, \"the blues is a chair\" [in which all makers of rock and roll (musicians) sit].\n\r\nTo The Old Revolutionary:  Your analysis that \"life is a dream and as the dreamers we have the ability to make it what they will\" (paraphrase) is a good one.   Yet, when trying to get his audience to let go of the Beatles, Lennon himself wrote \"The dream is over.  What can I say?\"\n\r\nAs for the song itself, it is a brilliantly put-together packaging of the quotidian elements of everday life, just as its title says.  People are fascinated by death and celebrity culture, as shown in the first verse about Tara Browne's death.\n\r\nThe next verse is indeed about the movie Lennon appeared in before the Beatles went into the studio to record SPLHCB.  No one has yet commented, however, that his line, \"A crowd of people turned away\" is about the fact that \"How I Won the War\" was a box office dud.  \n\r\nMcCartnery's middle eight sets the stage for \"I'd love to turn you on\" with the lines \"Found my way upstairs and had a smoke, and somebody spoke and I went into a dream,\" followed by the spacy, dream-like \"ah ah ah ah\" wordless singing that follows.  Sounds like a pot-smoking reverie (one of Paul's avowed favorite habits) to me!\n\r\nCaverngirl's explanation that it's not the holes themselves, but the asphalt needed to fill them that would fill the Albert Hall, rings true.  And, did anyone besides me notice that Condoleeza Rice was recently in Blackburn, Lancashire and said she had always wanted to go there because of loving A Day in the Life?\n\r\nIf you read George Martin's excellent book, \"All You Need is Ears,\" he talks extensively about recording this song.  The Beatles had to encourage the orchestra to play extemporaneously during the two build-up stretches.  The Beatles gave them the beginning and ending notes that they wanted,  then they and the orchestra's concert master walked among the musicians a got them to play those intense build-up sections the way we know them today.  The final chord was recorded by all four Beatles simultaneously on four concert grand pianos - no overdubbing used.\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is THE single greatest BEATLES song (emphasis intended). All four genius musicians and their equally brilliant producer were at the height of their powers, and contributed to a collective work of art.  It may never be surpassed in rock / pop music - it certainly hasn't been in the nearly forty years since it was recorded...  Hard to believe it's been that long, isn't it?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_147": "\nJames Michener wrote about \"A Day In The Life\" in his novel \"The Drifters\".

A day in 'the' life suggests he is talking about humanity as a whole, one collective life. The contradictions in the lyrics reveal John's attitudes.\r\n'I saw a film today Oh Boy' \r\nThe sarcasm in this line suggests that watching a film is not a very exciting experience. But John watched the film anyway, so life must be boring too.  \r\n'About a lucky man who made the grade' \r\nThe man is 'lucky' to make 'the grade.' This suggests the future is not too bright for the unlucky ones who don't make it, and also that we are judged by society on whether we do or don't 'make it.'\r\n'And though the film was rather sad, i just had to laugh.'\r\nJohn feels the opposite way as was intended by the filmmaker. \r\n'i saw the photograph' \r\nThis suggests that John has some inside knowledge that contradicts the film's message. A photograph, a crystalisation of the film medium, suggests John's insight is clearer. The film portays a version of reality that is so far out of alignment with John's perspective that it comes across as absurd and laughable.  \r\nJohn is portaying himself as an individual who opposes whatever the film represents, eg government, organised religion etc.\r\n'He blew his mind out in a car.'\r\nIf the 'lucky man' blew his mind out why is he lucky? Suicide is usually considered the worst kind of failure, so how did he 'make the grade?'  By equating suicide with good luck and success, John is telling us that his values are diametrically opposed to those of conventional society. \r\n'He didn't notice that the lights had changed'\r\nI think this is just black humor. He didn't notice the lights because his brains were all over the interior, pulp fiction style.\r\nOn another level, the lights changing could represent things getting better. John is saying he shouldn't have done it because life changes, 'tomorrow's another day.'\r\n'A crowd of people stood and stared, they'd seen his face before, nobody was really sure if he was from the house of lords.'\r\nThe masses crowd around the car, murmuring amongst themselves, hungry for blood and celebrity. \r\n'I saw a film today oh boy.  \r\n'The English Army had just won the war.' \r\nFrom reading the other posts i guess it's a reference to How I Won The War.  \r\n'A crowd of people turned away\r\nBut I just had to look\r\nHaving read the book.'\r\nOnce again 'a crowd of people' does something, and John is compelled to do the opposite. \r\n'The book' can only mean the Bible.  John is voicing his frustration at a so-called Christian Nation violating the principles of 'the book' by killing as they win 'the war.' The vast majority 'turns away,'\r\nthey don't want to know. John has read 'the book' and is compelled to 'look,' ie face up to it, expose it.    \r\n'I'd love to turn you on'\r\nThe Tim Leary way, ie i'd love to free your mind. \n\r\n'Woke up, got out of bed,\r\nDragged a comb across my head\r\nFound my way downstairs and drank a cup,\r\nAnd looking up I noticed I was late.\r\nFound my coat and grabbed my hat\r\nMade the bus in seconds flat\r\nFound my way upstairs and had a smoke,\r\nAnd somebody spoke and I went into a dream'\n\r\nThe mundane 'day in the life' section is a musical and lyrical  juxtaposition to the rest of the song, which tells us that the overall meaning of the song is not 'a day in the life' of an individual, but humanity as a whole, a universal expression of our ongoing human condition of suffering and uncertainty.\n\r\n'I heard the news today oh boy\r\nFour thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire\r\nAnd though the holes were rather small\r\nThey had to count them all\r\nNow they know how many holes it takes\r\nTo fill the Albert Hall.\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to turn you on'\n\r\nI thought the holes represented people, that's why they filled the albert hall. From reading the other posts i see he was referring to potholes. I think he's having a swipe at the absurdity of beaurocracies.\r\n'they had to count them all.'\r\nIf the holes do represent people then John is further distancing himself from society. To me that's what this song is really about - the confusion of a very intelligent mind struggling to understand why people are not all so enlightened as he. You get a sense of Lennon's aloofness and isolation.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:\n\r\nOn the Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) All the people are looking at a freshly dug grave.\n\r\n2.) Paul is holding the musical instrument cor anglais, and it is black, symbolizing death, and the only Beatle holding a black instrument. Where Paul is holding it with his left hand (being left-handed) he is displaying three fingers, meaning only three Beatles left?\n\r\n3.) This was the first album on Apple Records and the first album that the group wrote their name as \"Beatles,\" rather than \"The Beatles.\" This is inferred to mean that they are no longer a whole as in \"The,\" but now since there are only three, it is just \"Beatles.\"\n\r\n4.) The yellow hyacinth in the shape of a left-handed guitar only has three strings.\n\r\n5.) The doll in the red, black and white stripes has a car model on her lap next to her right hand. This model with red interior is supposed to mean the car in which Paul was killed and the red interior is blood.\n\r\n6.) The other three Beatles' are standing sideways behind the drum, except Paul who is standing forward.\n\r\n7.) On the drum is written in the center \"Lonely Hearts.\" Using a mirror, place it perpendicular to the center of the drum. Splitting the words \"Lonely Hearts\" in half, the combined writing reads - 1 ONE 1 X HE DIE. This means that the \"1 One 1\" equal three, or that Paul is gone, and the \"X\" is meant to cross out Paul. Between the words \"HE\" and \"DIE\" is an arrow that points directly to Paul.\n\r\n8.) The hand raised over Paul's head, is to mean \"death.\"\n\r\nThe Back Cover:\n\r\n1.) Paul is facing the back, which can mean that he is an imposter, or that he is dead.\n\r\n2.) George's right-hand index finger is pointing directly to the words \"five o'clock,\" the supposed time of the car crash.\n\r\n3.) That the song lyrics \"Within You, Without You,\" are printed over Paul's body.\n\r\nThe Songs:\n\r\n1.) Lovely Rita:\"When I caught a glimpse of Rita,\" and \"I took her home, I nearly made it.\"\n\r\n2.) A Day In The Life: \" He blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had changed. A crowd of people stood and stared, they'd seen his face before...\" \n\r\n3.) Good Morning, Good Morning: \"Nothing to do to save his life.\" \"People running around it's five o'clock.\" \n\r\n4.) She's Leaving Home: \"Wednesday morning at five o'clock.\"\n\r\n5.) Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: The reference to Billy Shears is supposed to be that of William (Billy) Campbell, the look-alike.\n\r\nMagical Mystery Tour\n\r\nThe Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) Paul is alleged to be the one in the \"black\" walrus suit.\n\r\n2.) In the booklet, Ringo's drums read \"Love the 3 Beatles.\"\n\r\n3.) In the picture where The Beatles' are wearing white tails, Paul is the only one with a black carnation, the other three have red. \n\r\n4.) When you hold the album cover to a mirror, the word \"Beatles\" is a phone number, which is 2317438. It has been said that if you had called this number back then, a recording came on saying, \"you're getting closer.\" Of course there is no area code etc., so I doubt this one too.\n\r\nThe Songs:\n\r\n1.) I Am The Walrus: At the end of the song, where the spoken words from the play King Lear are placed, you here \"O, untimely death!\" and of course as we know, \"The Walrus Was Paul.\"\n\r\n2.) Strawberry Fields Forever: When John Lennon says in the end of the song the words \"Cranberry Sauce,\" it was long believed to be he saying \"I Buried Paul.\" However, it was electronically manipulated to sound like he was saying \"I Buried Paul\" but he actually isn't. 3.) All You Need Is Love: At the end, Lennon says, \"Yes, he's dead.\"\n\r\nYellow Submarine\n\r\nThe Front and Back Covers\n\r\n1.) Lennon's hand raised over Paul's head, indicating \"death.\"\n\r\nThe Beatles (The White Album)\n\r\n1.) Glass Onion: The term used for a coffin with a glass top.\n\r\n2.) 'Don't Pass Me By: \"You were in a car crash....\"\n\r\n3.) Revolution 9: The words, \"Number nine, number nine,\" repeated many times are supposed to say when played backwards, \"dead man, turn me on dead man.\" The reference to the number 9 is supposed to be that of McCartney having nine letters.\n\r\nAbbey Road\n\r\nThe Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) The common meaning of the Beatles' dress - Lennon in white for a priest, Ringo as the undertaker, George as the grave digger, and of course Paul, in his bare feet, holding a cigarette in his right hand (being lefty) all means death.\n\r\n2,) The police vehicle parked to the right in the photograph is a morgue wagon. \n\r\n3.) The Volkswagen parked on the left side of the street has a tag that reads, \"LMW 28IF. This has been construed to mean \"LMW - Linda McCartney Weeps\" and the \"28IF\" means that Paul would have been 28 years old IF he had lived\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_195": "\nthis is a good'n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_196": "\nThe Beatles greatest song, if not the greatest song ever.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_197": "\nI don't think this has anything to do with the Paul is Dead thing.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, stormed out of a recording session after an argument with the other Beatles and rode off in his Austin-Healey, which he subsequently crashed.[5]\n\r\nThe story was largely pieced together by fans from the lyrics of several Beatles songs. The most common narrative includes the following pieces of evidence: \"He didn't notice that the lights had changed\" (\"A Day in the Life\") because he was busy watching the pretty girl on the pavement (the eponymous meter maid of \"Lovely Rita\") after narrowly missing her dressed in blue (she's said to be the blur on the back of Abbey Road) jaywalking (\"Blue Jay Way\"). He then crashed into a lamp-post (a car crash sound is heard in \"Revolution 9\" and \"A Day in the Life\"). He was pronounced dead on a \"Wednesday morning at 5 o'clock as the day begins\" (\"She's Leaving Home\"), and nobody found out this because the news was withheld: \"Wednesday morning papers didn't come\" (\"Lady Madonna\"). A funeral procession was held days later (as supposedly implied in the Abbey Road album cover). Adding fuel to the legend is the ending of \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\" Some believed John said \"I buried Paul\" in a slow deep voice over the final refrain. He later refuted that, stating that he said \"cranberry sauce.\"\n\r\nAccording to believers, McCartney was replaced with the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest. The name of this look-alike has been recorded as William Shears Campbell, Billy Shears (the name of the fictitious leader of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band), William Sheppard (based on the inspiration for the song \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\"), or some combination of the names.\n\r\nThere is no evidence of any sort of car crash in which McCartney was involved, although during the first week of January 1967, McCartney's custom-made Mini Cooper was wrecked by a friend on the M1 Motorway outside London. McCartney was involved in a moped crash on December 26, 1965, which resulted in a chipped tooth and the scar on his lip that can be seen on promotional videos for the \"Paperback Writer\"/\"Rain\" single, made shortly after the crash, in May 1966. According to McCartney, his desire to hide the scar on his lip was the impetus to grow a moustache; at about the same time the other three Beatles grew moustaches as well\u00e2\u0080\u0094in time for Sgt.

Lennon was a genius, he had been too far out all his life, from school were he was always in trouble, to an adult, where he was leader of the greatest band of all time. In the sixties there was a feelign amongst the youth that they were going to create a big change in society. Lennon was at the fore front of this, and as a result the authorites came down heavily on him. This song details Lennons feelings about normal society. He laughs at the \"sad\" news \" in the first verse. He looks when the crowd turns away in the second verse. In the final verse a piece of boring news about holes in the road in blackburn sets Lennons mind on a surreal flight of fancy. Lennons perception is different and more original than the rest of straight society and Lennon would love to turn on the rest of straight society to his perception. Mccartneys section again suggets that normal life is not satisfactory as he slips into a dream when he should be concentrating on getting to work on time.

McCartney could have not been dead at the time, simply because no other look-alike coul have played the bass as him (as in many other Beates songs but best than ever)!! In this song, the bass lines are the best I've ever heard. From the very beginning (coupling the piano, great notes too, and then going on as soloist instrument) the bass is the driving force of the song, greatly joined after by Ringo's drumming, and is unbeatable in creativity, dexterity and imagination, as is the song as a whole. I also agree that the lyrics are not related with the \"MCartney is dead\" stuff, paradoxically, more than reminiscings of the past (Paul's \"death\") the lyrics are still very actual if you look at the media's/reproters & politics attitudes, the celebrities overpresence all around, etc.  As someone said in a previous comment, the name of the song is not a coincidence, since the lyrics reflect what used to happened in our daily life.

Paul's middle eight at first seems odd, but to me it goes so well with John's lyric to paint such a vivid picture.  Probably my favorite Beatles song.\n\r\nAs to the meaning...\n\r\nFirst off this song was widely banned due to :drug references\".  Specifically, \"he blew his mind out in a car\", \"4000 holes\" and (improbably enough Paul's line) \"had a smoke and...went into a dream\".  John wrote his parts at Kenwood while watching tv (nearly muted) and scanning newspapers and magazines.  He often did this and seemed to absorb both sources of information on some nearly subconscious level. The man who \"blew his mind out in a car\" refers to the death of Tara Browne- a friend of Paul's.  The holes in Blackburn Lancashire are potholes.  \n\r\nJohn was definetley into drug use at this time, he counted himself into the song by saying \"sugar plum fairy\"- slang for a drug dealer, but the only \"real\" drug reference is \"I'd love to turn you on\".  By all accounts, that line was a collobaration between the two.  Contrary to what most believe the band was remarkably clean during the recording sessions.  John NEVER did LSD in the studio except for one accidental trip that found him freaked out and on the roof of Abbey Road Studios.\n\r\nPaul's middle eight was just a half-finished song that they made work.  As to the \"noise\", it's a forty-one piece orchestra told to go from the lowest notes on their instruments to the highest with no direction.   \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_237": "\nMedia and humans in general creating a desentisized, cold society, filled with such lonely hearts (aw yeah).

But when good news happens like the war ends, you're supposed to ignore that - it's just the way the world works! But then he suggests that we \"I'd love to turn you on...\" Let's TURN ON, let's really start living. Right then, a nightmare sets in - aaaalmost done, but nope, not yet, alarm clock, wake up, time for work!\n\r\nPaul's verse...I thought it to be a separate character, just living out his own life as well (because it's A day in the Life of anyone in particular). Normal guy, has a happy go-lucky morning, and all of a sudden BAM gets sent into a dream state, literally out of nowhere. Personally I always thought it's because he heard the news of the suicide, and goes into reflection, or it could just be the little everyday things that can just completely change a persons outlook on the world.\n\r\nThen it shifts right back into John's melancholy parts, the \"holes filling Albert Hall\" I just take as empty, lonely people who fill up city streets. And then, the crescendo sets in again...and this time, manages to reach it's apex, before finally making an end to it all.\n\r\nIs that nightmarish orchestra section what \"reality\" is, if they choose to ignore the fantasies we create and \"turn on\"? Is that final chord enlightenment after realizing the dream-like beauty of the world, or is it someone \"blowing their mind out\" out of depression after not being able to handle how insane the world is?

It is true that a trance like feeling is imbued into the lyrics which is direct contrast to the crescendo of piano chord being played on \"all the pianos they could find and bring down to their studio\" from within the studio building - which is strange in itself no?\n\nAnyway its about Paul dying in a car crash, just like so many of their amazingly weird and innovative and dark lyrics are after Nov. 66. I believe they were threatened so they felt obligated to spend countless hours dropping clues that are   everywhere in their album art and songs from Sgt Pepper on out .. and yet deny it. Still I love the Beatles, the original Paul and William Sheppard Campbell as well, who may have in fact been more musically talented than Paul, and believe that it was these confluence of factors that went into transforming the band from great to amazing.. even as they were falling apart from the stress of living a lie.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_279": "\nIs the whole urban legend , of Paul McCartney being killed in a fatal car crash in 1966 . Being replaced by Billy Shears.  Pretty much the entire ablum states messages that seem to pertain Paul died in 1966 . I wonder if we'll ever know \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_280": "\nDoes the final note at the end represent time standing still?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_281": "\nIn my interpretation the song has a load of elements that make it really blend together to tell a story of a character presumably John Lennon. The song begins in a sorrowful tone with John telling how he read the sad news of something happening to a person who has done well in life and how he finds it quite funny as it is ironic. In the next verse he goes on to say how this person \u00e2\u0080\u0098blew their mind out in a car, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t notice that the lights had changed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 this is referring to the person getting high and because of it failing to take in his surroundings properly and crashing, a crowd of people then come to look at the scene, intrigued as they all feel as though the person who crashed is familiar and possibly wealthy but they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pinpoint it. This links in with the first verse as John finds it ironic how this person is said to have made the grade yet he has died in such a horrible way  that contrasts this portrayal. The line \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to turn you on\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in my opinion is not anything sexual but more so that Lennon would love for the listener to be able to see things from his perspective, possibly through the use of drugs. The orchestra getting higher is a way to break up the different segments of the song and allow a pause after the I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to turn you on in order for it to have more of an impact. The song then changes to a more simple, uplifting tune to represent the now soberness of the main character as they get into their morning routine without truly thinking or taking anything in just doing things automatically. This is until the character or Lennon has a smoke and \u00e2\u0080\u0098somebody spoke and I fell into a dream\u00e2\u0080\u0099 this is showing the action of Lennon getting high again and zoning out of reality through his actions of not recognising who is speaking and not caring what they have to say as he goes into deep thought. A soft ahhhing then transitions the song back into its sorrowful initial tone as Lennon once again discusses the news. In my opinion the four thousand holes is about how people counted all these potholes along the roads instead of doing anything about that and then relating that to how there is around about four or five thousand seats in the Albert hall and each seat is occupied by a butt so therefore it takes four thousand holes (of a different kind) to fill the Albert hall, it could also be referring to how for each pothole counted instead of being fixed there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is one idiot doing the countin therefore for each pothole there is one idiot to fill the Albert hall ( and another term for idiot is.. ) the song then comes to a conclusion with a single note on the piano to in song form say the end.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_282": "\nJust one of many \"clues\" to Paul's death.
