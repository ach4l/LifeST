{"comment_0": "\nThis is my favorite Michael Buble song. I feel like i can relate to it cause it seems as if this is all an apology for everything that a guy did wrong. One of my ex girfriends was absolutely amazing and i let her slip away when i shouldnt have. I did some stuff that i shouldnt have and shes gone. Luckily we are still great friends but i cant hear this song with out thinking of her.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
