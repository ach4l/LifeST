It means roughly \"Glory to the spiritual master\" and has the focusing sound \"omm\" at the end. (Translation varies according to particular level of Sanskrit used for divination.)\" \n\r\nI found that here recmusicbeatles.com/public/files/faqs/\u2026    i hope that helps. :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI really love to listen to this song.  I'm quite sure what he is actually referring to when the song was written, but my interpretation would be the following:  Perhaps there is hope for peace or love through words and thoughts.  Maybe such words of joy, happiness and even sorrow are contagious.  \"Words are flying out like endless rain into a paper cup, \r\nThey slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe.\"  I think these words encourage the belief that such words of meaning and feeling, when spoken, can be passed on from person to the next just by the very sound of them and thoughts of them.  The very idea that love or sorrow exists, allows for love or sorrow to actually be.  Pass it on, those feelings and thoughts. \"Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing \r\nThrough my open views inciting and inviting me. \r\nLimitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns, \r\nIt calls me on and on across the universe\" -here it is explained how he is surrounded by words of feeling and hope.  encouraged by words of all people around the world.  not just a certain race or religion....just the kindness of humanity across all of the universe.   \n\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI think this song is, most of all about about achieving a state of mind where you no longer need to think, where your thoughts, your words and your concerns go away. It's about our lack of importance in relation to our world, our universe. It ridiculizes earthly worries, and urges us to open our senses and feel. Just feel everything around us, below us and above us. Become one with the universe and everything around us, lose our individuality and become unviversal. \r\nThe images in the first lines of the song represents this lack of importance of word, talking and worrying in general, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWords like endless rain into a paper cup\u00e2\u0080\u009d, paper cups can never keep rain inside of them, they are uncapable of holding them as we are uncapable to hold onto words, so he let's them go, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSlip away across the universe\u00e2\u0080\u009d, through meditation, that feeling of your head going \u00e2\u0080\u009cblank\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  \r\nThe next verses are about the feelings that fill overwhelm him, when he achieves that state. About letting everything into you, the good and the bad, and at the same time letting nothing affect you. \r\nEmbrace everything but remain unmoved, loving everything and accepting this things as inevitable and almost neccesary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, Possessing and caressing me\u00e2\u0080\u009d, opening your mind is the key element here. Then there's the mantra, it doesn't matter what it means, for me it's related to the way of getting into that state. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing's gonna change my world\u00e2\u0080\u009d may sound a little selfish, arrogant and close-minded at first (at least for me) and even more if you look at it as a sentence on its own. \r\nBut if you relate it with the context of the song (buddhist meditation) nothing's gonna change my world is really about accepting the world and the universe as it is, feeling happy and calm about it, wanting nothing more and nothing less of it. For me, it's more about not WANTING to change the world, not needing to do it, than not LETTING anyone change it, as a way of defending it or blinding ourselves. It's the same sense of peace, tranquility, conformity and of communion with the self and the world of the entire song. It really embodies the entire concept. It's almost the inverse of being selfish, it's about abandoning one self and becoming whole with everything that's outside of us, achieving inner peace. \r\nThe verses that follow this chorus, \"Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,\", in my opinion are much more open to interpretation. For me, these images are a metaphor of the stars, of the open universe in it's literall meaning, the one we think about when we hear the word universe. It's about a calling to it's beauty, and later, the star's call for us to join them across the universe, these are just beautifull images that add to the song\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mood of mysticism. It is a literal image of us elevating through meditation and joining the stars, our universe.\r\nThe lines that follows, continues with the idea of the lack of importance of our tribulations here on earth, and the our need to let them go. Once again our attempts of getting ahold of them are ridiculized by the image of the wind inside a letter box, another impossible attempt. The quick passing of our problems here on earth is emphasized, they are put in perspective in relation with that that is more important, finding peace and love. Our need to focus on more important matters.\r\n\"Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing Through my open views inciting and inviting me.\" This relates once again with the lines about opening your mind and senses and letting the world in. \"Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns\u00e2\u0080\u009d is another metaphor of the way he feels the love of the world surrounding him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt calls me on and on across the universe\", the same structure is repeated. This verses are another sublimation of the state of mind achieved through meditation.\r\nMost of all is the call for us to be there, to reach for that eternal love, to becoming one with ourselves, our universe, our gods, with our love, with our joy, with our sorrow, with everything. Embracing not only the good but the bad in order to feel everything and love as we are loved inconditionally by the world. \r\nLove is once again (as its common in the amazing world of the Beatles songs), the main theme of this song, love for everything on earth. This idea is related to the desire of losing individuality, and the frustration this individuality carries (trying to hold on to things, and the immposibilty to do so), and the almost neccesary search for something that is superior to us, in order to be at peace with ourselves and with our universe.\r\nI hope this is useful! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my way of seeing this incredible song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nIf you ever sit and close your eyes and exist in your own head you are just a small piece in everything that exists, like the universe.  When our mind is open its as big as the universe. Everything we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen, said, imagined, light, all the people we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever known, mixes of words and letters, our memories, they all exist in our minds, and they float around there undisturbed but in relation to each other, moving in harmony with each other and accepting and being thankful to this giant place they have to exist and be apart of because it is so magnificent.  When we go into our mind everything in that universe is accepting they want to share their happiness with everything else, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true happiness and comfort. Something people should be in search of in their lives in the real universe where people have become greedy of the objects that were so friendly and loving to us in our mind, when we treat parts of this universe badly things are not balanced, they are not in harmony. But when we find our own universe in our mind its so powerful it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so inviting, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so attractive, and we love it just like every other piece of the universe does.  And the truth is no one can take the universe we have in our mind, no one.  No one can ruin or change our universe like they can change the world we live in, and nothing could hurt it anyway because there is so much love to a limitless extent that nothing could disturb the peace. The feeling when we are loved and we give love is one we should never forget in order to make the real world more peaceful.  To the people who complain about people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know who wrote the song, remember the meaning of the song first, because in the end the lyrics of the song and the sound that comes from the song are what matters most, because we share these words and sounds with the universe.  We shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be obsessed with the idea of ownership.  Do you think the lyrics in this song want to be captured by a person? No, they want to be in harmony with the rest of the world.  With any song, with any music there is harmony between the words and the singer, the notes and the player.  When anyone sings this song it is just harmony it is the musician and the song harmonizing together giving each other love, thanks, and giving care for each other. As long as we give love to people in this world we are not wasting the time we have in this world.  It would be nice if one day things can be in harmony as they are when we fall into our minds, I do hope that eventually all people won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so greedy as to take away happiness from others, but to give it. Because I love being apart of my universe as John Lennon loves being apart of his universe, and as a lot of people and words and memories, and songs love being apart of their universe. So maybe someday we can share our minds with others and they share with us, to bring our own universes to the universe we live in.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nIt's a description of nascent attempts to meditate and become one with the universe.\r\nJai Guru Deva is just some thing to help the process and has no significant meaning.\r\nThis is how most new comers to meditation feel what it would be like.\r\nMind is trying to let go.. and the soul is trying to become.. but the Mind is vicious and it doesn't let go so easily..

He also understood that he had become a spokesperson for the world. His confidence and belief in himself had become completely reassuring.\n\r\n\"Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind\r\nPossessing and caressing me.\"\n\r\nJohn allows us inside his mind, while surrendering his vulnerabilities to us. Although he expresses \"waves of joy which caress him,\" to his delight - he also delivers voluntarily a \"possessing sorrow,\" which most humans rarely admit to because they fear societal ridicule, which in turn, naturally leaves those, who are too afraid to look within, in spiritual darkness.\n\r\n\"Jai guru deva om...\" \n\r\nJai guru deva simply means, Praise to the victorious one, or to the one on high. John praises the natural forces of energy which provides for us our feelings and needs of love and peace. As for \"om\", it is the \"hum\" monks verbalize while in a state of meditative consciousness. While in such a state, monks claim to hear the earth's wobble, thus the reason for their hum (om). They simply attempt to replicate the \"wobble\" they feel so completely in-tune with. I gather John attributed such unworldly vocalizations to his own spiritual consciousness, using music and poetry as his tools to communicate such enlightenment.\n\r\n\"Nothing's going to change my world...\"\n\r\nJohn knew at that point in his life there was no turning back. He had become enlightened through life's lessons, and had achieved a sort of nirvana by simply practicing the principals of love in his every day world.\n\r\n\"Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes that call me on and on across the universe.\"\n\r\nIn the sentence above, John asserts that something greater than himself is calling him on to relay his poetry to a greater universal audience.\n\r\n\"Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox...\"\n\r\nHere, John's telling us that his thoughts are rambling fluently without even trying. In a way that suggest he is an involuntary poetic messenger for some greater force which dominates him.\n\r\n\"...They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.\"\n\r\nJohn recognizes that words, much like life itself, can never be, nor should be, harnessed or controlled. John knew that such controls are to be avoided if one wishes to acheive the height of their awareness.\n\r\n\"Sounds of laughter, shades of earth are ringing through my open mind inciting and inviting me.\"\n\r\nJohn is expressing that he has reached his personal spiritual plateau and is propelled by it's enormous possibilities.\n\r\n\"Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns, it calls me on and on across the universe.\"\n\r\nIn the end John realizes that it is a \"limitless undying love\" which \"shines\" and \"calls him on\" to verbalize his poetry \"across the universe\" to all races. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nWell, you know what they say about opinions...\n\nBut that's what I like about literature, or anything \"authored\" for entertainment.  It's always left up to the individual's own interpretation.  Because everyone's' not going to agree anyway.  That's what's cool; no one's wrong.  It's the whole opinion thing. \n\nThis is a song written by John Lennon, for John Lennon.  For his thoughts to be taken or left.  'I believe', was his mindset.  And why not?!  He's putting it out there and you don't have to listen, right.\n\nSo, 'I believe' the message to be:  Throughout all of his experiences and travels, whether physically or chemically induced; he's telling us what we may experience, metaphorically.

I was lying next to my first wife in bed, (song originally written in 1967) you know, and I was irritated. She must have been going on and on about something and she'd gone to sleep-- and I kept hearing these words over and over, flowing like an endless stream. I went downstairs and it turned into a sort of cosmic song rather than an irritated song-- rather than 'Why are you always mouthing off at me?' or whatever, right? ...and I've sat down and looked at it and said, 'Can I write another one with this meter?' It's so interesting. 'Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup/ They slither while the pass, they slip away across the universe.' Such an extraordinary meter and I can never repeat it! It's not a matter of craftsmanship-- it wrote itself. It drove me out of bed. I didn't want to write it... and I couldn't get to sleep until I put it on paper... It's like being possessed-- like a psychic or a medium. The thing has to go down. It won't let you sleep, so you have to get up, make it into something, and then you're allowed to sleep. That's always in the middle of the night when you're half-awake or tired and your critical facilities are switched off.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_76": "\nYou kids need an old hippie to explain things to you, it seems. Some of you have this right and some of you are just speculating wildly. Those of you who think George wrote or sang this song do not know your Beatle history and cannot even hear the difference in their recorded voices. This is sad.\n\r\nIt's John Lennon, of course, and he's writing about the trenscendental meditation experience. Some of you have translated Jai Guru Dev already, you're right. It's what TM meditators say at the end of their sessions and it's praise for Maharishi's guru (teacher), who has become the guru of all TM meditators due their training by Maharishi. I suppose when Maharishi dies the honor could pass to him. Gurus receive devotion and respect from their students, it's an age-old Indian tradition.\n\r\nThe lyrics are written by John but are taken from the many analagies that Maharishi liked to use to describe the way thoughts float around in one's mind while in a mediatative state. Maharishi was quite talkative and loved explaining concepts through analagies. Hinduism says that there are states of conciousness that exist at a deeper place in our minds and that it is possible to access them through daily meditation, in which we are trained not to dwell on these passing thoughts. \n\r\nSo what John did was to turn his TM training into a poem. He was iintitally very taken with TM but later became disaffected with it and with Maharishi. I suspect that John's own powerful ego could not abide the competition. Go listen to \"Sexy Sadie\" and insert \"Maharishi\" in place of the title.\n\r\nTry to find the versionj of this that was not botched by Phil Spector for the first Let It Be album.

I couldn't quite make out the last syllable. Actually my words fit well with the rest of the song. One could rue the day or just accept what has happened because nothing's gonna change it anyway. The singing recognizes he could sit and rue or accept; he chooses to accept what has happened or will happen depending on what prespective your looking from. It is saying that to feel sorrow along with joy is ok, but don't let sorrow turn to regret move on. My words may be less mystical than Lennon's but seem more more logical. At least I think it fits the song. And by the way, it definitely has facets of Pink Floyd in it; from the song Echoes. \"Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes inviting and inciting me to rise. And though the window in the wall come streaming in on sunlight wings, a million bright ambassadors of morning\". The words \"inviting and inciting\" were interchanged to avoid copywrite infringments. (ha-ha) Really great song.

Even though, it may have these chants on and off. The actual lyric could just as well be a prayer or an offering. Uber Brilliant meditative quality to the lyrics here. \r\n  From Hindu mythology,( They slither while they pass, .....of joy are drifting through......)\r\n You are looking at a snake. Any snake is capable of re-generating. It will often eat it's own skin. (There is a symbolic and ever present bow to CHANGES.) And then morph into something completely new. Renewing and extinguishing itself. Another perhaps interesting and somewhat unknown perspective would be the fact that snakes are often known to be as protectors. In ancient Hindu Kingdoms a snake would often be around a noble king (like a pet). When the king would rest the snake would also look after him/her.  \r\n OK, that might be a bit of a stretch. But if you consider, that the Beatles (even half) would be the Kings of modern popular music then it kinda applies to a certain extent. And I also, think that nn1000 above here did summarize everything else there might have been to this song. This song is a Zen symphony and a spiritual mantra to tune into, all rolled into one. Enjoy.

The interviewer threw out the song titles and John, as was his fashion, said what he thought on that particular song and things going on at that time.\n\r\nPLAYBOY: \"Across the Universe.\"\r\nLENNON: The Beatles didn't make a good record of \"Across the Universe.\" I think subconsciously we -- I thought Paul subconsciously tried to destroy my great songs. We would play experimental games with my great pieces, like \"Strawberry Fields,\" which I always felt was badly recorded. It worked, but it wasn't what it could have been. I allowed it, though. We would spend hours doing little, detailed cleaning up on Paul's songs, but when it came to mine -- especially a great song like \"Strawberry Fields\" or \"Across the Universe\" -- somehow an atmosphere of looseness and experimentation would come up.\r\nPLAYBOY: Sabotage?\r\nLENNON: Subconscious sabotage. I was hurt too . . . Paul will deny it, because he has a bland face and will say this doesn't exist. This is the kind of thing I'm talking about where I was always seeing what was going on and began to think, Well, maybe I'm paranoid. But it is not paranoid. It is the absolute truth. The same thing happened to \"Across the Universe.\" The song was never done properly.

Pools of sorrow waves of joy could be his life passing before his eyes. The images of broken light beckoned him to cross over to the eternal life. Looking down upon Earth, he saw the vigils, the gatherings, the tributes-the outpouring of limitless undying love. Nothing was going to change his world, so he went on to a new one. \r\nSure it's a stretch, but there are somethings in this world that are beyond comprehension.\r\nAnd to those negative people out there-yes, I know John wrote this in late '67-early '68 and was killed in 1980.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_120": "\nThis is one of my favorite Beatles songs.

It was originally released in a charity LP release with all kinds of animal sounds and was sped up a tad. Its next incarnation was on the Let It Be LP which was probably one of the better arrangements that Phil Spector produced on that album.

But nn10000 I'm gonna have to disagree with you on a few points. \r\nFor starters, there's no way you can conflate \"pools of sorrow\" and \"waves of joy\" into one lump understanding that both are about emotion overwhelming him. I think that the \"pools of sorrow\" are possessing and the \"waves of joy\" are caressing, and it's a fundamental shift in thinking. The pool is stagnant, its permanent, but it's also weak. The wave is quick, powerful, but fleeting. The wave simply cannot possess, because it isn't around long enough to. Rather, when a wave buffets against the rocks, it caresses and then quickly steps aside.\n\r\nJohn is possessed with sorrow in this movie, and the waves of joy that come against his shore quickly retreat, unable to solve the main problem of futility that runs throughout the song.\n\r\nI don't think 'nothing's gonna change my world' is an arrogant statement of defiance against the world. But I don't think it's a statement of oneness with the universe either. He repeats it too much, he needs convincing - and John knows what the 'refrain' of a song really means. It means it 'refrains' the music and meaning from going any further, it's a restriction and boundary that he's meeting up against.\n\r\n\"Nothing's gonna change my world\" means that despite his best efforts, he can't change his course. He's not in control of the situation. He's trying to catch words in paper cups but they just slip by. He's being called \"on and on across the universe\" because it's so far away.\n\r\nWhat I love the most about this song is the sense of space. The notes on \"rain into a paper cup\" or \"wind inside a letter box\" sound like twinkling stars, just two notes alternating between them create this wonderful vacuum for John to play in. Even the opening glissando - from low to high - it's conveying space. And when we're dragged across this space, across the universe, with no end in sight and unable to control it, it's frustrating as hell.\n\r\n- \"restless wind inside a letter box\" is an anxiety about being trapped\r\n- \"sounds of laughter, shades of earth\" are suggestions of beauty that ring through him, but they *aren't the things themselves.* He can never get laughter, or earth, just mere hints of those wonderful things. They call him on, and he goes on an endless search for them.\n\r\nIn the end, \"nothing's gonna change my world\" is a resignation that no matter what we do in our own world, we can't fix the problem. We can't reconcile.\n\r\nI think this song is darker and more desperate than people have been giving it credit for.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_126": "\nThis song is written by John Lennon and about the actual process of writing.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_127": "\nthe Jai guru deva om part is actually meant to mean,\r\ngracious heavenly guru.and the omm is the vibration of the univerese.as we al know and love and are polluting.but,the song was written when they were in Rakikikesh and that's where they got the line Jai guru deva om.but it is very heavenly and melodic song.i strongly recommend listening to it when falling in love.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_128": "\nObviously about some hallucinogin.

Without this context it makes no sense.\n\r\nIt desribes the process of meditating: \"words are flowing out like endless rain...\" John is at once thinking, and detached from his thoughts. He is evidently deeply into his program, as he describes his experiences of feeling his thoughts and impulses eminating from him, outward, across the universe.\n\r\nThis is a very accurate description of the experience of practicing TM, and hearing sounds coming in through a window, and feeling the inner bliss bubbling up: \"Sounds of laughter, shades of earth, are ringing through my open mind, inciting and inviting me. Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns, it calls me on and on across the universe.\"\n\r\nEven with the eyes closed, \"images of broken light\" come in through the eyelids, and the light is also part of his inner light, emanating and reaching everywhere in creation (an important part of Maharishi's vedic teaching, how everything affects everything else in creation, which is one of the important principles of TM and vedic knowledge).\n\r\nJai Guru Deva is the traditional sanscrit reminder of thanks to the guru of the holy tradition. In this case, it refers to Maharishi's master, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, generally called \"Guru Dev.\" Maharishi ends virtually every talk with \"Jai Guru Dev,\" loosely translated as \"thanks to the master,\" more precisely translated as \"All glory to the master of the gods.\"\n\r\n\"Om\" is a traditional vedic mantra used by recluses and not householders, and therefore was not used or recommended by Maharishi duringthis course, but usually gets asked about it by course participants. My guess is the John thought it fit the end of the sanscrit phrase as a tag on like \"oh.\" Also, he was always a bit of a bad boy even around Maharishi, and probably fancied using it in spite of Maharishi's advice.\n\r\nThe \"nothing's gonna change my world\" line has to do with the Wildlife Foundation, to whom John donated the song, and seems to be a declaration wanting to protect the natural environment. But it may also be a description of the eternal nature of John's inner life. My guess is that after rounding for a few weeks he was identifying with his inner immortal consciousness.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_130": "\ni love the richness of the verses and their meanings, but...\n\r\n\"nothing's gonna change my world\".\n\r\nthis, to me, changes the song so much. my experience with transcendental meditation is using it as a tool to, indeed, change your world. to better yourself. to open yourself up to more possibilities.\n\r\ni can't really reconcile the dichotomy...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_131": "\nhands down my favorite song of all time. interesting how john lennon wasn't happy with the way ti turned out, i think it's brilliant and perfect as it is. \n\r\nin my opinion (and sorry to all of you with super long posts on the topic) the meaning of this song isn't as deep as some people try to make it. i think john lennon was trying to emphasis the sort of cosmic feel of the song and not some deep philisophical meaning.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_132": "\nthis song is a moment of clarity. sunshine though the trees, re birth, a wave of happiness, the realisation of nature taking care of you, realisation of God.

This song is a moment of peace amid the turmoil. Ultimately Lennon was a peacefull soul. But what has produced this moment of peace? Is it the teachings of eastern religion that Lennon was experimenting with at the time? Is it simply an artificial drug rush.

It seems like a really bittersweet kind of moment that could occur, and i think thats supported by the whole \"possessing and caressing\" part. The thing i think of when it comes to possessing is the lack of freedom, or when something takes over...just an overall negative connotation. And the word caress or caressing reminds me of like love, sex, tenderness, etc.\n\r\n\"Jai guru deva om\r\nNothing's gonna change my world\" \n\r\nI believe \"Jai guru deva om\" is Sanskrit for \"Hail To The Divine Guru\" (if my wikipedia searching skills are good lol). I think this is a religious thing for John Lennon, as if he's saying \"These are my beliefs, this is my world as i know it. And I don't intend on changing it whatsoever.\"\n\r\nOverall the song to me is about how people have tried to change Lennon in his ways of thinking, and he has stood strong in what he believes. It also says about how hes been tempted a few times (The part about \"Sounds of laughter, shades of earth, are ringing through my open mind Inciting and inviting me\" stands out for me) but in the end the chorus is his main message- Nothing is going to change his world.

The lyrics \"words are pouring out like endless rain into a paper cup...\" could have referred to he and Cynthia, and how their love no longer had effect on him after meeting Yoko. \"Limitless undying love...calls me on and on\" would refer to the love that John felt he could have if he left Cynthia for Yoko. \"Jai Guru Deva Om\" is a mantra, which John would have chanted while meditating. This lyric is followed by \"nothing's gonna change my world.\" Perhaps John used meditation in an attempt to clear his mind of the confusion of his love for Yoko and for Cynthia. However, he is always reminded that no matter how much he meditates, it won't change the fact that he is still stuck. The song tells the story of John's inner conflict about his dying love for Cynthia and his new found love for Yoko Ono, and his feelings of being stuck in his life and relationship. Or so I think :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_171": "\nlsd\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_172": "\nI can always learn more useful words through these comments of beatles.Thank you guys.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_173": "\nLennon: I was lying next to my first wife in bed and I was thinking.

I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t own it; it came through like that.\n\r\nLennon: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the best lyrics I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve written. In fact, it could be the best. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good poetry, or whatever you call it, without chewing it. See, the ones I like are the ones that stand as words, without melody. They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to have any melody, like a poem, you can read them.\n\r\nLennon: This was one of my favorite songs, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been issued in so many forms that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missed it as a record. I gave it at first to the World Wildlife Fund, but they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do much with it, and then we put it on the Let It Be album.\n\r\nEmerick: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAcross the Universe\u00e2\u0080\u009d was probably the gentlest, sweetest John Lennon song I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d heard to date, and it took me very much by surprise.\n\r\nEmerick: We recorded that vocal over and over again because John was unhappy with the job he was doing, despite the fact that we, and the entire group, were effusive in our praise.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_174": "\nI think were on LSD when writing this song.

Oh well.\n\nWords are flowing out like \nEndless rain into a paper cup\nThey slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.\nPools of sorrow waves of joy\nAre drifting through my opened mind\nPossessing and caressing me.\n\n\nSo I think it's maybe about things we all say that flow out like endless rain into a paper cup - we never stop talking about meanless things . I mean, we all say so many things with no meanings as an endless rain into a paper cup - into people's mind. \n\"Pools of sorrow waves of joy\nAre drifting through my opened mind\"\nObviously, it's a metaphor. The \"pools of sorrow\" and the \"waves of joy\" are \"drifting through my opened mind\"- So many thoughts of good and bad are in the singer, teller, writer 's mind that are \"possessing and caressing\" him, makes him stronger, with a thoughtfull life which he's managing, he becomes powerful by the power of his opened mind.\n\nJai Guru Deva. Om\nNothing's gonna change my world\nNothing's gonna change my world\nNothing's gonna change my world\nNothing's gonna change my world\n\nSo the \"Jai Guru Deva. Om\" is a mantra intended to lull the mind into a higher consciousness. The words are in Sanskrit, and they mean \"I give thanks to Guru Dev,\" who was the teacher of The Maharishi. The \"Um\" at the end is the drawn out \"oooohm\" used in meditation to relate to the natural vibration of the universe.\nBut what can possibly change his world?\nI think it refers the meanless words which people say all the time.\n(It reminds me a bit of bullying). Nothing can change MY world-\ndoes that mean he has the 'perfect' world? maybe. But the fact it is being so perfect, no one can change it, because he is in his world, fantasy maybe, and he is strong enough to struggle the thoughts and words.\n\n\nImages of broken light, which \nDance before me like a million eyes,\nThey call me on and on across the universe.\nThoughts meander like a \nRestless wind inside a letter box\nThey tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.\n\nSo this one is a little bit more complicated because the images of broken lights which dance before the writer like a million eyes... I'm not sure what does that mean. Maybe the milion eyes are the audience who admired The Beatles, and those broken lights... Maybe he was just taking drugs... I don't know, again, if I were sadder, I would probably know what he refers to...\n\n\n\n\nJai Guru Deva. Om\nNothing's gonna change my world\nNothing's gonna change my world\nNothing's gonna change my world\nNothing's gonna change my world\n\nThis time I believe (except it is the chorus)it is being an emphasis.\n\nSounds of laughter, shades of life\nAre ringing through my opened ears \nInciting and inviting me.\nLimitless undying love, which\nShines around me like a million suns,\nIt calls me on and on across the universe\n\nLaugher? Drugs?\nso the \"shades of life\nAre ringing through my opened ears\" sentence must be a metaphor.\nThe shades of life... Hm.. Maybe the shades of life are the memories that went behind the writer from all of his living life's experiences...\nIn this song there are lots of contrasts - like something which is described as hearing but you can only see it.\nSo when something is incinting and inviting the writer..\nI think he tried to tell us how the world is confusing, bad is mixed with good, up is down and down is up, everything is messed up, but when you REALLY realize that, nothing can change your world because it is being too predictable as you try to make it more colorful, interesting, so when something is so easy to guess, no news can change it, but you. \n\n\nJai Guru Deva.\nJai Guru Deva.\nJai Guru Deva.\nNothing's gonna change my world\nNothing's gonna change my world\nNothing's gonna change my world\nNothing's gonna change my world\n\nEnd. :) \nAnd come on people, this is not THAT hard. Everyone can change his own world, but no one can really change yours. \nAnd it is so easy to be guessed, that even a thirteen year-old girl with no experience can figure it out ;)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_176": "\n'nothing's gonna change my world.'  i feel like that's what it sounds like to completely give up on any hope or positivity.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_177": "\nIs just about a trip...

It's not saying my world is staying the same because there's nothing that can change it, but instead \"nothing\" as a state of being (consciousness is empty) has been felt and that is life changing.

If one looks at, hears, or otherwise senses a piece of art done by someone else, then the artist no longer owns it.  Thus, the 'meaning' of a piece of art depends upon WHO views (or creates it) and WHEN that person views it or creates it.  Even the creator may have DIFFERENT ideas about what the art feels like to him or her at different times.  I have seen artists, when asked what a piece of art \"means\", answer, \"I don't remember\" or \"I don't know\".  So as you read these thoughts about \"Across the Universe\" and its 'meaning', I'd encourage you to hear the song, including whatever you like (the vocal, the lyrics, the musicians, the arrangement) and decide FOR YOU at the time you hear it what it FEELS like.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_184": "\nI know!

Fiona Apple sings gorgeousely and the song fits her so well. It fits in among her songs as if it was her own. She adapted a song which held great meaning, and glorified it. The song is so alike her own, I would think she and its author work on parallel lines of thought. She sung it masterfully and, I think, her version is smoother than the origional. She slowed it down, which, I think, is more fitting. She sings it somberly, which fits the lyrics better. The guitar playing is better, too, I think. It's played more... flowy, as if the notes are slurred. In the origional, the notes are sometimes plucked, it seems. I don't feel that effect matches the lyrics. I also like Fiona's ending better.

It seems weird that someone would jsut write these words out of knowwhere. maybe it is just meditation, but the point of meditation is that your supposed to supress your feelings and not focus on them, because while meditating the aim is to be completely relaxed and carefree, which is hard if your worried about all kinds of things, which in this song it seems that john is feeling all kinds of different emotions at once, which is remarkably similar to how you feel while on lsd. you feel surges of strong emotions,incredibly happy for no reason, or incredibly sad, to me it seems as if john is feeling so many emotions and that all these emotions are confusing to him, and are in a way taking him on a spiritual journey, hence across the universe. i think the line 'nothing's gonna change my wolrd' means that even though he feels all these emotions strongly, they aren't making any sense, or that nothing is getting resolved. often while tripping you think very hard about problems or ideas you have, but more often then not you don't actually work them out or they dont make sense. it ssems like john is saying that he feels all of these things intensely, but that he still hasnt figured anything out in terms of what all these feelings mean\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_191": "\ni love this song\r\nits amazing :]\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_192": "\nI'm not gonna lie this song reminds me of a trip I had, hahaha great times!
