{"comment_0": "\nSeveral of Twenty One Pilots' songs have lyrics that COULD be interpreted as being Christian in nature, but this one is pretty obvious. It's a prayer. He's talking to God, the Father, at the end of another day. And the water is the \"living water\" of Christ. There's a lot of clever imagery in this song. For those of us Christians who are struggling to stay in relationship with Christ, it's very relatable.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song is a Christian Song. The water stands for God, The Holy Spirit, and Jesus. The sand is the world, or in greek \"Cosmos\". Basically he has Jesus an wants to walk with him and do his work but he trying to be in the world as well. Matthew 6:24 proves this. He needs his healing.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI know people think this song is all Christian meaning, but I am pretty much an Atheist. This does not mean that the true meaning is wrong, I agree, it's about Jesus or whatever, and that's awesome, but my personal interpretation reminds me of a son and father who are distant and the son writes this song to his dad explaining how they havent been talking and that he misses him and needs him and how he is struggling in life, and he needs his father's wisdom and support that he has little of, which reminds me of the part where the singer says \"I hold the water in the palm of my hand\" referring to his memories, wisdom, and support from his father. When the verse continues and the water is lost, i believe it means that his relationship with his father is basically ruined and that the son is alone with no water, which can represent a necessity of life, especially in the desert. And a son needs his father, so the water and the desert have a lot of meaning to me. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nTyler is writing about how he has been away from God for a long time at the beginning of the song. He hasn't talked to him for quite some time and he feels that without God he is missing some of the water of life.\r\nThe desert of his mind is a reflection of being lost without God in sin, and that is all in his head. The sin comes from him saying that he \"hasn't been the best\". \r\nThe remainder of the song is about Tyler trying to find just a drop of water, which is him trying to get back to God but he isn't reaching him.\r\nThe best way to explain the Christian view of this song occurs when he says \"You hear me screaming/Father/And I'm lying here just crying/So wash me with your water\". \r\nSimply a brilliant song, and great representation of finding God.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nHello\nWe haven't talked in quite some time\nI know\nI haven't been the best\nOf sons\n\nno quite sure about this first part.\n\nHello\nI've been traveling in\nThe desert of my mind\nAnd I\nHaven't found a drop\nOf life\nI haven't found a drop\nOf you\nI haven't found a drop\nOf water\n\nhe might be talking about how hes trying to search through his mind to find some meaning of himself, and trying to find some happy thoughts abut himself or someone he loves (a drop of you)\n\nI try desperately to run through the sand\nAs I hold the water\nIn the palm of my hand\nCause it's all that I have\nIt's all that I need and\n\nhe might be talking about im running through life, and getting stuck in problem desperately trying to keep the water (the things that matter to him) from spilling.\n\nThe waves of the water\nMean nothing to me\nBut I try my best\nAnd all that I can to\nHold tightly onto\nWhat's left in my hand\nBut no matter how\nHow tightly I will strain\nThe sand will slow me down\nAnd the water will drain\n\nhe might be talking about how as hard as he tries, he can never keep the water (the things that matter to him) safe, but he cant because the sand (problems in his life) is draging him down and he cant stop the water from draining so hes slowly losing everything.\n\nI'm just being dramatic\nIn fact,\nI'm only at it again\nAs an addict with a pen\nWho's addicted to the wind\nAs it blows me back and fourth\nMindless, spineless, and pretend\nOf course I'll be here again\nSee you tomorrow\nBut it's the end of today\nEnd of my ways\n\nhe might be talking about how hes just over reacting and hes just overthinking it all the time and hes just \"at it again\" - saying he writes about this stuff all the time and hes getting sick of himself doing that.\n\nAs a walking denial\nMy trial was filed as a crazy\nSuicidal head case\n\nhe might be talking about how hes in denial about his whatever he is talking about and every time he tries to talk about whatever it, people just call him a \"crazy suicidal head case\"\n\nBut you specialize in dying\nYou hear me screaming\nFather\nAnd I'm lying here just crying\nSo wash me with your water\n\nagain, not sure about this, there might be a religious meaning behind this,\n\nim not saying this is the actual meaning, these are just my thoughts\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\n\"Hello\r\nWe haven't talked in quite some time\r\nI know\r\nI haven't been the best\r\nOf sons\"\n\r\nHe is speaking to God, referring to himself as his son (as we are all God's children according to Christian belief). By saying he isn't the best of sons, he is saying that he hasn't been a good Christian and has had a strained relationship with God. It has been a while since he's prayed. \n\r\n\"Hello\r\nI've been traveling in\r\nThe desert of my mind\r\nAnd I\r\nHaven't found a drop\r\nOf life\r\nI haven't found a drop\r\nOf you\r\nI haven't found a drop\r\nI haven't found a drop\r\nOf water\"\n\r\nI believe that in this verse, he is stating that his belief in God has been weakening, and that a relationship with God is virtually nonexistent since when he searches his mind he cannot seem to locate any faith. \n\r\n\"I try desperately to run through the sand\r\nAs I hold the water\r\nIn the palm of my hand\r\nCause it's all that I have\r\nAnd it's all that I need and\r\nThe waves of the water\r\nMean nothing to me\r\nBut I try my best\r\nAnd all that I can to\r\nHold tightly onto\r\nWhat's left in my hand\r\nBut no matter how\r\nHow tightly I will strain\r\nThe sand will slow me down\r\nAnd the water will drain\"\n\r\n\"Water\" is holy, it's representing his faith here.

However, no matter how much he tries to hold on to his faith, the world will begin to \"drain\" it out of him until he has no faith left. \n\r\n\"I'm just being dramatic\r\nIn fact,\r\nI'm only at it again\r\nAs an addict with a pen\r\nWho's addicted to the wind\r\nAs it blows me back and forth\r\nMindless, spineless, and pretend\r\nOf course I'll be here again\r\nSee you tomorrow\r\nBut it's the end of today\r\nEnd of my ways\r\nAs a walking denial\r\nMy trial was filed as a crazy\r\nSuicidal head case\r\nBut you specialize in dying\r\nYou hear me screaming\r\nFather\r\nAnd I'm lying here just crying\r\nSo wash me with your water\"\n\r\nHe is saying that he is overreacting and that he just writes what he's thinking on the spot. The wind seems to represent the troubles in his life and he's trying to overcome them. He is stating that he will be praying again tomorrow, but that today he's going to to stop denying that he needs God. It appears that no one else is helping him and that he just been labeled \"crazy\" and \"suicidal\" by others. He is asking God to help him, he needs God in his life as he is struggling and asking to wash him with his water, which means saving him.\n\n\n", "comment_6": "\nAs a teenager sometimes life can suck right?

I feel like at least a few TOP songs are about struggling through life, which any one can do, religious or not. I feel like this song is about one of those struggles. Maybe he feels like no one is there for him. Or maybe he feels like he fucked up his own childhood, which made him and his family have a falling out, and he wants to reunite with them and make things better.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nI think this song is about love with a person which is about to end and the main character is trying his best to keep it alive. Basically the water in this song is love, he's holding that little of relationship and love in his hand not letting it die, and it's all that he needs, he doesn't need any other people and their feelings (the waves of the water mean nothing to me) and he realizes that no matter what he does it will end anyway. Sand is probably a metaphor of problems or something like that. And supposingly Tyler doesn't have a father, he just asks for his help support and love again which he was supposed to be taking whole his life.\r\nHowever the song might as well be about the God, or a father.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nAs someone who has struggled with faith and continues to struggle with it, this song is exactly what that is, a struggle with faith. Water has a very deep meaning in the bible. And he talks about it various times.\n\n\"I haven't found a drop of water.\" -- This is a reference to being spiritually thirsty. It's  when one is lacking love, motivation, meaning through God. \n\n\"Hold the water in my hand.\" -- Referring to God's word and love. Everything he needs to cure his spiritual thirstiness.\n\n\"So wash me with your water.\" -- A reference to baptism, a spiritual cleansing through God. Forgiveness.\n\nIn the end of the day this song is about the struggle of doubt. He is doubting God and wants bad to believe, but it is very hard for him. He keeps searching for the meaning through God, but hasn't found it. He screams out to God to save him, \"wash me with your water.\" But he still struggles with that doubt. This is a good song to accompany their song \"Doubt.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nfriendly reminder that just bc Ty is religious it doesn't mean all his songs are about \"god\" :^)\ni'm an atheist, and even i'll say that messages about \"god\" are implied in other songs and you can of course think of it however you want\nbut here's my interpretation: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about trying your best\nthe water represents the positive things/love you have in your life\nthe desert represents your mind, and the sand are your problems/negative things in your life (over thinking)\nyou are aware and accept that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to focus on the positive things\nit reminds me of how people are struggling with things and trying to focus on happiness, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a little bit,,,and like everyone's gonna feel like that at one point in their life\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nThis song is very much with a dual meaning.

His search has come up so short he can't even find a drop of water. \n\nI try desperately to run through the sand\nAs I hold the water in the palm of my hand\n'Cause it's all that I have and it's all that I need and\nThe waves of the water mean nothing to me\nBut I try my best and all that I can\nTo hold tightly onto what's left in my hand\nBut no matter how, how tightly I will strain\nThe sand will slow me down and the water will drain\n\nEventually tyler found a handful of water which is so important to him that he is fighting through the sand as desperately as he can. But like in real life eventually the sand will slow him down and the hope filled, and purposeful water in tylers hand will drain leaving him desperate and hopeless again.\n\nI'm just being dramatic, in fact, I'm only at it again\nAs an addict with a pen, who's addicted to the wind\nAs it blows me back and forth, mindless, spineless, and pretend\n\nTyler is telling God and trying to convince himself he is happy, he's just being dramatic. He's just being a writer who emphasizes everything and gains pity points with depression talk. But as this goes on he's not only addicted to dramatizing things he's addicted to the wind that blows him back and forth mindlessly and he acts spineless and blows with it. This is where he is fighting himself saying he's not suicidal or depressed, he's just following trend, following which ever way the wind (media and trends) blows. But the last word is pretend, which means he knows he's only pretending to be content.\n\nOf course I'll be here again, see you tomorrow, but it's the end of today\nEnd of my ways as a walking denial\nMy trial was filed as a crazy suicidal head case\n\nThis is where Tyler is telling God that he's going to change himself and it will be the end of his \"ways as a walking denial\". He's saying everyone passes him off as \"a crazy suicidal head case\". Basically saying God I'm going to fix myself if you help.\n\nBut you specialize in dying, you hear me screaming \"father\"\nAnd I'm lying here just crying, so wash me with your water\n\nHe says he's screaming father because he's god's child so obviously god is his father and tyler is just lying there crying for help from God. Remember before when the water was water of hope and purpose, when tyler asks God to wash him with his water, tyler is asking to receive hope and purpose from God.\n\nHello\nI haven't talked in quite some time\nI know\nI haven't been the best\nOf sons, hello, I've been traveling in the desert of my mind\nAnd I\nI haven't found a drop\nOf life\nI haven't found a drop\nOf you\nI haven't found a drop\nI haven't found a drop\nOf water\n\nThis is where Tyler is apologizing to God for not being a good son (tyler hasn't been talking/praying to God enough) And he's trying to search for hope and purpose without god and he's sorry for not trusting god. \n\nOk I'm DUN now.

There never was much of it, because of the falling out he had with him. \"The waves of the water\" is his relationship between his family, which is otherwise perfectly fine. His family is offering their help, which he is rejecting, too focused on his father. Now, his dad is dying. That's why the water is now draining. Tyler is trying to help him get better, so that's him running through the sand. His own father's life is slipping from his own grasp,and he's becoming frustrated about it.
