{"comment_0": "\nI'm quite surprised on how little some people know about Tool. The CD this song comes from was entirely dedicated to the late great Bill Hicks (R.I.P.), and some of the lyrics, this song specifically, are actually plays off rants that Bill Hicks had. Maynard (and Tool) and Bill Hicks were close friends. Bill Hicks had mentioned numerous times about how much he hates L.A. and just wants to flush the whole thing down, so people better start learning to swim or they will drowned in their own filth. And the \"see you down in Arizona Bay\" part, Bill Hicks had also said that too. So all in all, this song is pretty straight forward if you know of the legendary Bill Hicks.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI think this song follows a similar theme to that of many Tool songs - enlightenment. It seems it can be taken at face value and that the 'narrator' is just sick of everything that is wrong with L.A. Taken to a deeper level of meaning, however, and I think the song is about hope for better rather than worse. Here is what the song translates to, in my opinion of course;\n\r\nMost of the song is written from a negative perspective and in such a way that it really resonates with the disillusionment in many people. I think many people would derive a sick pleasure from watching the world collapse and to feel that their own misery is near an end, but i think the narrator sums it up perfectly when he says 'Don't just call me pessimist, try and read between the lines. I can't imagine why you wouldn't welcome any change, my friend.' To me this part implies that, although the narrator is speaking from a negative point of view, the desire is a positive one. \n\r\nAs with many of Tool's songs, Keenan suggests that by simply living in the here and now and by accepting each moment as the only thing that truly exists, one can be freed from the bonds of human existence and from a position in time (Parabola, perhaps?)in order to feel truly connected with the 'oneness' of consciousness. For most people, enlightenment is an esoteric concept rather than a freedom achievable with anyone who so strongly desires it. For those who do become enlightened, a large proportion had to suffer greatly in order for the transmutation to commence. Some became enlightened due to the death of a loved one, or through severe illness. In my case, I experienced a sudden flash of enlightened awareness after years of suffering from severe depression and anxiety. I am still practicing in order to get to that peaceful place again.\n\r\nTo me, the song seems to imply that the narrator hopes for a cataclysmic event to wake up those whose eyes are closed to the true and beautiful nature of existence.\n\r\nCheers.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThe 'learn to swim' part is a message for all Californians because maynards praying for it to sink into the ocean...if you notice in the in-lay of Tool's cd the 3-d picture, if you move it...only California dissappears.\n\r\n\"fret for your pilot\" hes talking about a television pilot..etc\n\r\nthis song is just one big fuck you to Los Angeles, the entertainment industry, and to all the narcissistic people in california.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nHey everyone!\r\nI just gotta say, by lookin past the surface of this song, or at least by tryin too, I get a lot more out of it. It goes past bein angry at how fake and superficial people and LA are. The word AEenma is a mixture of the word Enema, which is clearing of the bowels with fluid, and the word Anima, which is, in Jungian theory, the true inner subconscious self. It seems to me that this song is about clearing away those attachments to stupid useless shit that we don't need, and getting back to nature. He makes multiple references to mom, which is probably Mother Nature. Its about getting back to our true inner selves, uncovering what's hidden in our subconcious, and clearing away all of the shit, and learning how to swim.

This song is on the '96 album AEnima, a tribute to Bill Hicks, another dead hero, who passed in '94 (no doubt the song writing began soon after the 32 y/o died). The album title requires you ignore the \"E\" (so Anima translates \"life force\" or \"soul\"). \n\r\nThen with the album's title track, spelled AEnema, you are to ignore the \"A,\" you know, to start the detoxing process. Brilliant word smithing by MJK and the band! Bill Hicks in the afterlife is loving it!The song is simply about the famous phrase \"sink or swim.\" Or, to be more L.A. like, \"detox or die!\" \n\r\nIf you... Read Between The Lines (by the lines I mean \"Learn To Swim\"), you'll see the \"sink\" parts (things we fret for, things that make us followers) and the \"swim\" parts (things to say f-you to, ways to go left when everyone else is going right). \n\r\nIf this song were written today, I'm sure Tool would have mentioned another item to fret: The Mother-F-ing Cell Phone!!! I'm a math professor at a California college who recently went to open a classroom door at which my students were waiting. As I was walking toward the door, I noticed at least 80% of them with their heads down playing with their cell phones (themselves... metaphorically... if you consider F-Book). Sadly, behind them was one of the most spectacular sunsets I'd ever seen. I'm not sure any of my 40 students even noticed \"MOM's\" work. That says a lot if you think about it. \n\r\nAnd speaking of saying a lot, a certain magazine's person of the year is \"The PROTESTOR.\" If you really want to protest something worthwhile, \"Protest The Cell.\" If for no other reason, do it for the sake of humanity. \n\r\nWe're going to reap what we sow in 20-30 years when we start realizing the long term effects of carrying cell phones with their ever-increasing (4G, 8G, 16G, ...) electropollution (EMFs) being emitted 24-7 so near our collective reproductive organs. \n\r\n\"Learn To Swim\" well enough to make it to the \"Arizona Bay.\" \n\r\nTranslations? \n\r\nGet the cells away from the bells! This goes for us ladies too.\n\r\nGot EMF-ed? Ignore the EMF, and what do you get? \n\r\nIf you limp, you a wimp! \n\r\nIf you sink, we can't link! \n\r\nDon't treat your \"TOOL\" that way and you'll make it to the Arizona Bay! \n\r\nLearn to swim!\n\r\nOh, and don't forget about the little swimmers. I'm imagining headlines in 2030: All the franks are shooting blanks! No more eggs between the legs! \n\r\nFor the sake of humanity, to hell with the cell.

The chorus, is general, directly references the bit, where Hicks commented on Los Angeles' intense heat and shallow way of life, and jokingly mentioned how great it would be if southern California would break off from the rest of the United States and sink to the bottom of the ocean.

So what the narrator wants to see drown is all that bad shit most of us seem to strive for.\n\nAlso, to say \"fuck L. Ron Hubbard and fuck all his clones\" in 1996, living in LA, takes alot of guts. Today most people know Scientology is BS, and alot of people also know its an evil cult that does awful things to its members, but back then it was just as popular - if not more popular - with Hollywood (LA) celebrities but without the widespread awareness of how bad it is. In other words, if the English speaking world was a high school then Hollywood (LA) celebrities would be the Mean Girls type \"cool\" kids that you're supposed to suck up to, emulate, and fear. For some no-name metal band to call them out for being fake probably ruffled a few feathers.

Will it be tommorow or today? Who cares? We have lost focus of what life is. It isn't about what we own or who we are friends with. Life is about this moment, who we are inside and out, what we share with each other. I feel that Maynard paints a clear picture of how society has become a monster. We lost the whole meaning of life. We have become obssesed with money, sex, and power. Not about love for each other, the ability to understand someone else, to share the pain someone feels, to care about what we do. The morality has been lost and it's time we brought it back. I believe Maynard just used L.A. as an example. The whole U.S. is like it. The world is like it. To me the sweetest taste is the one of revival. A new and fresh start. It's like when you wash you face when you wake up. Cool and soothing. It hurts to see the insainty, to hear people hate so much. To know what people feel. And personally, seeing all this hate and lack of compassion make some want to have faith in something more powerful than us. Because that is what it would take to make things right again. Put aside our petty wants, and feel for a change. Money, drugs, meaningless sex, it is all false realities. Something to hold you in one place. Think outside the box. Think outside of your body and trust in your spirit. Allow your soul to join with others and celebrate life. But many don't see it, they just want to be laid, intoxicated, famous, and rich. Money is a object, not a person. Why love it. Why put aside you awareness to feel helpless? Why share yourself with someone you don't care about? Why waste your life worring about what people think of you, and not focus on what you think about you. Be who you are, your better that way.

The inspiration for this song comes from the comedian Bill Hicks who, on his \"Arizona Bay\" CD, described how he wished California would sink into the ocean.

And I guess the fact that spineless whores like Bob Saget are given airtime, while Hicks were labeled too controversial at the time, angered him. It's pretty much the same thing in music; spineless manufactured assholes like N'sync and Britney get attention and airtime, whereas music that requires something from the listener or doesn't mention \"baby\" or \"love\" twenty times per song gets less attention. If we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re too afraid to speak our opinion or offend and alienate possible customers, then what is the purpose of creating art? TOOL, like Hicks; is something for those of us who want something more than just empty clich\u00c3\u00a9s and streamlined art. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see N\u00e2\u0080\u0099sync address their own emotional problems inherited from paternal abuse (H). Guess not, more songs about cheesy teenage-love then. \n\r\nMaynard is among many artists who enjoy Hicks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 material, others include Kyuss and Radiohead. I once read that Maynard cited a Hicks album as one of his five tourbus choices. Hicks is pictured inside the \u00c3\u0086nema cover and provides the \u00e2\u0080\u009creal fuckin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 high on drugs\u00e2\u0080\u009d. On some versions of \u00c3\u0086nema, California is missing from the US map. \n\r\nAnd finally; I might be wrong, the distance from Norway to California is rather big both in ways of thinking and in space.

My interpretation of this song is obviously the end of the world.  It's all about how civilization of the world is completely fucking up the world spiritually, and physically.

Some are also by a man named Hal Lyndsey who is a doomsayer and has many books which originated in the early 70's (The Late Great Planet Earth).  Most of the revlations of doomsayers are that a piece of California will split around the San Andreas fault and eventually drift off into the Pacific Ocean and possibly sink.  Sending all of the people of the work into disbelief.  When Manyard talks about Mom's Going to fix it all soon, he means Mother Earth, or mother nature.  Mother Nature always wins in the end. When He says \"Fuck........\" when all of this shit like Armageddon comes around, actress, material possessions and mainly money doesn't mean shit when your running from the end of the world, because there is onle one judge in the very end.

In the Salival Master cd there is a skit where supposedly Maynard calls the LAMT(?) i think and is filling out a touch tone survey about proposition 187 which [i think] prevents immigrants who come into California from having the same rights as regular citizens of the U.S. Well anyways I found this out by searching for lyrics to songs on the Salival Master. In parentheses at the bottom for the lyrics to this \"skit\" it explains the whole thing about Prop. 187 and what it's all about.

I've been to LA several times now, so I can definitely say I agree with Maynard wholeheartedly.  Maynard actually wrote this song after a concert in LA at L. Ron Hubbards scientology convention center in 1995.  He was so disgusted by the philosophy that came from these dispicable excuses for human beings' mouths that it sparked him to write a tribute to them and their lovely city.  If you refer to my comment in the 46 & 2 section, you can see how Aenima is the most appropriate name for this song.  The flushing away of this arrogant populous and their incredulously stated ideologies is a wish on Maynard's part...not a foreshadowing of events such as the apocalypse, etc.  And quite an appropriate wish it is.  The root of the song is getting at the evolution of thought once again.  He refers to \"mom\", short for mother-nature, several times in the song, metaphorically sweeping away the ignorance and arrogance situated in LA.  The reference to swimming (\"Learn to Swim\") is drilled into the listeners head.  It is a chant saying, you better learn to swim (learn to think and live on your own) or you will drown in a pool of sheepish conformity which will swallow you and the rest of the adultared masses festering in the neon distraction which we call American Capitalism.  He cleverly calls this body of water Arizona Bay, because when Southern Califoria is covered in water, that is exactly what it will have become. And if any of you noticed, the first thing Maynard lists to \"Fuck\" is L. Ron Hubbard and all of his clones...coincidence, I think not.  I love his reference to \"Fuck smiley glad-hands with hidden agendas\" because I believe this to be the biggest problem with American culture and human nature--the deceptive nature of man with his alterior motives.  Maynard knows that nature and all of nature's creatures, except for humans, are honest in their endevours, mainly because they have no other choice except to be that way.  We humans have the conscious choice to be faithful, pure, and true to our fellow man, yet we choose greed and betrayal to satisfy our own tawdry, selfish needs.  I believe Maynard's evolution of thought includes the selfless recognition of all men and trust that must be harnessed between them.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_119": "\nguys, Maynard fits alot of different meanings into his songs so that everyone can enjoy it in their own way, it is true genius the amount of meanings you can get out of his songs, But i saw a quote from him, saying that the song is about the human race learning to swim in the pool of collective unconciousness, where we are all one, as you might see he talks about this in other songs, Eg Reflection, where he says \"And you will come to find that we are all one mind\r\nCapable of all thats imagined and conceivable\r\n\" as well as this he is also saying what all of you are saying about holiwood, where he thinks that the physical, mental and environmental polution there is pulling us further and further away from this goal to realise that we are all of one collective conciousness, and like someone else said, it is also about evolving, past the phsycal, like in forty six and 2. well thats my 2 cents\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_120": "\nTo comment on adamizer's comment (up a bit).

The way that instead of being the supposed God's almighty wrath of terror, the hollywood perception is that it's all special FX, and everythings big and blown up, you know: tidal waves and fault lines, etc... So Maynard's saying, if that's the case, I want to see it all crumble then, just like a movie.\n\r\nThis Apocolyptic side of the song may be linked the views of L. Ron Hubbard who is mentioned aswell... he was the founder of scientology which is basically a religion purely based on money. Go and see the movie \"Battlefield Earth\", that was based on an L.

So I guess it could be interpreted as being about the cleansing of the soul.  When he says \"fuck...\" everything, he is indeed expressing his annoyance and frustration with society's (particularly the artificiality, showbusiness society of Los Angeles) focus on the material and all of the fakeness--like The Church of Scientology (\"fuck L. Ron Hubbard and fuck all his clones\"), which ought to be called the Cult of Celebrity; the degrading of hip-hop culture (\"fuck all you gun-toting hip gangster wannabes\"), fads (\"fuck retro anything, fuck your tattoos\"), excess in drugs, etc. that often goes on in Hollywood lifestyles, as well as the fickleness (\"fuck all you junkies and fuck your short memory), the corruption and deception of folks in the business (\"fuck smiley glad-hands with hidden agendas\"), and the emotional pretentiousness of materialistic showbiz people who have all these screwed-up problems and run around crying about it (\"fuck these dysfucntional, insecure actresses\").

I don'r know if this has been discussed as of yet but I find Maynard's hate of L Ron Hubbard interesting. For those of you who do not know who Hubbard is, he is one of the main supporters of Scientology, a sort of quasi-religion that has gained support over the years. The main belief of Scientology is that man can shift the way that he feels, thinks, and looks at life, simply by opening and using the mind to see the true picture. Over time this belief has picked up and many famous people such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta have become dedicated \"Scientologists.\" In many ways, it could be said that this belief has indeed created many followers and \"clones\" if you will, and that those who follow the beliefs are blinded and controlled from the normal and beneficial aspects of life. I have just started reading a book by Hubbard on Scientology out of interest, and have found that Hubbard is really nothing more than a tele-evangelist in print. Despite the fact that many ideas of Scientology do seem pretty well-rounded and idealistic, much of it still in my beliefs, seems to not allow the individual to think for himself, and is more of a way to let only the brain do the feeling, thinking, learning, and seeing for you. I think that what Maynard is saying in the context of the song is that when the end of the world does come, none of this trying to see the light in life bullshit is going to matter. In the end, no matter how optimistic, or how controlled and open-minded the individual is, his end will come just like everyone else's. Therefore, Hubbard and his army of Scientologist brain thinkers, will meet their end, even though their \"religion\" tells them to not believe so. Maynard is expressing his own beliefs that the worlds and divinities and auditing that the people of the world create is nothing more than a way of blinding one's self from the truth, and creating a fake screen from what one may call inevitability. So in the end, L Ron Hubbard and all of his clones mean nothing, because even though they will refuse to see so, they truly will be f*****d just like everything else that really isn't important.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_173": "\nSTOP! collecting material possesions...they do you no good when \"a comet will fall from the sky, Followed by meteor showers and tidal waves, Followed by faultlines that cannot sit still.\" and \"Fuck L.

I am trying not to add shit that is already on here so here goes.  \n\r\nLEARN TO SWIM in relation to religion seems to be more scientific.  Christians are always concerned about \"Blind Faith\" and walking on water. (Walking on water is a sign of purity to Christians if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already know)  Why worry about doing something that I have never seen someone do when I know I can learn to swim?  Swimming is possible to keep the head afloat, Christians wont get to far if they never learned how to swim and there is another flood.  But I guess God says in the bible that he will never have a flood again.  So if you believe that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to know how to swim I guess. \n\r\nAnother metaphorical idea can be applied to what I just wrote above.  Learning to swim, to me, is dealing with problems on earth.  Dealing with problems here, now, and in front of us.  The sin of masturbation or the sin of gluttony in the world does not concern me; I am more concerned about the macrocosmic picture.  Now that I am dealing with real life problems in front of me I know how to swim.  \n\r\nAnother thing I see in the LEARN TO SWIM quote is its solid character.  When someone gets me with his or her whit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s I may be resilient and jump back with my own whit.  Most Christians that I know crumble at simple whit (cry/insecure over me calling them a stupid head ..lol.. for example) and fall against great whit.  Who is there to break their fall?  Ahh yes church, their dependence.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_183": "\nside7.fullburner.com/ross/images/fullsize/art/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_184": "\nIt's the song that comes into my head whenever some asshole with a California license plate cuts me off.

That's what I thought when I first heard it, I mean the song talks about the end of the world a lot, and the \"Mom\" character is the one who will \"flush it all away\" or end the earth. If you know anything about religion (no I'm not religious), God is the one who will come and flush it all away, put it back the way it oughta be. Mom will come soon, there isn't much worth keeping and you can't change it without destroying it all. Maynard says that the people, and the way things are in the world, or LA, cannot be changed, the only way to fix it is to flush it all away. And the way things are NEEDS to be changed, it couldn't really be any worse: \"I don't know why you wouldn't welcome any change\". \n\r\nThe \"fret for your \" shows how people focus on the small, worthless things that only affect them. Things that comfort them but aren't important.\n\r\nThe \"Fuck L. Ron Hubbard and Fuck all his clones Fuck all those gun-toting Hip gangster wannabes Fuck retro anything Fuck your tattoos Fuck all you junkies and Fuck your short memory Fuck smiley glad-hands With hidden agendas Fuck these dysfunctional, Insecure actresses\" pretty much goes along the same line as the fretting part in that people are too concerned with little unimportant things about themselves, in this part he focuses more on the stupid shit we do to make ourselves \"popular\" and worrying about how we look in other people's eyes. Narcissists.\n\r\nGreat song, important meaning.

Hicks and the band were good friends, with Hicks even opening for the band on one of their tours.  His last album was entitled Arizona Bay, and was hilarious, by the way.  Many of you failed to notice the definition of the word enema and the meaning which goes along with that, which im sure you can establish yourselves.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_188": "\nWell.\r\nThink about it.\r\nAenima  or \"Anima\" is from the Jungian theory. As we all know, the Jungian theory is about the Evolution of Humans, and Anima is the shadow around you representing things you hate. \r\nIn the song Aenima he talks about LA and how it should be flushed away. Think about it, LA is one big city full of millions of people who do absolutely nothing to help us advance to the third grid of the Jungian theory. These people are like parasites to him and have no use in life. If they arent helping us move forward, they're pulling us back. Maynard thinks they should fall into the Pacific from some freak earthquake. Maynard tells us how people fret for little things in life when he starts the \"Fret for your\" part. He's simply saying how all this stuff is not important in our lives and it only makes us feel better. He is stating all the \"dumbasses\" like smiley glad hands who act like they are your friend, but have hidden agendas to steal your life. Why should LA exist if it's so bad and does nothing for us to move on to the 3rd grid? LA is basically a waste in Maynards eyes. And I completely agree. Also, California should be flushed away to destroy it all. If you destroy it all, you can start over. Arizona bay is what will come once California again. Look on a US map. If you took California away there would be a bay right by Arizona.

We began with no language, as things thinking for themselves, but as we 'evolved,' we only got stupider. Our organized religions are pretty much communist ideals, saying if you're not the same as us then you're screwed over and condemned. A majority of humans lack the ability to think for themselves, blindly following others. And, just like the excellent song \"Dust in the Wind\" by Kansas, I think that Maynard is trying to say that no matter what, if the world continues forever, eventually it's bound to crumble and everything everyone strives for now will have been useless and in vain.

What you guys are saying is like saying H. is about a snake that drowns. \n\r\nThe theme of the CD is evolution. The most significant song expressing this theme is Forty Six & 2, about the Jungian theory. Jungian theory states there are 3 stages of evolution, and that we are aparantley in the 2nd stage, with 44 chromosomes, and 2 sex chromosomes. Our next stage would be 46 and 2, the 3rd stage. But in order to reach this 3rd we have to clean our conciousness. We have to get rid of everything that we dont like or hate. This is called Anima.\n\r\nThe title of the song and cd is Aenema, a combination of Enema and Anima. Enema being a clensing, anima being our conciousness. This song is describing what their clensing, or what their Aenema would be. In order for them to step through the whole state of California would have to disapear. The meaning of the song, I will admit, is very vauge, and is more than likely based off of the Bill Hicks bit, but the actual point of the song is deeper than what you guys have been saying. \n\r\nNo it is not just about drowning california, no it is not just about the Bill Hicks bit, and no it is not just about a spiritual clensing.

People are spending so much time caring about all that crap that they can't take care of themselves (i.e. they don't know how \"to swim\").  Think about it.  If your grocery store suddenly had no food on the shelves, your plumbing stopped delivering freshwater on demand, or the local utility stopped providing heat & gas at the flip of a switch, how many of us know what we need to survive?  Very few of us have \"learned to swim\"... we need the lifeboat.  We are \"dumbfounded dipshits\" who don't remember (\"Fuck your short memory\") how unstable the world really is, because we'd rather hear about Brad & Jen than actually pick up a history book.\n\r\nI'm not saying everyone should go be farmers, but our laziness has so progressed that instead of learning how to take care of ourselves, then going to learn a profession, we now skip over the take care of ourselves part and plug right into whatever position in the societal machine that will give us the most money, sex, quick-fix happiness, whatever.  And the free time we do have we waste on \"One great big festering neon distraction\" (television, media in general, and I'd throw wars in here).\n\r\nIndependence (ability to provide for oneself) is a positive value to the author, but one that doesn't get respect.

He just wants to see things go back the way they were, and for people to stop fretting over stupid shit. Not just LA, of course. But LA is definitely the posterchild for silly shit.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_235": "\nI believe Maynard was using a cataclysmic armegeddon to paint a picture about the cleansing of the inner man. Many of the songs on this album deals with spiritual endeavours and conflicts within oneself. Maynard isn't a revolutionist, he never really took to promoting purification on a world scale. Most of his work speaks of battles with oneself.\n\r\nCarl Jung explored most deeply into the realm of the anima, which is a symbolic archetype of the inner soul. I don't think this song is named what is it is for no reason. I agree with those who say that it's a form of wordplay, formed from both anima(soul) and enema(cleansing). The cleansing of the soul in other words. And I don't think it's coincidence either that the album was named Aenema. If it were so, that idea is most central, it has to epitomize the whole theme of the album.\n\r\nCarl Jung also studied the link between psychology and mythology extensively. He identified certain similarities in forms of mythology, of which come forth the Hero, who represents the conscious mind, and the Earth Mother, the unconscious. He wrote about the cycle of life, whereby the Hero frees himself from his Mother, and towards the later stage of his life, is returned to her. And owing to the Mother's persistent ability to identify and test the Hero's weaknesses, it highlights the magnitude of power the human unconscious has, something that obviously intrigues and facinates both Jung and Maynard.\n\r\nThere's a reason why the band identifies its fans as 'The Collective Consciousness'. It's a term coined by Carl Jung, which leads me to believe that Jung and his existential theories on the human mind are one of the biggest influences on Maynard's writing, and also reason to believe that this song is not just about catastrophe and the purging of the evil of the world. Besides, we're talking about Tool here man...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_236": "\nThere is something that is called Convergent boundaries.

Have any of you even bothered looking at the Tool website? Toolband.com . Tool isnt some ordinary pussy punk rock band like all of you like to think. It doesnt matter what song it is, all of their songs have a deeper meaning than what you think. What you guys are saying is like saying H. is about a snake that drowns.\n\r\nThe theme of the CD is evolution. The most significant song expressing this theme is Forty Six & 2, about the Jungian theory. Jungian theory states there are 3 stages of evolution, and that we are aparantley in the 2nd stage, with 44 chromosomes, and 2 sex chromosomes. Our next stage would be 46 and 2, the 3rd stage. But in order to reach this 3rd we have to clean our conciousness. We have to get rid of everything that we dont like or hate. This is called Anima.\n\r\nThe title of the song and cd is Aenema, a combination of Enema and Anima. Enema being a clensing, anima being our conciousness. This song is describing what their clensing, or what their Aenema would be. In order for them to step through the whole state of California would have to disapear. The meaning of the song, I will admit, is very vauge, and is more than likely based off of the Bill Hicks bit, but the actual point of the song is deeper than what you guys have been saying.\n\r\nNo it is not just about drowning california, no it is not just about the Bill Hicks bit, and no it is not just about a spiritual clensing. Its probably the most personal song that Tool has ever made, and for that reason it threw most people off. It has to do with all of these things that you guys said, they all fit together, but you guys would rather conflict with each other to think that your the only right ones. I highly agree with Squirlleofdoom and World Ofrobots on this one.\n\r\nSo, there we go, are we clear. \n\r\nWhat Brabbrabus said is one example of the big picture. most you guys are right but it has more then one meaning and Brabbrabus just showed us this.

I'm sorry, I just don't see any hint of a \"deeper meaning\"; usually songs with hidden message have clues in them that have been left by the songwriter. There's no hint of it; its a pretty straight forward song: the guy hates the world, especially LA. \n\r\nIf someone could explain to me, in detail, the \"deeper meaning\" that this \"genius\" is trying to get at then I'd be delighted.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_273": "\nFirst off tool is one of the best bands of our generation period \r\nmusically almost no one compares to them \r\nbut this song is about how LA is just a horrible place to be and exist and all maynard wants it is to fall away in2 nothing\r\nhe says its not entirely impossible either all we have to do is read between the lines and we will see wats going to happen\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_274": "\n\"I just gotta say, by lookin past the surface of this song, or at least by tryin too, I get a lot more out of it. It goes past bein angry at how fake and superficial people and LA are. The word AEenma is a mixture of the word Enema, which is clearing of the bowels with fluid, and the word Anima, which is, in Jungian theory, the true inner subconscious self. It seems to me that this song is about clearing away those attachments to stupid useless shit that we don't need, and getting back to nature. He makes multiple references to mom, which is probably Mother Nature. Its about getting back to our true inner selves, uncovering what's hidden in our subconcious, and clearing away all of the shit, and learning how to swim. LEARN TO SWIM,\"\n\r\nSummed up very well. I consider it to be the correct interpretation of the song. I, however, do not agree with the philosophy of \"finding your inner selves\" because it follows the \"truth is outward\" maxim, except it has been inverted. The problem I have with this philosophy is that it presupposes a whole slew of things that I do not agree with for find plausible (namely, the notion that every person has a \"true self\"). The reason I do not believe this is because I believe if a person wants to know themselves they have to do so by taking a genealogical approach,i.e. taking the historicity of their 'self' into consideration. This is essential to understand who you are and what forces have shaped you as a person. When I say \"forces\" I mean environmental forces which I use in a very loose sense for they entail a diverse array of forces that wholistically form an incredibly dynamic environmental force. In other words, a framework with numerous variables contained within it. What are these variables? Societal forces, psychological, genetical, etc... What is important is to remember that these are all inextricably intertwined. \n\r\nSo following this train of thought, how can there actually be a \"true self\"? There is not such thing (in my opinion). It's pure mythology. There is only the biological self, what you have experienced and how you have (and are going to) interpret those experiences. What I am really trying to get at is, you are whoever the fuck you want to be.The forces which have shaped you as a person are there within yourself. The task, I believe, now is to identify those \"forces that have shaped you\", proceed to trace their historical path as best as possible  (obviously, memories aren't perfect) and then recognize them (for what they are, whatever they may be). This process, however, must not be mistaken with the \"true self buried within\" notion. throughout \n\r\nSo you are who you are right now, but that does not mean that you will be this person 20 years from now. \n\r\nThe reason for this long post is an attempt to spark discussion amongst, what seems to me, an intelligent community of Tool fans.  I believe in people educating each other. It's healthy, it's fun, it's democratic.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_275": "\n\"I, however, do not agree with the philosophy of \"finding your inner selves\" because it follows the \"truth is outward\" maxim, except it has been inverted.\"\n\r\nCorrection: not \"truth is outward\" but \"truth is out there\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_276": "\nrealitymark is the only person to have relaised that Tool are massive fans of the late Bill Hicks. The comic genius is referred to in many of their songs, and even and extract of one of his shows is used as an intro (where he talks about how drugs shouldn't be banned, and those who say that hate all drug related things should throw away all their music, cos the artists were really f*cking high on drugs, and judging from the Tool videos, these guys aren't too unfamiliar with drugs either!) Bill Hicks lived in LA (or Hell-A), and hated it. He wanted it to fall into the ocean to leave something he calls Arizona Bay, hence the whole basis for this song. There may be hidden meanings behind this song, but the obvious one is the formentioned.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_277": "\ni love this song..its so complex..like all tool songs\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_278": "\nTool are a completely amazing band both lyric and and musicwise.Their music constantly continues to inspire and provoke new thoughts and ideas in both thier old and new fans [ and i also hear they're releasing a new album later this year woohoo!].  i find aenima really interesting [ it also happens to be a completely awesome song ]  No one can dispute the fact that the song centres around Maynard's loathing of L.A and how fake the place and it's celebrities are and him wishing the whole place and all the superficial 'stupid shit' that goes with it, would just dissapear. however i think thier is more to this song than just simply that. \r\nthe whole 'fret for' verse talks about all the things these celebreties are consumed by,  and if your honest you'll probably find something in that list that consumes you too, the fact is it's almost become human nature, a whole generation of materialistic and superficial worriers, because its what we're plasted with 24/7 from the media. this leads on to the lyrics 'learn to swim' which i interperate as -learn to get back to what really matters get back to the gene pool and our real human nature, learn to make it on your own with out all this stupid materialistic unnecessary shit are lives seem to be filled with. \r\n The 'Mom's gonna fix it all soon' part of the song is great the whole song seems to change like songs do when they point out a slight double meaning or irony i think maynard's main meaning is probably that whatever you believe to be a divine force whether it be a god or mother nature is 'gonna fix it all soon' on some sort of day of judgement it's a kind of ' you'll see' or ' i told you so moment' almost like a kid; [which i think this has a connection with my next point] but however far away from maynard's orginal idea as it probably is i like to stick to my original thought that the irony and second part to the double meaning is that he is pointing out his, [maybe] own childlike  weakness; he's as stuck as the rest and is at a loss as to how to fix the world and deep down longs for his'mom' god or whatever to save him and sort it all out becuase he finds it all too much to cope with. i find this part quite funny in a way cos i think it shows that he has the ability to luagh at himself and as he does this, he also has one up on all these dysnfunctional celebrities, despite his weaknesses.  and as he says at the end of the song don't just call me pessimist try and read between the lines , he urges everyone else to stop being so intense and be able to realise where they're going wrong and stop being so quick to call tool's songs dire and pessimistic understand that he wants to change society for the better. i think the mom thing and him admitting to his weaknesses is shown further in the 'i can't imagine why you wouldn't welcome any change..My friend' here he's saying i'm not judging you i'm relating with you, the difference is i see the way society is and know it isn't right , i won't be complacent becuase i know this needs to change, and surely you see it too so for god's sake lets stop judging and placing blame and admit our problems get back to what really matters. i also think the 3 ring circus sideshow of freaks could be a metaphor for the vicious circle we adesperately need to escape from and  get are buts down to arizona bay lol or find peace of mind - and what,  in the real scheme of things matter. he want's us all to think about this, he doesn't belive we can change L.A and and what modern society has become alone, but he does think we should be able to recognise are problems and admit we need to change, only then will we see the fake  hate breeding and bullshit society we have made disapear and i completely agree, we need to flush away the unimportant 'shit' [enema imagery ] that consumes us and the society  that makes us so unhappy. i really can't ellaborate on this anymore one cos it's too long allready two cos im real tired and  3 becuase i've run dry of ideas. i'm probably wong and reading into things to much lol but i'd like to know what others think about it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_279": "\nshit it's long lol. god once i start i just don't know when to shut it do?! if anyone does attempt to read it i'd really appreciate some feed back. thanks if u do read it . sorry its long. oops\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_280": "\nOkay, I don't think anyone has said this yet, but \"anima\" is the Jungian term for the female side of a man's psychology; it is considered to be the depths of a man's true wisdom, just as the \"animus\" is to a woman. Therefore, an aspect of this song is wishing for the release of the anima wisdom--for \"mom\" to fix this world. Also, as many others have said, there is much anger towards the world in this song, no matter how you want to word it. The line \"learn to swim\" could also be interpreted to mean that one should learn to navigate the depths of their psyche, which is where the anima comes from...I believe \"anima\" is used here because this is a very patriarchal society.

He doesn't accually want\r\neveryone to learn to swim of course, by that he means people should learn to\r\nopen their eyes and start thinking for themselves.  Stop being one of the\r\nparasites that frequent L.A.\n\r\nAs for the \"mom's gonna fix it all soon\" part, i'm not sure what that means.  I think the guy a few posts above me is onto something, maybe it's about how Maynard feels helpless, like a child perhaps, because he sees no way to fix the problem.  That seems the best explanation for that.\n\r\n\"Don't just call me pessimist\r\nTry and read between the lines \"\n\r\nThose lines could mean not to call him a pessimist because he thinks everyone in L.A. is a dipshit, and to read between the lines and realize that when he says L.A. he was being metaphorical.  But i don't think so, it seems to simple an explanation.  I'm not really sure what these lines mean.\n\r\nAs for the \"i cannot imagine why you would not welcome any change\", maybe that means Maynard cannot imagine why the residents of L.A. would not welcome any change, because of how bad it is right now.  He cannot imagine why they do not \"learn to swim\", or support flushing it all away.  Something like that.\n\r\nSo, basically this song is about all the stupid human parasites that clog up our society, and how Maynard wants to flush them all away.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_292": "\nThis song has to do with how the sinners in LA are bringing forth the same thing that happened to Atlantis.

Another aspect is people think that 'mommy' is going to fix everything for you, he's telling you that if you don't want to die, do something about it. Flushing them all away, the ocean will do that when the state sinks below the waterline. He then tells you that if you were smart you'd be learning how to swim so atleast then you'll have a better chance at surviving.

Anyway the correlation between the two is that since people are thinking about the end, it means that they are getting ready for it, and if people are ready for it then theirs a much better result for the outcome, and since there are people in the world that are ready, they can share their readiness through the unconscious as well as the conscious when the time comes. And having that god loves us it goes right along that he'd want us to do well.\r\n\"I certainly hope we will\", the way I see it is that he hopes that the outcome of armageddon is that we \"will\" ourselves, or in other words our future is based on our collective will.\r\n\"I sure could use a vacation from this\", I believe means that our end of the world will be in our \"will\" for what types of vacations (dreams) we wish to go on together and then come back to this \"base\" world to commune further in our heaven... this is my ideal for heaven; a world of Love, Peace and prosperity where we enjoy each others company and communion as well as, as a sort of collective, go on dreams with friends that spark our passion or some such and then come back to this base world of heaven and share our memories and our selves in a serene atmosphere.\n\r\nBULLSHIT THREE RING CIRCUS SIDESHOW OF\r\nFREAKS\n\r\nI think he's just saying that he thinks that the people before the end of the world are all freaks because there is nothing to hold any one group of heresayers together from another group, so theirfore they're all freaks to each other. Or at least it can be seen this way to some people. An further perhaps \"three ring\" has some innate symbology from god that refers to the God Head, or the Trinity.

ANY FUCKING DAY.\r\nLEARN TO SWIM, I'LL SEE YOU DOWN IN ARIZONA BAY.\n\r\nIn my eyes this says the following; first of all \"LA\" stands for \"Loving Ascension\", and then from the start... \"Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA\" means to me that the people of \"Loving Ascension\" have no hope, or hardly any hope (ie. hope*less*), because they have such adamant spiritual feelings or the such. \"fucking hole\" I believe refers to those that are in the \"unknown\", compared with other people, (the hole, or black hole if you will) and having the adamant spiritual feelings of Love that they have they are in bliss and are also in LA, \"Loving Ascension\", without any feelings of unneeded hope, or with the mindsets of not using hope as part of their being.\r\nFurther one of the meanings of \"flush\" is thus; \"The period of greatest prosperity or productivity\" (as can be seen if you search for \"prosperity\" with your find tool on the \"dictionary.com search result for flush\".\r\nArizona Bay = [Ar]=Air (The Openness), [i]=Self, [zon]=Zone, [a]=A, [B]=Being, [ay]=Ascension (and further from my understanding of the propensities of the alphabet, the 'y' means \"what self?\" ---- so \"Arizona Bay\" means in my eyes: \"The openness of the self zone, of ascension for the Being of Ascending What Self?\" -- and to \"Learn to Swim\" makes it so your breathing air and seeing the possibilities instead of below the water where you'll be stuck in the cycle of birth and death and re-birth and in a sense unconscious, much like an animal.\n\r\nFRET FOR YOUR FIGURE AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR LATTE AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR HAIRPIECE AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR LAWSUIT AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR PROZAC AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR PILOT AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR CONTRACT AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR CAR.\n\r\nWhy to fret for the following (first lets look at fret, the most powerful understanding I can gather is that of what's on stringed instruments such as guitars, that of the small metal bars across the fingerboard and when the string is stopped by a finger at the metal bar it will produce a note of the desired pitch... so all this fretting that \"Maynard - The vocals to the band tool that made this song\" is reffering to here is just asking you to make the desired pitch of tone for all the following; [figure] your body and how you want to look, [latte] your taste and what you'd like to do in your spare time (is what I think it's referring to, because eating is much of what we do in our spare time in the current reality... and also the tastes that we have for fun and the like), [hairpiece] don't forget the finer details!, [lawsuit] what sort of makeup do we want of the new world?-what universal laws?, [prozac] How do we want to show our sympathy?, [pilot] what do we want our heart(s} to made up of-our sort of innerpilot?, [contract] What sort of stories do we wish to !dive! into?, [car] and from former \"!dive!\", how do we want to transition into the stories?\n\r\nIT'S A\r\nBULLSHIT THREE RING CIRCUS SIDESHOW OF\r\nFREAKS\n\r\nI think he's saying it again, to let us think about the people that didn't make it, and what sort of levels of differences and similarities we want in each of our \"heavens'\"\n\r\nHERE IN THIS HOPELESS FUCKING HOLE WE CALL LA\r\nTHE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT IS TO FLUSH IT ALL AWAY.\r\nANY FUCKING TIME.

Anyway the correlation between the two is that since people are thinking about the end, it means that they are getting ready for it, and if people are ready for it then theirs a much better result for the outcome, and since there are people in the world that are ready, they can share their readiness through the unconscious as well as the conscious when the time comes. And having that god loves us it goes right along that he'd want us to do well.\r\n\"I certainly hope we will\", the way I see it is that he hopes that the outcome of armageddon is that we \"will\" ourselves, or in other words our future is based on our collective will.\r\n\"I sure could use a vacation from this\", I believe means that our end of the world will be in our \"will\" for what types of vacations (dreams) we wish to go on together and then come back to this \"base\" world to commune further in our heaven... this is my ideal for heaven; a world of Love, Peace and prosperity where we enjoy each others company and communion as well as, as a sort of collective, go on dreams with friends that spark our passion or some such and then come back to this base world of heaven and share our memories and our selves in a serene atmosphere.\n\r\nBULLSHIT THREE RING CIRCUS SIDESHOW OF\r\nFREAKS\n\r\nI think he's just saying that he thinks that the people before the end of the world are all freaks because there is nothing to hold any one group of heresayers together from another group, so theirfore they're all freaks to each other. Or at least it can be seen this way to some people. An further perhaps \"three ring\" has some innate symbology from god that refers to the God Head, or the Trinity. And perhaps he thinks its bullshit because it is like a mixed up circus instead of a serene unity.\n\r\nHERE IN THIS HOPELESS FUCKING HOLE WE CALL LA\r\nTHE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT IS TO FLUSH IT ALL AWAY.\r\nANY FUCKING TIME. ANY FUCKING DAY.\r\nLEARN TO SWIM, I'LL SEE YOU DOWN IN ARIZONA BAY.\n\r\nIn my eyes this says the following; first of all \"LA\" stands for \"Loving Ascension\", and then from the start... \"Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA\" means to me that the people of \"Loving Ascension\" have no hope, or hardly any hope (ie. hope*less*), because they have such adamant spiritual feelings or the such. \"fucking hole\" I believe refers to those that are in the \"unknown\", compared with other people, (the hole, or black hole if you will) and having the adamant spiritual feelings of Love that they have they are in bliss and are also in LA, \"Loving Ascension\", without any feelings of unneeded hope, or with the mindsets of not using hope as part of their being.\r\nFurther one of the meanings of \"flush\" is thus; \"The period of greatest prosperity or productivity\" (as can be seen if you search for \"prosperity\" with your find tool on the \"dictionary.com search result for flush\".\r\nArizona Bay = [Ar]=Air (The Openness), [i]=Self, [zon]=Zone, [a]=A, [B]=Being, [ay]=Ascension (and further from my understanding of the propensities of the alphabet, the 'y' means \"what self?\" ---- so \"Arizona Bay\" means in my eyes: \"The openness of the self zone, of ascension for the Being of Ascending What Self?\" -- and to \"Learn to Swim\" makes it so your breathing air and seeing the possibilities instead of below the water where you'll be stuck in the cycle of birth and death and re-birth and in a sense unconscious, much like an animal.\n\r\nFRET FOR YOUR FIGURE AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR LATTE AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR HAIRPIECE AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR LAWSUIT AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR PROZAC AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR PILOT AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR CONTRACT AND\r\nFRET FOR YOUR CAR.\n\r\nWhy to fret for the following (first lets look at fret, the most powerful understanding I can gather is that of what's on stringed instruments such as guitars, that of the small metal bars across the fingerboard and when the string is stopped by a finger at the metal bar it will produce a note of the desired pitch... so all this fretting that \"Maynard - The vocals to the band tool that made this song\" is reffering to here is just asking you to make the desired pitch of tone for all the following; [figure] your body and how you want to look, [latte] your taste and what you'd like to do in your spare time (is what I think it's referring to, because eating is much of what we do in our spare time in the current reality... and also the tastes that we have for fun and the like), [hairpiece] don't forget the finer details!, [lawsuit] what sort of makeup do we want of the new world?-what universal laws?, [prozac] How do we want to show our sympathy?, [pilot] what do we want our heart(s} to made up of-our sort of innerpilot?, [contract] What sort of stories do we wish to !dive! into?, [car] and from former \"!dive!\", how do we want to transition into the stories?\n\r\nIT'S A\r\nBULLSHIT THREE RING CIRCUS SIDESHOW OF\r\nFREAKS\n\r\nI think he's saying it again, to let us think about the people that didn't make it, and what sort of levels of differences and similarities we want in each of our \"heavens'\"\n\r\nHERE IN THIS HOPELESS FUCKING HOLE WE CALL LA\r\nTHE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT IS TO FLUSH IT ALL AWAY.\r\nANY FUCKING TIME.

This song musically and lyrically really reminds me of \"pro-catastrophe\" by failure... so much I am entirely certain it was the original source of inspiration to write aenima. I find that pretty amazing considering how this is arguably their most popular song ever. \n\r\nThis just goes to show how f'ed up it was that failure was as comercially unremarkable as they were.\n\r\nThe song meaning is more or less evident; it's about how backward things are, how out of synch humankind has become with nature and meaningful things... and how, we are all ultimately part of life, \"one\", no matter how we branch off, twist ourselves up and alienate ourselves. It will be righted by life sooner or later (e.g. all references to mom, to the prophecy that cali will shift underwater and stuff).\n\r\nI've always found it a little ironic that maynard passionately & obsessively hates anything religious (organized religion) and the concept of people who give up autonomy to have faith in a person or thing.... yet his whole personality is one of judgment, intolerance, arrogant confidence that he knows the truth of how things are \"supposed\" to be. If only he had the desire he would be a GREAT cult leader. ... which is probably why tool has been as successful (i.e. attracted crazy ass fans) as it has.\n\r\nYea... the profane and cynics are mirror images, created from the same logic... \r\nSo everything he is trying to accomplish with tool is ultimately unproductive (except perhaps personal catharsis).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_348": "\nI agree with arethemad, Maynard is the best songwriter these days (ever in my opinion).

I believe that the central just is that a \"thinking\" or a higher/more-educated member of society has the unfortunate burden of interacting with lower or \"hick\" level people, that in our ideal would be \"washed away\" by the \"Armageddon\" or cleansing through extinguishment of the \"lower-thinker/class\", whilst I agree that the idea of wiping the \"dumbfounded dip shits\" from the globe sounds attractive, I feel that Maynard as is the case with my self is just expressing his frustration NOT hatred or direct ill wishes towards the lower populus. I think that the song is a vent for negative feelings towards those people that \"fret for\" worry about things not ultimately important or things that they have no/little control over; these people are the ones that should be cleansed from the world according to many people's beliefs. The lines: \"Some say the end is near\" & \"Fuck L. Ron Hubbard\" are in my opinion references to \"cult\" type religions such as Jehovah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s witnesses and Scientologists that seam to use fear and absolutes to instruct/control there followers, I believe that Maynard has a lot of experience and commonsense that leads his way of thinking towards more reflective and open minded philosophy. I would agree also that lines referring to: \"Mom's gonna fix it all soon\" refer to \"Mother Earth/Nature\" through global-warming/clement-change, earth-quake/Flood-Tsunami &/or Pandemic-Viruses(or if cosmic forces are able/inclined: astroid collision) likely to try to rebalance the population to past levels. - The line: \"three ring circus sideshow of\r\nfreaks\" and other more specific lines I feel refer to the general loss of focus on local/individual needs, instead of the selfish and self-centred priorities that modern life and economics have forces on us - and how we should take more time in reflecting on who/what we are not what we can get. \r\nThank you to anyone that has lasted the distance to read what I have written and any feedback is welcome: millin-\"at\"-bestdeal4u.com.au\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_385": "\nI haven't read all the posts so sorry if this has already been said but- arizona doesn't have a bay, the only way it would have a bay is if california sunk and then you'd have to swim to the nearest land which would be 'arizona bay'\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_386": "\nthis song is also how people worry too much about\r\nthe littlest things in life. nobody cares about anything better, or to better themselves. like even thinking for yourself for starters or thinking in general haha! thats why he says\n\r\n\"Fret for your figure and\r\nFret for your latte and\r\nFret for your hairpiece and\r\nFret for your lawsuit and\r\nFret for your prozac and\r\nFret for your pilot and\r\nFret for your contract and\r\nFret for your car\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_387": "\nPretty much the apocalypse and how he would like it to happen cause he tired of the bullshit...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_388": "\nI  looked up what (i cant type it) Aenema means.  It is a combination of the words 'anima' (Latin for soul associated with deep emotionality and the force of life itself) and of course enema which...yeah, means anal cleansing.  This is Tool's new version of the word catharsis-or cleansing of the soul.  This song appropriately illustrates this need.  To Maynard, LA is the prime example of humanity's frivilousness and inane ambitions.  This hopeless hole of humanity that ironically is one of the most popular cities in America.  California can in essence, be used to represent the thoughts of america's citizens as a whole.  Maynard is just tired of the shit, the circus of worthless people with worthless ambitions.  It seems he is suggesting the solution to the problem to be a cleansing by flood, or wash into the ocean.  His advice for those dregs of society?  If you want to survive this needed armageddon, learn to swim.  Maynard'd tone is pitiless and full of contempt.  Flush the problems away.  Wash away the sins of humans.  Noah's ark come to mind?  Aenima-cleansing of humanity.  Cleansing of the human's spirit of sin.

WE HAVE A WINNER.  While it may seem hypocritical, and fuck sure theres a chance it very well may be, HYPOCRISY IS A TRADITIONAL TRAIT IN HUMANITY. Human beings are hypocrites.

God or Allah or any Higher Power more or less probably doesnt give a shit or two about the planet.  not a single fucking caring hair.  NONE.  i think it was actually the Prophet Mohammad that sed the only thing that matters is what we do before we die.  and i think this whole concept of Armageddon is metaphorical, and thus you should probably get your shit together.  the planet has certainly become too trashy, alot less pure, and alot less optimisitc and spiritual.\r\nthis is OUR time to redeem ourselves.  we're about to be judged one way or another.\n\n\r\ni love to think that our body is a temple.  its a conduit.\r\nour bodies is the fabrication tool used to find spiritual peace.  why do u think the good die young?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_474": "\nwhile im here, i might as well take a moment to adress something.  \n\r\nwe as Human Beings, in fact have the ability of reason.  its a rather imperfect concept, more or less rational, but nonetheless its a feat that is not optional.  we CAN NOT help that fact that we were born into terms of hatred and madness.  it is what perfects us in means on imperfection.  precisely my current subject.  we are completely IMPERFECT to the point of perfection.  we are perfectly imperfect/irrational.  \r\na mildly disturbing example is like back in the old days of heirarchical trees.  a kind and wife would breed to make a prince and princess, who would in turn mate to make 2 children that would breed.  much liek dogs.  they are inbred in madness and imperfected body and blood in hopes that one day they would become the most pure blood that may start the chain again.\n\r\nall of our faults, our mistakes are what in fact make us more mature, grown up, realistic, rational, perfect.  no i dont mean perfect as in hairstyle, body shape, sense of humor, intelligence - that all comes in some form of a balance, but what i mean is in means on spirit.  the body we were given is precisely a temple as they claim.  funny thing about that is our crown chakra is sitting on the 'throne' in the 'temple'  LOL\r\n-.-\r\nmorale of the story:  dont take anything to seriously that your bubble will burst.  there is ALWAYS room for mistakes and fuckups.  if your boss or authority doesnt think so, 'fuck em'\r\nthere has GOT to be infinite space for what seems to be the infinate amount of people.  bottom line here is basically to find your moral center, find happiness, maybe even find some love, and you are all set for whatever might happen > meteor armaggeddon, flooding, metaphorical havoc of the world, aliens, bible, world war, or even....nothing.\n\r\nyou are prepared ^.^\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_475": "\nPlease be open minded enough to at least accept opinions here.\r\nAlso, I gravely want to apologize for all of the grammatical errors I posted above previously, I simply wanted the information out as it was coming out of my head.\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\n                               -Armithel\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_476": "\nWho is L.

This song seems to be saying that with the way our culture is today, we basically need a social enima. We need to clean ourselves from the way we are heading towards and strive for a better tomorrow. He seems to be saying that when that time has come for this cleansing of the souls, you best be prepared. \"Learn to swim\" I feel is basically saying, survival of the fittest (or smartest). If you're able to withstand the cleansing of the human race, then obviously you are either stronger, smarter, or luckier than the rest of the population. \"F\" everything and anything that our culture is heading towards and has become because it's useless.

There are things much more important in life and the trends just distract you from what's real.  California is a great place to base this song, because california is on a faultline, and scientists have theorized that one day it will sink away from america because of the fault line.
