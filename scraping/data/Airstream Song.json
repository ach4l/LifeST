{"comment_0": "\nthis is one of my favourite songs by miranda, ever. it has such a yearning feel to it and she makes the gypsy life seem so liberating. the lyrics are simple and lovely and just wishing for a life about the simple things. being able to pick up roots and leave and wander around carefree and breaking hearts. love the nod to emmylou harris [but i was born a red dirt girl]. whole song makes me feel wistful.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThe song for a restless soul like me and many others... \r\nA favourite roadtrip song\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nLambert explained this acoustic country swing number, which was inspired by a 1980 Merle Haggard song: \"I've been obsessed with Airstreams for a while now. I don't really know why. Don't have one, don't need one. But I want one! I always do 'The Way I Am' by Merle in my show, if I have an encore, just because I love that song, and it's not right not to play a Merle song on stage. I was telling Blake (Shelton) one day, 'There's a song missing that I haven't written yet.' He said, 'Why don't you go write \"The Way I Am\" for you?' And I did. That song is definitely, what if I wasn't doing this? What if I could just fly away out of my body for a day?\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
