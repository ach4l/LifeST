{"comment_0": "\nThis song, more than anything, is a cry for help. The person feels haunted by the love he never should have let go, desperately trying to find a way to free himself from this emotional torment. But no matter what he does, where he goes, or who he dates, he's always going to love that one person, never able to truly and fully let go of what they once had. \n\nIn the first chorus he begs for redemption, asking \"Shouldn't there be some small exemption, if he does all that it takes to admit to his mistakes, till the truth batters and breaks his world apart.\" He has admitted to his wrong doings, understanding the impact the truth can have on a person's life, and he is, simply, begging (to a higher power) to relieve him of this pain---he has done his time so to speak.\n\nTime doesn't heal everything.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nIt could also mean a love so great that the person is looking for the dead loved one and he can't get over the loss of him or her. When in the song it says \"Small Exemption\" and \"Forgiveness\" the person may be putting the blame on him for the death of the loved one. And is always looking for an answer and a way to get the loved one back somehow and in the beginning of the song it says \"Mystery\" because there is no solution to finding that person because of his or her passing. And when it says \"Convinced I've found the one I'm dreamin' of  And it's always gonna be u that I love\" could mean he had a dream of the dead loved one being convinced he had found the person but when he woke up realized it was only a dream and simply stated you will always be the one I love.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI can relate. No matter what I do that person is only thought. I've tried doing everything to forget but it just makes it that much worse. So many years have past but I miss the person just as much as when we ended. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
