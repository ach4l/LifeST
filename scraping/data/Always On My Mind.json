I just love his voice.\r\nI love the way he made this song all slow and gaah. I just love it. I'm so glad he didn't completely fuck it up like Pet Shop Boys did. No offense to them, they have their style of music, just their version of this song makes me want to barf. But back to Michael, he did it brilliantly and yeah. I love him. He's so talented and he seems like a really funny and nice guy so kudos to you Michael =]\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis song is amazing.\r\nIt basically about the guy I love.
