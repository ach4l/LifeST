Elvis at his best.I love how his voice alternates between a hush and then builds to a crescendo. Gives me tingles. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nGorgeous version!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis song....I cannot let go of. He also did renditions of other people songs and he did them better than the writers. \"Bridge over Troubled Water\", \"Unchained Melody\". WOW  I am coming of age I see the beauty of Elvis' voice and him as a person. Such a tragedy. Still we allow our loved ones the be taken under by drugs and alcohol.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
