{"comment_0": "\n\"Kyrie\" is a Greek word, and it means \"Lord\".  I'm pretty sure about that.  \n\nPeople may recognize the word from the traditional Catholic call and response prayer: \"Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison, Kyrie eleison\" which means \"Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
