I'd like to share some sort of physicians point of view. Spech in general is a wave of a specific amplitude and frequency, moving air and thus creating a, for human standards, sound. Vowels generally spoken are a constant wave of a specific frequency, amplitude and phase, while consonants are waves of different type woven together. No a vowel will sound the same backward masked, but in combination with consonants it may sound somehow like a different word spoken. So, except for some sarcastic comments about backward masking by iron maiden and such, most songs, reversed, will sound like _some_ strangely pronouncated words, not necessarly making any sense.

I was hoping to find out what the Beatles were really saying in Strawberry Fields Forever.  The show was disappointing on that issue, but the host ranted on and on about satanic messages decoded by playing pop music backwards.  To buy into his argument, you needed to accept the theory that the human mind can, on a sub-conscious level, process words played backwards  (my opinion on the subject is pretty firm, but beyond the scope of this forum).   To support his position he played segments of a few tunes--The Beatles, The Stones, and quite a bit of Led Zeppelin--most of which left me saying to myself, \"well, yeah, if you really use your imagination you could say it sounds like that.\"  His last example was Another One Bites the Dust which to me sounded unmistakeably like \"start to smoke marijuana.\"  I feel that the recording wasn't altered.  The show's producers could have remixed some of the other music to make a better case for satanic messages, and clearly they didn't.  I can't at this time put much stock in the theory that Another One Bites the Dust contains a message from satan.  My theory is as follows:\r\n    A writer in the recording industry wants to get the religous right upset about something.  He spends a night, maybe several, speaking various short messages into a recorder and playing them backwards.  I can just see him saying \"Impeach Reagan...that sounds awful...Buy Pornography...that doesn't sound like anything...Kill the Pope...nothing!\"  then finally \"Start to smoke marijuana...another one..bites...the dust...HEY!  If we say another one bites the dust at the right tempo, it'll sound just like start to smoke marijuana!  The Moral Majority will wet itself!

First I have too say that this song is clearly one of the \"grooviest\" songs of all time. It has a \"way groovy\" 70's sound to it, and from my research this was no accident. As with a lot of songs (poetry + music= song), there is not simply one meaning, and it is for each to interpret. Based on the lyrics themselves and the man who wrote them, knowing his sexual preference as heterosexual even though the man who actually sings the song is homosexual (look these facts up for yourself-you have to do your own homework) I believe this has a partially, as with a lot of songs, a \"love/heart broken/bitterness\" underlying theme in this song, but that is not all that is there. I believe that the writer has successfully drawn exquisite analogies and painted such a vivid picture with these lyrics, he has to have witnessed firsthand some sort of dangerous situation involving perhaps the death of someone, whether it was by drug use, or perhaps even literally by a gun. He's (Steve) is walking \"warily down the street\" with his hat \"brim pulled way down low\" (clearly he is in a bad part of town somewhere), again either literally, or figuratively. The only sound anyone can hear is \"the sound of his own feet\" and be prepared with \"machine guns ready to go\". \"Are you ready, are you ready for this. Are you hanging on the edge of your seat. Out of the doorway the bullets rip to the sound of the beat. Another one bites the dust (did he just see someone get shot?) And another one gone (he's seen this before)...Hey, I'm gonna get you, too (Who are you? Drug abuse?) Another one bites the dust.\" That's how you break down a poem.
