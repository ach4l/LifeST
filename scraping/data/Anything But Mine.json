He obviously has feelings for her and doesn't want to leave, which is why he can't see her as \"anything but mine.\"  While they are listening to the local band, everything feels right, and he tells her he loves her.  Then he laughs, but I imagine it to be an awkward/forced laugh that he uses to cover up his true feelings for her.  The video is beautiful, and seeing Kenny play this last night in Chicago was amazing.  The video shows that the boy writes this song as a goodbye for the girl, which she receives the next morning after he has left.

I love the way the lyrics and the melody blend together.  Like they were meant for each other and are inseparable.  And so descriptive.  Anyway here is the meaning according to Clint Eastwood.\n\r\nThe key to this is that Mary's got a boyfriend already and it's not him.  How are all you people missing this?  So he and Mary have become really close friends (and maybe lovers but I think not) and would be a real couple except for her boyfriend (fianc\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9e?).  He and Mary are probably the same age and the boyfriend is older (sound familiar?) and she can't leave the boyfriend because he probably has a job and real prospects or whatever.  \n\r\nWhen he says \"So tonight I hope that I will do just fine\" he is hoping that he can be the same friend they have been in the short time they have been together.\n\r\nBut it sucks because he really, really wants her and he can't see her being with the real boyfriend.\n\r\nGreat song!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nI remember when I just started loving music, it was country. Now, I can barely listen to the stuff, it's mostly corny, unoriginal bullshit.\n\r\nBut the nostalgia is just SO intoxicating and it kind of makes me cry when I hear songs like these. Cause I was young and didn't think about anything but music and my friends. And now I think about too much. I didn't care about money, worry about my mom, I didn't come home from school every day miserable. I remember listening to this song in the car with my mom. \n\r\nI used to love Gretchen Wilson :) (still kind of do but don't tell anyone)\n\r\nNow, I love Radiohead, Nirvana, Lady Gaga, Madonna, and the Smashing Pumpkins. Just like my life, my music tastes have completely changed. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nLove this song.  It reminds me of how when my relationship started it was a long distance one.  I lived in Southern California and he lived eight hours away in my hometown in Northern California.  Granted, that's not the longest distance ever, and saw each other about once a month, and eventually were able to move closer together and stay together, but it was hard spending time together and then having to watch him leave or having to be the one to leave, especially in the beginning of the relationship because we weren't sure where it was going at first due to the distance.\n\r\nYou can interpret so much about this song, which is kinda the point of good songs, it makes you think and there are probably no \"right\" answers (I don't know, ask Kenny, or whoever it was who wrote the actual song!).  But this is what I think:\n\r\nI think he's spent the summer (or maybe even less than that) with a girl and he has to return home and this is his last night with her.  He does want to have sex with her before he leaves (\"there's so much I want to do to you\" and \"Tonight I hope I will do just fine\" are quotes that seriously indicate that), but it is clear he really cares about her so while he wants to have sex with her, I believe one of the reasons is that he really wants to leave her with a good impression with her, which is why he hopes he will do just fine.  \n\r\nIt does bother me when it says \"In the midst of the music I tell her I love her but we both laugh cause we know it isn't true.\" But what I think it means is that they haven't spent enough time together to know if it is really \"love,\" and they know they can't be together at the moment due to him having to go back to Cleveland, so \"love\" really isn't even a possibility at that point in time.  I also think that telling her he loves her would create a heavy mood, and it seems like they are just trying to enjoy their last night together and have fun and not allow things to feel too serious or sad, although it seems he is very sad and trying to hide it.  I think the music brought out an honest feeling out of him, so he says he loves her, but then they laugh because it was unexpected and with him leaving the next day, there's no point in saying it.  He doesn't really know where things are going right now, so there is a lot of confusion.  With him saying \"I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine,\" alludes to the fact that there is a possibility he will see her again, or that they've made some sort of future plans, but he isn't 100 percent sure there will be a follow through.  \n\r\nOr maybe he was doing the typical guy-thing and telling he loves her so he can get laid, but cares about her too much to lie to her, so he laughs after... either way, he is being really honest with her which shows that he does have deep feelings.\n\r\nI think the line \"I hope I will do just fine,\" simply means he wants to leave a good impression on her or perhaps he is losing his virginity.  It seems like a young romance.  \n\r\nSomeone suggested that Mary has a boyfriend and that he's just her friend, so that's why he says \"I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine.\"  There's no mention of another guy in the picture, but who knows.  I think he just can't picture her with anybody else or himself with anybody else.  \n\r\nI think \"I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine\" means that he can't picture her with anyone else, so he thinks that fate will somehow bring them back together again.  It's like he has faith that they have found such a great connection that he trusts they will be able to connect again and I think him wanting to take their relationship to the physical level is part of that faith that they will somehow see each other again.  \n\r\nHe believes what they have found is not easily replaceable and he can't picture anyone else entering the picture, so he is hopeful he will really get to see her again.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nThis song takes me back to the summer when i went to Washington D.C. for a band trip.

Think back to your summers after high school and between college. He is away from home, possibly surfing for the summer or working a job along the coast. She may be doing the same.\n\r\n1.

I tell her I love her, And we both laugh, 'Cause we know it isn't true - They do having feelings for each other, but they know it is not true love. True love is an action, not a feeling. They love spending time together, but know it is not meant to be (or can't be). Imagine a summer romance before heading off to a major commitment (joining military, school, etc ..). Something that you cannot delay or get out of.\n\r\n3. Anything but mine - He is describing how he feels. They fit together \"like peas and carrots\" (sorry Forrest). Think back to a young romance where feelings were so much of who you were (typical in young adults) and what you did. \n\r\n  On a side note, this is why sex before marriage is a mistake no matter how you look at it. People (especially young people) are not prepared for the emotions and feelings that come with such a personal act. It was designed to be shared between a man and woman who are committed to each other for life. A bond that is never broken. A marriage. True love is staying committed and putting that your spouse above and before yourself. Making their needs the priority and the focus.
