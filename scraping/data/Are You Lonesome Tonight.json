{"comment_0": "\nA great song about unrequited love. You really get the sense that hes singing this on stage alone with nobody in the audience.  He seems so frail singing this song, unlike Elvis' usual character.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI dedicated the part where he's talking to my ex. Thats exactly what I feel. This song is so sad knowing that he still love this person very much but they have doubts on coming back. Hopefully Elvis got the girl in the end.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis is such a sad song, i love it.\r\nI learned the wole part where he's talking last year and recited it in class and the teachers were like: 'kid, what are you talking about??' lol\r\nI love his voice in this song, its so serious and sad, love it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI cant beileve nobody commented! lol, I hate elvis. but this song makes me cry. :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
