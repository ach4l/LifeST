{"comment_0": "\nAD: \"As I Sat Sadly By Her Side\" is the first single taken from \"No More Shall We Part\". Can you tell us about the song and why it was chosen as the first release from the album?\n\r\nWell, I just really like that song. It's got a bit of pace to it. Quite a few of the other songs were quite slow and we didn't want to do that again, really. So it does have a bit of pace to it. The song itself is a philosophic kind of discussion between two people, which happens to be myself and my wife looking out through a window at the nature of the world and of our internal worlds. She's seeing everything as wonderful and beautiful and I retort with the other side of the story about humanity and (in) the third verse she admonishes me for being such a miserable old bastard and that's pretty much what that song's all about.\n\natomicduster.com/interviews/nickcave05_01/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI'm not sure why it's thought the the male in the song wins the argument. She has the last word, kitten in hand, and her point is quite right. \n\r\nWe are - each of us - trapped in our individual consciousness. We are to be judged (by god, others, the force, whatever) on what WE do in life, not what happens external to us. \n\n\r\n\"\"When will you ever learn\r\nThat what happens there beyond the glass\r\nIs simply none of your concern?\r\nGod has given you but one heart\r\nYou are not a home for the hearts of your brothers\"\n\r\nThe rights and wrong of other people's actions have no bearing at all on what we do in life. So long as your own actions are right, all is well.\n\n\r\n\"And God does not care for your benevolence\r\nAnymore than he cares for the lack of it in others\"\n\r\nMorality isn't about going out of your way to help others, it's about not doing wrong things or making bad decisions. Helping others is good, but it's not what's important. \n\n\r\n\"Nor does he care for you to sit\r\nAt windows in judgment of the world he created\"\n\r\nIn other words: get your own ship in order before looking over that of other people!\n\r\nIf anything she makes his argument look stupid. her tears are probably because he doesn't get it. His smile may be because actually he does. He's just enjoying being depressed. lol\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThank you so very much for posting this amazing song aj2828aj! I am not as familiar with the music of Mr. Cave as I plan to be. I saw the music video for this song and fell in love. Now that I have read the lyrics, I am only more enthralled. Mr. Cave speaks of a balance one can only hope to achieve. Yet he lends sympathy to those who dwell on the darker side, the outside. Those, like myself, who see the beauty and pain of this world and often become \"ugly, useless, and over-inflated\" for no damn good reason... smiling all the time.   \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI think everyone's got the \"winner\" and \"loser\" of the argument in this video reversed.\n\nHe's sitting above everything, looking down on it.  He thinks he's better than everyone below.  He sees everyone else as looking out for only themselves.  \n\nI hear sarcasm when she talks about his \"benevolence.\"  Then she talks about all the ugliness he lets pile up around him.\n\nHe's self-righteous and useless.  He keeps himself apart.  He only speaks of the evils of the world.  And all the time, he does nothing to make the world any better.\n\nBut he doesn't hear her.  He takes a macabre comfort from the pain and suffering of others.  This is why he smiles as he sits sadly by her side.  He can't even see that he's sitting in his own grave.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nFirst of all, the dialogue reminds a bit of the end of the Book of Job in which Job finally protests against the things God made him go through, while God explains the incredible beauty of the world he created (the Leviathan, fathers, mothers etc).\n\nAfter which, God somehow reinstates Job to a more happy state.\n\nFrom my point of view, the final verse can be seen in two ways: she reproaches him the fact that he is judgemental, but at the last moment she is also judgemental\n( Nor does he care for you to sit/At windows in judgement of the world He created/While sorrows pile up around you/Ugly, useless and over-inflated ), so she bursts into crying, while he smiles because of winning the argument. This makes sense, but it's a bit mundane.\n\nThe second way  - it takes a lot of energy to be able to see the world the way she does and even more - to convince somebody of this worldview (energy draining which makes her cry). Seeing the world as he does is anyway useless and her determination to cure him (the one she loves) of piling up sorrows around him finally makes him smile (although he still sits sadly, the world in the background did not actually change). It's like a transfer of states from one to the other.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nThere are hints in this song that the woman he is speaking to may be ill or dying, or perhaps that she has attempted suicide. For instance, he sits 'sadly by her side' as though sitting with someone very sick, and he brushes the hair from her face as though she were unable to do so herself. She is sitting looking out of a window with a kitten in her lap too, which makes her seem like an invalid.\n\r\nI think this song has a rather nasty ending. When the woman becomes angry with the protagonist and tells him not to sit in judgment on the world and starts to cry he can't stop smiling - as though he knows he's convinced her that there is evil in the world and has somehow 'won' the conversation. In the context of her being sick or otherwise the weaker participant in the conversation this is a particularly black ending.\n\r\nAn absolutely amazing song, anyway.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nHe convinces a na\u00c3\u00afve believer that there are unexplainable  evil in the world, from a believers perspective. It is partly about the teodecie problem.\n\r\nThe hair is something that blocks her eyes, here ability to see clearly. But he finally reaches here with his argument and then she attacks him with a tantrum and says that he is wrong, but the very tantrum is the evidence of him being right, thereby smiling.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nI don't agree with you guys, the lady is not sick or diseased, He smiles at the end because the women has contradicted herself between what she has said to him, and he sees the irony and can't keep the smile off his face...also key to this song is the kitten\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nthis song blows me away... really, any of his songs do...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nI concur:  the woman is not remotely indicated to be invalid or ill as I hear the song.  That would not be necessary to this story and Cave doesn't really bandy words.\n\r\nHair?  I see  it as a common gesture of those already intimately acquainted.  One could say it is also a symbolic inquiry:  reaching out to test the reaction.\r\nremember: \"with a trembling hand...\"\r\nI would buy into the 'barrier' symbol mentioned above, except that in this tale, the barrier does not come up until After he has had his say.\n\r\nKitten:  Always stood out to me and I think that it can represent this woman's heart which she gives to him and retracts just as quickly in reaction to his world-view.\n\r\nCave is a fantastic poet, one of my favorite, and I too, will appreciate his outlining of those dark things that permeate any good and whole human life.\n\r\n-phase\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nI still think that it is valid what I wrote above. But I also imagine her to be the church and he being just Cave or any other person. It is a discussion between Cave and the Church.

I know this dynamic all too well, it's what happens in a relationship when one party is depressed but indulginging in it and compelled to bring down his partner. The irony this song is about is how the one who thinks he is so sensitive can yet be so cruel and selfish.\n\r\nI think the third verse, where she lashes out at him, is the crux of the song, and it's the lesson I take from it, every time I listen to it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nI always saw the kitten as a tool she attempts to use to cheer him up as animals do for depressed people.

I like the flavour of that very much, since Cave often speaks to the divine.\n\r\nI never had a solid explanation about the smile on the speaker's face, but I'm entertaining the idea that the speaker's smile comes from realizing that the woman is correct, bringing a conflicting flood of shame and revelation as well as maybe love for the one who holds such passion for his happiness and betterment.  I used to simply dismiss the smile as an arrogant mockery of her idealism, but there could be much deeper and subtle meanings..\n\r\nthanks for sharing!\r\n-Phase\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\ni think that it depicts two very true opinions that we have, and everyone sits on either side of the argument\r\nthe first (the one which the woman holds) is that everyone else shouldn't concern us, that we need to live for us, think of it in a capitalist sence if you will\r\nthen the narrator argues the point that we do need to care for other people, a socialist veiw you could compare\r\ni'm not saying that cave had a political agenda when writing this, but thats just how it comes across, he's just showing the two ways of living - whether you take notice of those around you, or if you do not\n\r\nthe smile at the end, to me, is that the protagonist was just trying to hit a nerve with the woman, that his arguement was just to shit her\n\n\n", "comment_16": "\nit is clear that 2 persons are arguing, i think there are a young man and older women. but,i feel that at the and, woman is crying,because she used to believe in concept that we all are the hearts of our brothers,,but she is so disappointed ,and experienced selfishness in people,that eventually made her realize that concept was just an dream.that is why she is so sad ,and that great tears come from her sorrow,as she see her self in that young man,knowing that he is going to be hurt the same way.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nI think matt2971 nailed it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nAs for the last portion of the song, it seems to me that the singer cares greatly for the woman in question, emphasized by Cave's own words of the song as previously mentioned.  My thought is that it's possible that his smile in his admittedly sad state was one of grim necessity.  Tempering an overly optimistic view of the world with the knowledge of ever-present pain and misfortune may seem a cruel gesture, but some could argue that exposing the negative aspects of life is the better step at the end of the day.\r\nAlternately, perhaps the smile comes from the fact that she's confident enough in her worldview to actively fight with him over it.\r\nI'd like to say that I agree with most of what was said before this - in particular, the notion of the cat as her heart is something I hadn't thought of, and it felt a bit like a revelation.  I definitely do not, however, think that it's someone callously crushing the spirit of another for the pure, cathartic joy of it; I strongly doubt Cave would ever do something like that.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_19": "\nIn my humble opinion this song \n\r\nIt tells the story of the polished seducer.

I think this is simply juxtaposing youthful naievity with cynical experience, in relation to the nature of existence. The girl, who is younger than the narrator ('softly she spoke these words to me and with brand new eyes, open wide'), sees the world as good ('lovely and amazing'). I don't see any evidence of the girl being ill, dying or suffering at all in the lyrics. The brushing of the hair, is simply a sign of affection and intimacy.  The narrator's sadness, I think stems from the fact that although they are intimate they can't agree on the fundamental nature of the world, and shared beliefs are psychologically important for healthy relationships and attraction etc. Cave highlights this by employing 'different' to describe their faces in the second verse. The narrator rebukes, the girl's naievity which upsets her and she rebukes him in turn.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_24": "\nThe song considers private and public morality alongside religious belief.

Soldiers and sailors bring about questions of duty. Physicians and scientists, rational truths (rendered problematic in the postmodern condition ala Lyotard). Labourer and mechanic, again taking orders but related to the economic structure of capitalist society (Witness the man reaching up from the gutter\r\nSee the other one stumbling on who cannot see.) \n\r\nI love how Cave visualises the direction of the philosophical thought with lines such as:\n\r\nAnd with brand new eyes, open wide\r\nWe pressed our faces to the glass\n\r\nLooking at the surface of the world, and the 'external' as described previously\n\r\nThe kitten she did gently pass\r\nOver to me and again we pressed\r\nOur different faces to the glass\n\r\nAgain to the outside but where she sees perfectly ordered society he notes the differentials and inequality of modern society.
