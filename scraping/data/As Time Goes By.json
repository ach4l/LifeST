He delivered the song in a manner that it was meant to be delivered.  Simply put, it was meant to be sung that way.\n\r\nAs for it's meaning, I always thought it paralleled the movie's theme, which was one of sacrifice of love for greater causes (like saving the world).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThere's nothing like a good old fashion love song.This song truly captures the magic of love,heart break,and time along with reality.I agree with Seahawkfan,he did really good.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nsuch a difference between cheesy songs and classic, this is definatly a classic (although it's a little bit cheesy,lol)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nsuch a difference between cheesy songs and classic, this is definatly a classic (although it's a little bit cheesy,lol)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI think that it's talking about love's immortality 'as time goes by' (just stating the obvious).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
