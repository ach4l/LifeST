It was amazing.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis song is about a truck driver who has to work hard and sacrifice being with his girl to make ends meet. He has to get up early each morning to drive truck loads to different parts of the country.  He explains \"I don't want to leave your side\"  The best part of the song is when he expalins \"I'm on a ride that won't let me go.\"  This means he has to do what he has to do in order to provide people with what they need around the country, but also for his wife.  All he wants to do is be with her.  He \" sees her picture by the dashboard light and it takes me where I'd like to be\"  Who hasn't been away from someone they care about and all they can think about is that person. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
