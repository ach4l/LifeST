How can this song exist, and then there are thousands of great songs throughout history that have been nearly, if not completely, forgotten? What about all the great artists in history that actually played instruments?\n\r\nWhat happened to songwriters like John Lennon? What happened to clever rhymes and clever lyrics and lyrics filled with fun innuendos? Are we really doomed to \"Baby (x9) Thought you'd always be mine\" as every song's chorus? What has the songwriting (and music world, in general) gone to?\n\r\nMy last questions: Do you really think people are going to remember Justin Bieber in 25 years time? Will he make Rolling Stone's 100 Best Artists list, like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys and all the other great groups before \"he\" came along? Because we've remembered The Beatles for almost 50 years... Just making that a little point......\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nSimple-This song has no meaning. It's just a teenager who hasn't yet hit puberty, sings like a laughing kookaboora (Spelling, sorry,), and has no talent whatsoever. This kid is fucking 15, hitting 16, maybe even 16 already. How the holy hearts does he know what love means? What a fucking loser.\n\r\nI'm also sick of all these fangirls bitching and saying \"This song was wrote for me!!!!!11111\". Dears, he doesn't even KNOW YOU. He's just another talentless lowlife/loser who plays his 'music' only for gaining money, not for putting time and effort into his so-called 'music'. This little poser doesn't give two shits about you, so fuck off and stop complaining. Sorry for my cussing, I just needed to get all this loserome out of my brain.\n\r\nDamn the music industry.

Don't you know Justin Bieber only keeps his \"hot teen that all the 12 year-old girls want to sleep with\" image so that he can hide the darker side of his lyrics, because he can not go without saying the things that hurt him deep inside, but he also does not want anyone to know about what he feels because they would never understand anyway?\n\r\nBut I understand Justin. I understand it all.\n\r\nThis song is about the internal struggle of a boy with the meaning and purpose of the \"self\", after coming to the conclusion that nothing but Nihilism explains all of the questions and concerns he has about life and the universe. \n\r\nThe song takes an especially strong view on the idea of \"ignorance is bliss\" and Justin's constant references to his childhood are about how he wish he could go back to a time when he did not understand or know anything, and did not have to suffer from the realisation that all life is without purpose. \n\r\nThe \"baby, baby\" is referring not to a girl, but actually to himself as a baby, and the \"ahhs and oooohs\" are pathetic attempts to replicate the sounds he used to make at that time, because out of his desperation he is willing to try anything to go back to when he did not understand anything. The \"thought you'd always be mine\" is of course about his innocence and how he thought he could stay ignorant and blissful forever.\n\r\nThe verses are about how he slowly lost his ignorance over the years, as he learned that the things society teaches us can make us happy (possessions, money, love) made him happy at first \"I'll buy you any ring\", but slowly he finds they are meaningless \"When I was 13, I had my first love, There was nobody that compared to my baby (once again referring to how there was nothing like the ignorant bliss he had as a child)\", and as he keeps living his life he finds that materials and emotions have no value, and Justin struggles to hold onto things but he can not stop a nihilistic view from taking hold of him, \"And I wanna play it cool/But I'm losin' you\".\n\r\nFinally the last verse is a bit ambiguous. The \"I'm gone\" could be referring to the \"self\", i.e. with Nihilsm completely taking over him he now has no conception of himself, and so he is now an empty shell without anyone inside (therefore he in essence is gone, even if his body is still there), OR it could also mean that in his struggle with Nihilism the only way out he could think of was suicide, so the \"I'm gone\" could refer to his falling into the pit of despair and killing himself, but I don't know for sure. You'd have to ask Justin in person to find out...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nIt is about the 'war on terror' and the reactionary nature of western democratic\r\ngovernments.

The line \"Baby, Baby, Baby ohhh\" is expressing excitement for his weed (because I can't see him using anything heavier than that).  The line \"Baby, Baby, Baby nooo\" is JB haggling over prices.  The repeated line of \"Baby, Baby, Baby ohhh\" is driving home the point that Justin has a dilemna: does he need his weed enough to deal with the awful prices.  The line \"thought you'd always be mine\" translates to \"I'd better find a dealer with better prices.\"  This line drives home the message of how sad it is for the two to part ways.
