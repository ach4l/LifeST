{"comment_0": "\nThis song is about a relationship gone bad.  The girl he was broke it off.  He is moving on and just wants to leave town.  \"Hanging my hopes on highway signs.\"  Everything he wanted or dreamed about he has to leave behind while driving on the highway.  He explains there is no way he can get the love back. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.  Just like putting smoke back in a cigarette. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nTo me, this song is about a girl that you have spent time with; put yourself out there to, she possibly has something else on her mind or something else that she wants and cuts you off/tells you goodbye.  Later finding in yourself that it's all for the better because there's more out there for you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis is am amazing song.\r\nI think its about a girl saying bye and this guy is still holdimg on.\n\n\n"}
