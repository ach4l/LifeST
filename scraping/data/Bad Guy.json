{"comment_0": "\nThis is the sequel to \"Stan\" from the first Marshall Mathers LP\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThe first part of the song is a continuation of the story from the song \"Stan\", which was on the first MMLP. It is given from the perspective of Stanley Mitchell's little brother, Matthew. Stan was a mentally unstable fan of Eminem who wrote letters to him, with his mental state visually deteriorating with each successive letter. Em doesn't receive the letters because of a \"problem at the post office\". Stan thinks that Em is ignoring him, and eventually drives his car off a bridge with his pregnant girlfriend in the trunk, killing her too.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nthis is great song that he wrote\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nEminem pretty much explicitly tells you the meaning of this song IN the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis song is the aftermath of Em's \"Stan\" song, it shows how Matthew \"Stans little brother\" is affected by Stans death and how he finds and gets revenge on Eminem for what he supposedly did to his brother.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
