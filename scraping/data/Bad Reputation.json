{"comment_0": "\nIn the song \"Bad Reputation\", Shawn is inferring to the fact that even though this girl was seen in a negative way, he did not care what others said about her. In the line \"And all of my friend seen her naked\", it refers she has slept around with many guys, but Shawn knows things about her that no one else understands. It's a powerful song because we all mistakes, and he is saying he doesn't care what others think.\n\nOverall a 10/10 recommended song:)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
