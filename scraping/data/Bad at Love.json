{"comment_0": "\nI personally, am a sucker for any song with a LGBTQ+ or poly theme, and as usual, our bisexual friend Halsey does not disappoint. In \u00e2\u0080\u009cBad At Love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we see Halsey battle one of the largest problems that face individuals when they join together to become a couple \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the idea that one partner as the ability to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfix\u00e2\u0080\u009d the other. We watch as Halsey jumps from relationship to relationship trying to find someone who will deal with her emotional baggage so that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to. She cites her struggles with jealousy as well as emotional distance she can feel in relationships as reasons why she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cbad at love,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but she clearly has no interest in trying to improve her emotional unavailability, only to wait for the right person to come around and fix it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hoping to hear a new hit from Halsey about the benefits of therapy and an\nawesome new girlfriend (or girlfriends?!) but I suppose we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to wait and see\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
