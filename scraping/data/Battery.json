This is not a song about kicking everyones ass...entirely.  Its simple if you read the actual lyrics. Lashing out the action-the action being the metal music they are playing.  Returning the reaction- when people react negatively they play even more agressively leading to \"weak are ripped and torn away\" meaning that the ones that cannot handle the intensity of the music are sorted out.  Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cover - hypnotizing power of the music that is wailing, crushing all the critics that are doubting them.  BATTERY IS HERE TO STAY!  simple enough in that line.  \"Smashing through the boundries\"  boundries set by society as to what they think music should be.  \"Lunacy has found me\"  Lunacy is part of the inspiration for the hard hitting shit that comes out of them.  \"Pounding out agression\"  The drum beats, solos in the songs \"turns into obsession\"  simple one there.  \"Cannot Kill the Family\"  The family being the metal family that they helped create, cannot be backed down or \"killed\" by the man because \"Battery is found in me\"  which implies that the force behind metal is found in everyone that feels it.  \"Crushing all decievers\"  at the time there were alot of Hair metal bands that were frilly and only in it for the tits and ass.  This brand of real metal that Metallica was presenting was hard hitting real shit that had meaning and real power \"Mashing non-believers\"  Ties into the same thing I just said.  \"Never ending potency\"  Meaning they knew even back then the metal will continue to reach people forever.  \"Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker\"  The violence the weak are what feed the emotions that go into making the music which will continue to be \"Breeding off insanity\"  \r\n  \"Smashing through the boundries\"  They did too,  they never gave up on thier pure ideals about the music and they went through every barrier put up before them.\r\n   \"Circle of destruction, Hammer comes crushing.  Powerhouse of energy\"  The cirle represents the feeling of empowerment that the crushing hammer of the music with all its energy that many people feel from it.  \"Whipping up a fury, Dominating flurry \r\nWe create the Battery\"  The fury is all the screaming headbanging feel it in your soul dominance that is the battery that we ourselves created.\r\n   In conclusion I know it sounds really repetitive what I've been saying but in those days they were very straight forward with thier lyrics..don't read more into it than what it is.

Driven insane, he tries to kill the man and family who created this, but he virtually can not.  Finally, just as he is about to be free, he commits suicide, not wanting to live after becoming that monster.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_87": "\nobviously, this song is about someone beating the living shit out of someone else! this song is kickass! my fav!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_88": "\nThis song is one of my favourites, it has that rhythm that makes you want to hear it again and again.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_89": "\nmetallica= pwnege at all things kirk hammet= idol :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_90": "\nIt's about physical abuse.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_91": "\ncreating a country, you get the rush of power, controlling all those people,their lives in your hands,creating an unstoppable force\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_92": "\ncreating a country, you get the rush of power, controlling all those people,their lives in your hands,creating an unstoppable force\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_93": "\nThink Battery instead of battery...
