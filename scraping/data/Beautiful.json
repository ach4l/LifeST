He wrote the first half in rehab and finished it when he got out. For me this song has very special meaning because it describes the times I am going through with my struggles in my addiction recovery. So below I have written my interpretation as if he were writing this about entering recovery, and using the mic and rap as references to drugs, here is how I saw it before I knew what was behind it:\n\r\n1) In the first few lines when he speaks of being depressed and needing to get out of a slump, I took that as his feeling before he hit rock bottom, that he needed to find another way besides drugs to get him feeling better again, written right before he got clean.\n\r\n2) In the second lines he is saying he took his hits (im not referencing hits of drugs and neither was he) and got back up, but even though he was getting through things he wasn't getting through them sober, so where he references he needed a spark, maybe he is saying he needs a spark to get him to pick his life back up again, and get clean.\n\r\n3) When he says he doesnt know how he ended up in the situation he is in, that he was feeling distant again, I could see that being he is feeling distant from himself, not knowing the real him because he had been hiding behind substance for so long. So he picked up the pen, started to do step work from the 12 steps.\n\r\n4) He up and tried to vent, speaking up in meetings and talking about his addiction, and seeing that he needs to come to grips with his addiction and accept he is done with drugs, and find a new way of life and living. \n\r\n5) By saying he is a tough act to follow he is saying he had a horrible and trifling addiction, that many havent been through, and walking in his shoes is saying it is hard to feel that you fit in with those around you in recovery, and by switching places he could feel what they feel clean, because he wants what they have.\n\r\nAs addicts we have a very low self confidence and low self respect, so he is saying that dont let anyone put you down because of your struggles, dont let them tell you that you arent good enough, but that your strong and beautiful inside. The man servant could be referring to his sponsor, the telling people his tale could be him sharing his struggles with the room. Him not going into these rooms for attention but to get clean and begin a new way of life. By referring to his dad not showing up, this could be an admittance of where his addiction began was the constant abandonment and lack of love. Or referring to fitting in and he did stupid things such as drugs to fit in with the cool kids. \n\r\nThe most touching part of this song is when he is referencing the cards we are dealt, I have felt that because of my addiction and the things I have done, I feel like I have always been dealt the shitty hand, but he is saying that take what you have and deal with it, sober, because god gave us a place in this world for a reason, so flip em and figure it out, and do it sober, it will mean more.\n\r\nI am seeing this song from an addicts perspective, I am 3 weeks clean and can relate to this song as if I wrote it, with the mic and rap representing life and drugs, he has proven himself once again with this song, it is one of his best he has ever produced.\n\r\nSorry if I babbled, or offended anyone, but this song is deep, and for any other addicts in recovery out there,  I think this really hits close to home.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nThis is the best song I've ever heard of in the whole rap genre.

Eminem's just sayin don't let anyone tell you you're not beautiful, anyone who says that they can just go f*** themselves. 2)it's about Eminem's own issues with drug use. he's just saying (quite clearly) i'm in a bad spot and i'm clawing my way out. 3)what he's trying to say to anyone listening. he's saying be who you are, don't let a d*** soul say their's something wrong with being you.\r\nthis song has some personal stake for me. at various points in my life i would've leveled with Marshal. i've been in some slumps; my dad's car accident, when i busted my arm, and right now since my folks split up. (i'm 16) also my folks just plain don't like the who i'm deciding to be at times. wether it's my choices for a career, higher education, and just plain my views on social and political stuff. i'm just thinking don't say i'm not good.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_26": "\nBest eminem song ever. Love the chorus.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_27": "\nI believe that this song starts with Eminem's personal story. He notes his absence from the world of hip-hop and says that no matter how hard he tries to communicate with his fans, they have to be trying to reach out for him as well. He also intimates that the song can be used for anyone who has ever felt down or has felt like an outsider.\n\r\nThroughout the song, he tells of his own life, how it was hard for him to really believe in himself and that he had the ability to keep going with his songs. Even though he had people criticizing him for his songs, he kept getting back up and writing new ones. Over time, he started writing them in the style of other rappers just to try to fit in but he realized that no one took him seriously unless he was himself, so he wrote \"Beautiful\".\n\r\nHe distanced himself off from the rest of the world by keeping his thoughts to himself and doing drugs just to ease the pressure of everything else going on in his life. He finally accepted that he needed to reach out to someone and went through recovery, and it helped him go back to the true Eminem.\n\r\nThis song is meant for people who don't believe that they are worth anything. Eminem says that it doesn't matter how much you try to fit in with the \"cool kids, even if it [means] acting stupid\" because in the end, they will not be there for you. The only people who can call themselves your friend are the people who respect and like you for who you are. It shouldn't matter or affect you in any way when people start putting you down as long as you believe in yourself. Every person is beautiful and should neither judge nor be judged by other people until they have switched shoes with you, or you have changed places with them, to see qhat they have been through. Everyone has had different experiences and each perspective is different depending on what has happened to each person that makes them view the world, other people, songs, etc. in the way that they do. All you can do is be yourself and take control of your own life because you are the only one living it, and no one can take away your experiences or your future away from you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_28": "\nfirst time I heard this one---  I remembered why I loved Eminem.
