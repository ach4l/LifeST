{"comment_0": "\nThis song makes no sense at all, it's completely meaning less. Sure it sounds pretty but the lyrics are horrible \"we're gonna party like it's 3012 tonight\"...what? \n\nThis is the one of the most shallow song I've heard. Not one line in this song has any meaning \"Body rock, girl, I can feel your body rock\" I mean really? I guess you would say it's about....dancing maybe. This song has no story, Justin Bieber would only write this song for fame.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nMost random possible lyrics from Nicki Minag.  Writted just for the same of rhyming.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nIt's more of a dance/radio song but I do know is he's saying all he needs is all he needs is a beauty, a beautiful girl and music. That's all he needs to make his life complete :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThere is no meaning because it is pop/rap music and none of that music has a meaning they are just the performers and don't actually write their own music and they get the credit for it see metal and rock musicians write their own music but apparantly people don't like musicians writing their own music because nowadays it's hard to find people at school who love metal and rock music like me.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
