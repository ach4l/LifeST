{"comment_0": "\nThis is a brutally honest song. So many times, we hold onto relationships because basically we don't have the guts to end it. He's saying, Im going to be completely honest with you, I love you but my heart is divided. I can continue to try and ignore it, but eventually it will break your heart. So get out now before that happens. I believe Kenny wants to but can't sacrifice the life he has to share it with someone else.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nIt's not a break up better as a memory thing.

He's saying that in the end, no matter how much it's hurting her right now, he is not the right guy for her. Throughout the song he lists off his qualities, stating that who he is just isn't the right fit for her. He sees her starting to fall in love with him, he can tell that it would be an unrequited love, so he's ending it now in attempt to save her from further pain. \n\nHaunting, beautiful song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis song is pretty self-explanatory, but for some unknown reason, I really like it.

He's somewhat of a loner but he's happy with it because it works for him, and she accepted him that way because he's honest to a fault.\n\r\nHe needs to let her go so she can be happy...\r\n\"I see you leaning, you're bound to fall,\r\nI don't want to be that mistake\" \n\r\n He doesnt want to break her heart anymore because he know he will.  So he let's her go and it hurts her but he knows in the long run she's going to find a man that loves her the way she deserves cause she's probably really hot!\n\r\nSo below are the verses where he says trust me pretty much someday you'll thank me for letting you go...\n\r\nBut one day you're gonna find someone,\r\nAnd right away you'll know it's true\r\nThat all of your seeking's done\r\nIt was just a part of the passing through\n\r\nRight there in that moment \r\nYou'll finally understand\r\nThat I was better as a memory than as your man...\r\nBetter as a memory than as your man\n\r\nSo she met a great guy amazing in fact and she sees what he was saying finally but she always will love him.\n\n\r\nSo that's the story. Nicks dumb but hey whats a girl to do ya know? He's probably some mad skill guitar player musician that loves his guitar more than any really hot girl.  What an idiot! \r\nP.S- She wants Joint Custody of his dog.\r\nP.P.S-  She will never forget this boy, and kept a plank for that pirate man on her bridge.\r\nThe End.

I've been in a relationship like this. I stayed for almost three years. I loved him more than anything and still do. He loved me, but didn't want to, he wasn't sure what he wanted, but he knew he didn't want committment. Every time I hear this song, I think of him.

That's so steryotypical.\n\r\nLet's just that Kenny is actually experiencing these feelings and similies like he describes.\n\r\nAll of what he says, just shows that you'll \"break my heart, but it wont bleed\" and that's just who he is.\n\r\nHe'll stand alone through all the lovers he'll find. The song is so rich, and deep with so many instances that i've found through all my relationships in my life. The fact that he states, \"i'm pretty good on a lonely night, and \"never stay but then again i might\" shows the uncertianty of his doing, and that you can never trust a man that's \"only friends are pirates\"\n\r\n\"cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel, you never know where they're gonna land\"\n\r\nMakes me cry everytime. Its so true how, sometimes you just cant describe what you heart does.\n\n\r\nSimilar to another country song, \"you cant make a heart love somebody\" you can find many similarities. Everyone's been in one of those relationships where they just love interest and who knows why. \r\nKenny's describing the fickleness that a heart can have,, and how, despite the happiness he could give you, \"he's better as a memory, than as your man\"\n\n\r\nAmazing. Absolutely astonishing the depth that is found from kenny, and especially in a country raido song. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\n**Lost interest.

People stay in relationships because thats all they know and they're afraid to end them cause you don't know what comes next. Pretty much you feel like you lose no matter what you do. It's hard to lose someone you love so much, but in the back of your mind you know thats the only thing you can do. If the relationship isn't working, its best to make a clean break. Its harder than hell, but love will come back to you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_21": "\nGreat song.
