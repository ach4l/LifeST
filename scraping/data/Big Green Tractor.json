He's cleverly puttin it in a sense where it could be where theyre gonna go to a show in town but occasionally when someone says wanna go to town it means hey wanna have sex hah just sayin from non-personal experiences..but also when its like you can climb up in my lap and drive if you want too is basically sayin get on top lol\n\n\n\r\nIDK maybe it isnt about that, but im pretty sure when he was makin the song he also saw that it kinda sounds related to that subject too..but again it is a country so it really could be as simple as ridin a big green tractor\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nLove this song! excellent use of a metaphor for a big green tractor being his dick.

I would always sit on the fender of by exboyfriend's tractor while raking hay. Just crack a beer and watch the day go by. After we were done with a long day in the fields we'd just part it up on the ridge and watch the sun set behind the farm. Such a beautiful thing. Defenitely brings back some memories.

I think it's about giving his girlfriend from the city a choice between going somewhere nice or showing her the country.

The lyrics are so cute and his voice is sexy!

Its about exactly what it says it is not sex. \r\nBig Green Tractor is a John Deere ya sickos.\n\r\n***Jim Collins and David Lee Murphy wrote this song about a couple riding a tractor on a date. Collins appears to have a thing for penning \"tractor\" songs having previously co-written Kenny Chesney's 1999 hit single \"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy.\"\n\r\nAldean commented in publicity materials with a grin: \"There's nothin' more romantic than a tractor. If you live in South Georgia, a Saturday night out on the tractor with your girl is probably not that far-fetched of what could be considered a good 'date night.' The song seems to be connecting already, so maybe tractors have always been romantic, and everybody just needed reminding.\"\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_14": "\nI love this song!!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\ndefinitley agree with caselhgirl 100%! bittersweet memories with my ex too..we did the exact same thing.
