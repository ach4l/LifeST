I'm going to look more on the internet, but if Sir Paul did say that, well, he would be the one to know.\n\r\nTo me, part of the beauty of art, including poetry and song, is to explore what it means to you, in your own mind. As a physician with a busy schedule I still long for a day when I can take classes and explore art ddeply.   It opens my mind, creating new ways of thinking, new ideas, news ways to express old ideas, realizations and better understanding of myself, and connection and openness to everyone and everything around me.\n\r\nI first heard this song this week, on an episode of Glee.  I actually thought it was about death, and the release from human limitation and suffering into an afterlife of peace and freedom. I'm so glad I looked for the lyrics and found this website!  I appreciate all your comments and points of view.  Isn't it interesting how our different lives and experiences have created so many different interpretations of the same song?  I wish that, in our national discourse, we could all appreciate and respect the differences that make each of us unique and special.  That's much more interesting and beautiful to me than everyone thinking and acting and being the same.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI always heard this song was about the plight of African Americans and the yearn to break free and have equal rights. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI've seen Paul live twice, and both times, he played Blackbird, and both times, he said that it was about the civil rights movement.

There was a lot of drug addiction and emotional abuse in my family (father mostly) when I was younger (and still some today) and my mom was a huge beatles fan.  Whenever I heard this song though, it made me feel a lot better somehow.  I did not hear it for a long time, and then a few years back, times were getting harder, and a friend of mine played it on the guitar when I was over at his house with some friends.  I was pretty much in tears when I heard it, because it just brought back all the memories i used to have and the emotions along with it.  \n\r\nIt always makes me feel like no matter what has happened to you, you can learn to fly again and get through all that has happened to you.  It also made me feel like I could just escape from everything I was feeling.  It is a very emotional and personal song to me, and I hope to get a tattoo to always remind me of this fact.

Why is it a blackbird and not a hawk, falcon or eagle that are superior birds of flight?\n\nQ02. Why is it a blackbird and not a bluebird or redbird?\n\nQ03. How can a bird with broken wings fly?\n\nQ04. Since birds are born with the ability to fly, why does the bird need to learn to fly?\n\nQ05. Why does the bird learn to fly all its life and not just once?\n\nQ06. Why was the bird waiting for this moment to arise?\n\nQ07. What do sunken eyes represent?\n\nQ08. How can sunken eyes learn to see?\n\nQ09. Since birds are born with the ability to see, why does the bird need to learn to see?\n\nQ10. Again, why all your life and not just once?\n\nQ11. Given the parrallelism, what is the connection between flying and seeing?\n\nQ12. Why was the bird waiting for this moment to be free?\n\nQ13. What is the light of the dark black night?\n\nAnd then, some answers: \n\nA01. The blackbird is a commonplace bird that represents ordinary human beings with ordinary abilities. \n\nA02. The bird is black because it is esoteric. \n\nA03. The broken-winged bird does not fly physically in body but psychically in spirit. \n\nA04. The bird must learn to fly because it is not external physical flight, but internal spirit flight, contrary to societal indoctrination.\n\nA05. The bird must learn to fly all its life because it is the real life of non-physical spirit and not the illusory life of physical matter. \n\nA06. The bird was waiting for this moment to arise because it had to overcome social conditioning and its repressive values, attitudes, beliefs and unexamined assumptions and presumptions. \n\nA07. Sunken eyes represent tunnel vision, blinkered vision, restricted vision, distorted vision, limited vision. \n\nA08. Sunken eyes can learn to see non-physically, internally, within, psychically. \n\nA09. The bird must learn to see because it is not external physical sight, but internal non-physical sight, contrary to societal indoctrination which is a heavy burden and constant distraction. \n\nA10. The bird must learn to see all its life because it is the real life of spirit in the ever-present now and not the illusory life of matter.\n\nA11. Flying and seeing (flight and sight) are both metaphors for the meditative state of consciousness, a/k/a cosmic consciousness. \n\nA12. The bird was waiting for this moment to be free in the sense of the inner freedom that results from inner vision and the flight to higher consciousness.\n\nA13. The light of the dark black night is the sourceless light, illumination and enlightenment that can result from personal, first-hand, immediate, unmediated, existential experience of the innermost center of being, whereas only darkness and blackness appear on the external surface. \n\nIn summary, every human lifetime on Earth begins with a veil of amnesia that can be penetrated with the practice of meditation to reach the state of meditative consciousness. Everyone is always illuminated in spirit, just they don't remember it. \n\nThe Blackbird song is a celebration of freedom and joy, no less than Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, Final Movement, Ode to Joy a/k/a Ode to Freedom. \n\nwww. youtube. com/watch?v=kbJcQYVtZMo [remove spaces] \nFlashmob Flash Mob - Ode an die Freude ( Ode to Joy ) Beethoven Symphony No.9 classical music\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_159": "\nThe love of song goes on and on and on...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_160": "\nsongfacts.com/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_161": "\nen.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u2026\n\r\nThis was the link I meant to post look under meanings\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_162": "\nI like this song as an insomniac :) especially with the morning break of birds singing.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_163": "\nEvery Time I go to England I hear blackbirds singing and it reminds me of this incredible song. I read a book called Blackbird by Paul McCartney and he said the song was about the Civil Rights movement in America.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_164": "\nAt my graduation ceremony, this guy (who goes to my school) played this song on the guitar on the stage.. Ahh.. I was like \"YES! I love you. *sigh*\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_165": "\nEVERYONE IS WRONG!!! im the only one thats right i did extensive research on the beatles when i was a sophmore in Highschool what this song is saying is it was telling Charlie Manson that there was gonna be a race war and to be come prepared that the blacks were gonna RISE UP and OVERCOME thats basically what this means that the blacks will try to take the planet earth for them selfs they will kill all whites and everyone else i dont know why Charlie Manson is still in prison he was trying to stop the race war and the government is punishing him for it and they are wasting our tax money on him he was trying to stop the blacks \r\nThe family was the best thing to happen Charlie is GOD\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_166": "\nI have a game for you.

I always thought it was trying to say that even when you're weak you need to keep trying.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_169": "\nThe song is extremely simple and can be interpreted as anyone wishes to see, however the true nature pertains to the Rock n\" Roll movement.\n\r\nRock n' Roll was cocked & loaded as the invention of the radio ripened to a substantial potential, reaching a mass numbers of listeners worldwide.\n\r\nAt this moment, it was fired upon the world, attracting millions to the new sound, and in its wake, engulfing open minds with it's message. In the beginning the message was \"good times, dancing, and fun\", but we all know Rock n' Roll (and other spawns of the movement like Hip Hop and Pop) snowballed into a barrage of \"sex, drugs, and immorality\" which, along with technology to empower the spread, has led society into it's Godless nature. \n\r\nThere's always been Evil, but by this, it was fueled to run rampant to a point where we wonder \"what is going on in this world?!?!\".\n\r\nThe Blackbird, symbolizes the dark side buried within us. It is being encouraged to \"arise\" \"at this moment\" (when Darkness has overcome it's boundaries) and see a new way of life, \"free\" from the limitations of following God's Law: \"flying to the light of the dark, black night\".\n\r\nShould I remind you, Lucifer is known as the \"Prince of Light\", and in some perspectives the giver of free will. \n\r\nIn Audio Only this can translate \"into the light of the dark, Black Knight.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
