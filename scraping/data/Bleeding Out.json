{"comment_0": "\nI get the impression that the singer is trying to \"repair\" the burned bridges between himself and someone he cares deeply about. He is willing to sacrifice everything to make things right again. \"So I bare my skin and I count my sins\" give me the image of someone removing their shirt to receive lashes, and each lash represents one crime against the other person. He is showing repentance for his sins. \"So I close my eyes and I take it in\" represents trying to forgive himself so that they can move on. Of course, I connect with that interpretation so that could be why I chose that approach.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nTo me, this song is him singing to someone he loves who is going through pain.\r\nI don't think he literally means bleed when he says \"bleeding out\". \n\r\nHe loves this person so much, he is saying, I will take your pain.

He knows that if he's going to bring someone down even to the last breath, he'd rather die.  He is putting his life out there, willing to live, to the last drop of blood, for the life of the other.\nWhen he says \"Innocence is gone and what was right is wrong\", he realises that his wrongdoings and misunderstandings of what is right in life have been shown for the falsehood in which they live. How can he live with his nature if his nature is so twisted?  Another thought is that he sees himself as the \"one who knows\" and the \"right thing\" (looking the other way, or \"just living\" regardless of the internal destruction to others) is now the \"wrong thing\".\n\nI have so much more I could pick out of this song, but I'd need a lot more space... ;)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThe line is \"So I bear my skin,\" not \"So I peel my skin\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nAmazing music and great band!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI think the song is talking about self-harm and suicide.

The song is sung from Christ's point of view.  It talks about bleeding out for someone else, taking in sins, being told to hold on despite the pain, the world reacting to this event in several ways, there's even the line that says, \"I will be your scarecrow.\"  Scarecrows are used to ward off birds like crows and ravens, both birds symbolizing evil.  Also, you always see scarecrows with their arms completely stretched out, and their legs together, just like Christ's arms and legs when he was hanging on the cross.  Some of the members of Imagine Dragons are Mormons, who are Christians, so it makes sense that this is what they could have meant when they made the song.  It really adds a beautiful meaning to the event of the Atonement, while also capturing the agony and pain that Christ must have went through when it happened, based on the heavy elements and strong beat of the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_35": "\nI personally believe this song is about Christ's death on the cross from Christ's point of view.

The line \"I'm bleeding out for you\" is meant to reference that he died to save each and every one of us (even you).\n\nWhen the day has come \n- The day he was betrayed by Judas\nBut I've lost my way around\nAnd the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground\nWhen the sky turns gray\nAnd everything is screaming\nI will reach inside\nJust to find my heart is beating \n- He is nervous and scared about going through with sacrificing himself\n\nYou tell me to hold on\nOh you tell me to hold on \n- God is reminding Jesus that he must go through with it\nBut innocence is gone\nAnd what was right is wrong \n- Even though he has done no wrong as he is sinless, he was arrested and tried as a criminal and sentenced to death on the cross (which was a common method the ancient Romans executed their criminals)\n\n*Chorus*\n\nWhen the hour is nigh\nAnd hopelessness is sinking in\n- He is getting ready to die\nAnd the wolves all cry\n- The chief priests and the elders calling for his execution\n\nTo feel they're not worth hollering\nWhen your eyes are red\nAnd emptiness is all you know\nWith the darkness fed\nI will be your scarecrow\n- His death is meant to be your saving grace. Even in darkness he will be your light. The line \"I will be your scarecrow\" is a metaphor. Similar to how a scarecrow protects a farmer's crops from crows, the death of Christ is meant to protect you from all the evil in the world.

This also feels like how a depressed individual might view the world, so I can see why people may misinterpret the song as one related to depression and self-injury. This could also be how Jesus felt on the cross (with everyone laughing or \u00e2\u0080\u009cscreaming\u00e2\u0080\u009d at him and the seasons and sky fading, like they know what it means that his end is near). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little extreme of an interpretation, but it could fit. What would fit better yet is a more human explanation. When the individual feels \u00e2\u0080\u009clost\u00e2\u0080\u009d and feels like all is coming to an end, he will remember what he holds dear to him, in his \u00e2\u0080\u009cheart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and keep up the struggle.\n\n3) \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you tell me to hold on / Oh, you tell me to hold on / But innocence is gone / And what was right is wrong.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis feels like Jesus crying out on the cross, as well, doing what is \u00e2\u0080\u009cright\u00e2\u0080\u009d in saving us by doing what is \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d in being crucified despite lacking sin.\n\n4) \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the hour is nigh / And hopelessness is sinking in / And the wolves all cry / To fill the night with hollering / When your eyes are red / And emptiness is all you know / With the darkness fed / I will be your scarecrow\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found my favorite part!

In continuation with the crucifiction allusion, this seems like the part where Jesus is about to die (\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe hour is nigh\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwolves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or people who condemned him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfill the night with hollering\u00e2\u0080\u009d and someone in the crowd, possibly Mary, has \u00e2\u0080\u009cred\u00e2\u0080\u009d eyes from crying. Still, Jesus hangs on the cross, similar to a \u00e2\u0080\u009cscarecrow\u00e2\u0080\u009d in both his physical position and in keeping the darkness from the crops, keeping Satan from his followers. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that a gorgeous comparison? I get really geeked out when unusual metaphors fit so perfectly. The lines would also fit for an individual who sacrifices for his friend, who feels \u00e2\u0080\u009chopeless\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cempty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He intends to sacrifice himself to keep the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdarkness\u00e2\u0080\u009d from taking hold of his friend.\n\nWhat should we take away from this, then? I think we should be better friends. I hope you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re never in a desperate situation where you must chose whether to save your friend or yourself, though the song seems to feel clearly about which is more important. The lyrics should be applied to the smaller things. Perhaps if your friend needs to discuss the pains in his/her life, you should sacrifice your time. If your friend needs a hug, you should sacrifice your personal space. If your friend needs a tub of ice cream and a couple distracting flicks to get over a tough breakup, you should sacrifice your money. Most importantly, this song seems adamant that if your friend suffers from depression, you should sacrifice all you can (in good conscience, of course) to help.\n\nFor interpretations of other songs, check out my blog, toriphelps.wordpress.com\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_39": "\ni think its religious.Jesus is dying on the cross for us.he is bleeding out for us.some tell him to hold on but innocents is gone and what was right is wrong.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_40": "\nGuys this song is about Jesus and the Atonement. They're Mormon. \r\nIm bleeding out for you, Ill bare my skin ill count my sins, ill be your scarecrow, when the day has come, when the hour is nigh, when the say is Grey and everything is screaming, there is so much more. Everything in this song represents the atonement and how Christ bled for all of us and our sins. The world shook when Christ died. For 3 days, there were storms and the hills turned to valleys and visa versa. This song is about sacrifice, but specifically the Great Sacrifice.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_41": "\nFear of hurting someone, rejection, and depression all sorta combined.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_42": "\nSome people consider this to be more of a positive song than others... I'm not one of them.\n\nI think this song is about someone who feels like he's ruined somebody's life, specifically, someone very close to him. His loved one denies it(As the song says \"Oh, you tell me to hold on.\") and seems to try to cheer him up. But the one singing the song doesn't listen and believes that \"innocence is gone\"(Meaning he's no longer innocent) and \"what was right is wrong\"(Meaning that he has made everything wrong) This makes him heavily depressed, and so he resorts to considering suicide(I'm bleeding out, so if the last thing that I do is bring you down, I'll bleed out for you) and self-harming(So I bear my skin, and I count my sins, and I close my eyes, and I take it in and I'm bleeding out. I'm bleeding out for you)\n\nImagine Dragons have made many sad songs, but yikes, I feel this is quite darker than most. Very sad.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_43": "\nI get the feeling that this song is about a person who is utterly in love with another... but that person uses them endlessly. Their lover simply takes and never gives. And whenever the person contemplates leaving the unhealthy relationship, their boy/girlfriend convinces them to stay.\n\n\"I'm bleeding out\nSaid if the last thing that I do\"\n\nBleeding out - reminds me of taking a bullet for someone. Essentially the main person/character that this song is about (the MC) is in a relationship where he'd do anything for his significant other. Even bleed out - to death even. Because that would be the last thing he would do.\n\n\"Is to bring you down\nI'll bleed out for you\"\n\nAgain, he mentions that he would suffer, and practically die for his significant other. He also states that he would never make the other person suffer and always take the brunt of the consequences. The man has a slightly skewed view on what a proper relationship is.\n\n\"So I bear my skin\nAnd I count my sins\nAnd I close my eyes\nAnd I take it in\"\n\nI almost picture someone getting whipped to represent a metaphor. By baring his skin (or back) to get punished. This person gets himself ready to take the pain and suffering. Baring his skin to voluntarily get beat up. By counting his sins, he tries to remember all the things he did to deserve this, justifying his pain. Maybe he thinks he isn't good enough, wasn't nice enough, didn't do enough for his significant other. He closes his eyes to make the pain not seem as bad as it actually is, and takes the pain as best he could. \n\n\"And I'm bleeding out\nI'm bleeding out for you (for you)\"\n\nThe man takes the pain for his lover because everything he does is for them. Rather than in a relationship, he's like a faithful servant that is oblivious to his own unhealthy relationship.\n\n\"When the day has come\nBut I've lost my way around\"\n\nOne day he comes to the realization that his relationship isn't what it once was. His love is different, foreign, and he's lost as to what happened to their relationship. He's utterly dependent on his lover although he is constantly being used. \n\n\"And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground\nWhen the sky turns gray\nAnd everything is screaming\nI will reach inside\nJust to find my heart is beating\"\n\nBasically, he beings to stop noticing his surroundings and time passes, the seasons pass but he doesn't notice. He is too caught up in his unhealthy relationship. The sky is gray, and it's almost like he is depressed, but he doesn't realize it. His entire being is screaming because he is suffering but he continues to ignore it. He continues to believe that he is in a healthy relationship and that he would do anything for his lover. That's why he reaches deep inside of himself to remind himself why he loves his lover.\n\n\"You tell me to hold on\nOh you tell me to hold on\"\n\nAfter his bouts of negative contemplation (gray skies and screaming), there are moments of clarity. Where he considers ending his relationship. But whenever he brings up the topic, his lover convinces him to stay in the relationship. To 'hold on' to what they have.\n\n\"But innocence is gone\nAnd what was right is wrong\"\n\nHis argument is that their innocent relationship has been long gone. That they once had a healthy relationship that was right... Until she took advantage of it and made it poisonous. \n\n\"'Cause I'm bleeding out\nSaid if the last thing that I do\nIs to bring you down\"\n\nHe manages to be convinced that he should stay in the relationship. He states that he's hurting really bad but he did promise that he would never hurt his lover- so he agrees to stay in the relationship. His lover manages to guilt trip him to stay.\n\n\"I'll bleed out for you\nSo I bear my skin\nAnd I count my sins\nAnd I close my eyes\nAnd I take it in\nAnd I'm bleeding out\nI'm bleeding out for you (for you)\"\n\nAnd the cycle continues. He sacrifices his well being and practically living as a servant to his lover.\n\n\"When the hour is nigh\nAnd hopelessness is sinking in\"\n\nSometimes at night he stays up and realizes the endless cycle of his suffering and stupidity for staying in the relationship.\n\n\"And the wolves all cry\nTo feel they're not worth hollering\"\n\nThis reminds me of Call of the Wild. The freedom from imprisonment. But he has a fear of loneliness, and he isn't sure if freedom is worth it. OR- wolves could reference to the fact that he may leave the relationship, but who is to know that he won't enter another abusive relationship?\n\n\"When your eyes are red\nAnd emptiness is all you know\"\n\nHis eyes are red, from crying or from his suffering. He is used to the emptiness of loving but never being loved in return.\n\n\"With the darkness fed\nI will be your scarecrow\"\n\nHe's empty, without a heart. And he is willing to work. A scarecrow scares away crows and birds from the crops all day and night. Essentially, it serves as a metaphor to explain although he's is empty on the inside and full of darkness, he will continue to do things for the sake of his lover.\n\n\"You tell me to hold on\nOh you tell me to hold on\"\n\nOnce again, his lover's argument for convincing him to stay.\n\n\"But innocence is gone\nAnd what was right is wrong\"\n\nOnce again his argument for leaving.\n\n\"'Cause I'm bleeding out\nSaid if the last thing that I do\nIs to bring you down\nI'll bleed out for you\"\n\nBut then he remembers his promise to never hurt his lover and he gives up on his argument to leave and decides to stay.\n\n\"So I bear my skin\nAnd I count my sins\nAnd I close my eyes\nAnd I take it in\nAnd I'm bleeding out\nI'm bleeding out for you (for you)\"\n\nThe suffering continues.\n\n\"I'm bleeding out for you (for you)\nI'm bleeding out for you (for you)\nI'm bleeding out for you (for you)\nI'm bleeding out for you\"\n\nThe cycle never ends. He always bleeds out - he endures the pain. And not for anyone but his lover.\n\n\"'Cause I'm bleeding out\nSaid if the last thing that I do\nIs to bring you down\nI'll bleed out for you\nSo I bear my skin\nAnd I count my sins\nAnd I close my eyes\nAnd I take it in\nAnd I'm bleeding out\nI'm bleeding out for you (for you)\"\n\n\nLike a broken record he continues to endure his relationship. He is enslaved to it and he can never leave, no matter how much he tries because it is his own promise to never leave, to never hurt, and to always stay.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_44": "\nComing to the realization that you have wronged someone and making amends .
