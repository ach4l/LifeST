{"comment_0": "\nThe lyrics are presumed to refer to an English idiomatic expression: a blue moon is either the second full moon in a month or the third one when four full moons occur in one season of the year, which is a somewhat rare occurrence. If something happens \"once in a blue moon\" it happens almost never. The narrator of the song is relating a stroke of luck so unlikely that it must have taken place under a blue moon.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nJust to me a cool cool song in the C Am Dm G7 mode of the fifties.  But also thot blue moon had something to do with volcanic ash in the 1900's obscurring the moon and making it blue-- making that a very very rare ocurrence.  SOng is cool when redone in the sixites mode.  Jazz interp is cool too for a different rendition.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nA down on his luck narrative voice finds solace in a rare and beautiful full moon.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
