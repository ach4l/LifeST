{"comment_0": "\nWant my overanalyzed take?  It's pretentious, silly and yes, overanalyzed, and completely destroys the entire song!  It turns a cool song into another piece of dirt and manages to be glaringly wrong in the way!\n\r\nOkay, let's make it the classic stages of acceptance after a shock.  He just killed someone.  Duh.  It's in the lyrics.\n\r\nFirst comes shock.  Note the 'is this the real life / is this just fantasy' it opens with and the dreamlike tune it's in.\n\r\n(from this point on, it's all within his head.  All of it.)\n\r\nNote also the 'I need no sympathy' melodramatic nobleness he takes on in a play to get sympathy.  \n\r\nHe comes back to the world, and immediately tries to turn to the childhood source of sympathy, his mother.  He tries again to act like a hero, telling her 'nothing really matters' (in his mind, of course.  it's all in his mind.)\n\r\nThe chill of what he has just done rips across him, and at the first glimpse of pain he immediately goes into the classic 'I wish I was never born!'-type complete theatrical show, hoping once again for sympathy.\n\r\nNow comes the weird (albeit exceedingly cool) part. \n\r\nThe trial.\n\r\nFirst his 'judges' (representing the severity and harsh reality of the consequences) come forth, half-threatening him with taunts of \"scaramouche / scaramouche / will you do the Fandango\" (it's defined above)\n\r\nHe crumples, first expressing shock.  Then, he twists his earlier defeated hero's claims to say \"I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me\" in a direct appeal to reality.\n\r\nHis other side, however, rushes in to try to save him from himself, begging the judges to release him.\n\r\nHe appeals, and is rejected.\n\r\nHis consul appeals several times in turn to allow him to stay in his own dreamlike state of deconnectedness.\n\r\nThe judges continue to strike down his pleas, growing more and more forceful, until he finally realizes that he has lost.  First is a generic \"well, I lost.  I'm going to hell, and I've got a demon with my name on it\" first realization.\n\r\nThen comes the anger phase.  He strikes back at the world and himself with guitars in the background (note the playing of a much stronger version of the theme from the opening \"mama\" part) .  He then tries to escape outright, claiming he's \"just gotta get out / just gotta get right out of here\".\n\r\nHowever, after a crecendo, he realizes that he's not about to win anything or survive anything, so he simply resigns.  It's very similar to the opening sequence--although instead of a dream, he seems much more lucid in this state.  He repeats much of what he's said earlier, only now he either believes it or has no choice but to accept it.\n\r\nThere.  I think it's an interpretation of the process gone through after a shock.  It's quite obviously wrong, but I can't help but thinking it.  \n\r\nBesides, it's my favorite song.  Let me warp it however I want ;)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\n\"Bismillah\" is the opening word in the Qu'ran (Koran) and literally means \"In the name of Allah.\"\r\n\"Scaramouch\" according to the dictionary means \"a stock character who appears as a boastful coward.\"\r\n\"Beelzebub\" is one of the many names given to the Devil (yes, it is spelled this way-not as above).\r\n\"Fandango\" is a Spanish dance done in triple time.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI finally got it! My father told me it was based on Albert Camus' novel, The Stranger and suddenly it all made sense! (Great song AND book).\r\nThe book is an existentialist novel. This relates to the first lines and can especially be seen in the line \"Nothing really matters to me\"\r\nIn the first part of the novel, the main character, Meursault, isn't fully conscious of the life around him.  He doesn't even cry at his mother's funeral.  He just goes through life living day by day. Until he murders a man.  Just as he truly began to live,  he was imprisoned. \n\r\n\"Mama, just killed a man\r\nPut a gun against his head\r\nPulled my trigger now he's dead\r\nMama, life had just begun                              (This line especially emphasizes this)\r\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away\"\n\r\nThe second part of the novel covers Mersault's time in prison and in court. Which is the second part of the song, \n\r\n\", we will not let you go\r\n(Let him go!)\r\nBismillah! \r\nWe will not let you go\r\n(Let hime go!)\r\nBismillah! \r\nWe will not let you go\r\n(Let me go!)\r\nWill not let you go\r\n(Let me go!)\r\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\"\n\r\nAt the end of the novel, he is sentenced to death. And again, he goes back to his old way of thinking. NOTHING MATTERS.\n\r\nIt has NOTHING to do with Freddy's battle with AIDS. They didn't know what AIDS was until the 1980s.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nIt's difficult to analyze a song who's writer refused to analyze it himself. The band doesn't even know the true meaning, to this day. It is claimed to be just a tongue in cheek mock opera- just for fun. There are countless theories but that is one I just can't allow myself to believe. Freddie went through too much, he was too complex, too mysterious, too talented, to just write a song this amazing about nothing. \n\r\nI'm all for having an open mind, but the AIDS interpretation is also impossible. Freddie didn't even really know what AIDS was until shortly before he was diagnosed. This song was written in 1975- and it may have been started even earlier. I'm sorry- but AIDS became a thing in the 80's- at least the late 70's- in New York- not 1975 in England. \n\r\nSuicide can definitely have an involvement in the song, as well as his struggle with his sexuality, his rocky relationship with Mary at the time, his relationship with his parents, with himself even. I believe that a number of events and emotions and struggles were all stuffed down the throat of this song. There were some intense feelings going on in that young, confused 29 year old's mind- that's for sure. \n\r\nI think that, just because this was during the exact time Freddie had an affair and was feeling guilty and was extremely confused with his sexuality- the gay thing could absolutely play a major role- if not the entire role- in the song. I'll explain with a few examples...\n\r\n\"Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality\". Freddie was stuck in a scary, awkward, confusing spot. He was in a 6 year long relationship with his best friend Mary Austin- yet he was having an affair with this man. He hated himself but he couldn't help himself at the same time. He didn't understand his feeling and he couldn't escape the situation. The guilt.\n\r\n\"I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy\". When looking back on the end of their relationship, Mary said that Freddie seemed extremely upset with himself. He felt this overwhelming feeling of guilt. This plays into the whole song. He feels like such a low form of humanity that he constantly puts himself down throughout the song. Going against himself. Telling himself that he has not been a good man and therefore deserves no sympathy or love.\n\r\n\"Anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to me\". This could actually be playing onto the bisexual thing. Whether he is loving a man or a woman- it doesn't matter. He doesn't care. \n\r\n\"Mama just killed a man...\". Okay so these \"Mama\" verses may actually be Freddie speaking- not to his mother- but to Mary. He used \"Mama\" throughout the years in plenty of songs- so you can't take it literally- as if he is talking to his actual parent. The \"man\" in the story could be seen as himself. Yes, you can take the suicide route here and look into that more- but I prefer the idea that the man is not just him- but it is the him that everyone knew at that time. The straight Freddie Mercury who had a girlfriend. The guilty, bisexual Freddie is one speaking. So if you understand these roles you can understand it all from that point of view. The guilty Freddie killed the innocent Freddie by sleeping with a man and questioning his sexuality. The innocent Freddie had just begun his life- everything was going great. Freddie and Mary could have gotten married. But the gay Freddie threw it all away. Now, the \"Mama oooh's\" are sung by the straight Freddie. You can tell because there is more emotion there. You can hear the cry for help. The straight Freddie doesn't want to die- he doesn't mean to make his mother cry by going against their beliefs and being gay. I could go on forever.\n\r\nJust by reading the lines as these roles- you can understand. You can see the struggle between two sides. This plays a major role in the opera section. I don't want to type a novel, but it is quite simple to go deep into the song and untie every knot and see what's underneath. Again, there's no proof that any of what any of us are saying is even remotely true- because unfortunately Freddie is not here to unleash the secret of Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\r\nAll we know is that it was a groundbreaking song with a groundbreaking video and a groundbreaking meaning- somewhere deep down. RIP Freddie Mercury- the most amazing, talented song writer, pianist, singer, and person to ever walk the earth. I love you so much and I really do hope that my analysis of your masterpiece was at least a small step toward the true meaning. Thank you for this song and for all of your songs. Because without them I'd be in the same place as you right now. LOVE YOU\n\r\nPS thanks to whoever read this bible of a comment ;)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nTo the guy who links this song to AIDS...End of story?

He describes himself as being only the silhouette of a man, somewhat defenseless and considered a fool (scaramouche) for his choice. The family then demands (thunderbolts and lightning very very frightening) that he shun his desires and rather act straight (do the fandango). But he refuses to play along and requests to be free (mama mia  let me go) as he knows nothing will ever be the same again (stone me and spit in my eye, love me and leave me to die).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nI think this song is definitely not about aids, most likely not about his sexuality, and probably just loosely based on a fake story about a guy who murdered someone.

Freddie's the only one who truly knows exactly what he had in mind while writing this song, so all we can do is guess what he had in mind from all we know about Freddie and his life in 1975. First of all, to get it out there- Freddie has said in an interview I've seen on Youtube, that the song was indeed originally 3 different songs. He said at the last minute, he ran out of time or whatever, and he just said \"what the hell, I'll just throw them all together\". (One of the smartest decisions made in rock n' roll history) Anyway- ya, so this song, even to Freddie- might not make sense. Each portion might make sense- but not when its put all together- because they really don't have to do with eachother. Unless all 3 songs were written with the same topic in mind.\r\n     Anyway- in order to infer what it's about- you have to know where Freddie was at this point in his life. He was 29 years old when he wrote the song in 1975. (He may have begun writing it in 1974 because it is very complicated)During that time he was very confused. He had been dating his girlfriend of 6 years- Mary Austin, and he was living with her. But Freddie always still looked at guys. He started staying out later- and Mary actually thought he was cheating on her with another woman. What she didn't know was that he was cheating- but with a man.Freddie loved Mary, but was very confused and always still thought about being gay, or bisexual. So he admitted to mary about seeing the other man and he said \"I think i'm bisexual\". Mary replied with, \"No I think your gay. And I understand, and I hope we can stay friends\". And with that, they did until 16 years later when Freddie passed away.\r\n     Saying that- I'm assuming the song was written, or he at least he begun to write it- before the breakup with Mary. That's when he was the most scared and confused. After the breakup he was relieved and free- they were still friends, and he got to have gay sex. So I dont think he would write so dramatically and sadly and confusing if everyhting had already been resolved.\r\n     K- now that you know how he felt, I don't think it's too hard. The very beginning- \"Is this the real life..\" just shows how confused he was. How did this happen? \"No escape\". \"I need no sympathy\" (probably for cheating)Then he goes onto the \"mama\" section. I think of \"Mama\" as Mary. And I think of the \"man\" as Freddie's old happy straight self. Think about it- \"Mary, I just killed my nice, loving, never cheats, straight, self.\"(By cheating on the other man) \"Mary, my life had just begun (he was only in his 20's- he was with girls for less than a decade)But now I've gone and thrown it all away\". Then he goes onto say that its \"too late\", his old self is already gone. He has to just \"face the truth\". ANd that he doesnt want his old self to be gone- he wants to be straight and he wants to be with Mary. (\"I dont want to die\") And that sometimes he wishes that he was never even born in the first place.\r\n     Next is the opera section- which I think is meant to just show how confused he was. It literally makes no sense- besides the \"let me go\". Obviously, let me go from this situation, let me go back to who I was.\r\n     After this comes the Hard rock section. This is where he gets the anger out. He may have wrote this song (remember they were all seperate) after the breakup. I dont know why he'd be angry with Mary, he always loved her. Maybe e is acting as Mary speaking to himself. That is what mary would say right? \"You think you can love me and leave me to die?\" \"Can't do this to me!\" \"Just gotta get outta here!\"\r\n     Finally, the mock opera ballad descends to where it started. \"Anyway the wind blows\" Meaning I dont care, it doesnt matter to me.\r\n     K- so this was just my opinion- i think it makes sense, right? Like it! :):)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\nThe commonly accepted interpretation for this song is that the singer/narrator has committed a murder, was trialed and sentenced to execution. This makes sense and is supported by the ballad at the beginning of the song.\n\nI thought that, perhaps the man he has killed is, in fact himself. He has made a bad decision, but then regrets that choice immediately and wondered if what had happened was real. This choice completely ruined his life. Throughout the whole song he repeated 'Nothing matters\" and \"Any way the wind blows\". The second phrase isn't literal, of course (At least in my interpretation).

I think that isn't a mistake but rather the most unique quality of this masterpiece. The audience defines what the music means because there is no one way to take it. I think the general idea is that it's about killing something in some way and going through denial and shock.\n\r\nThis song relates to me because when you hurt something you feel lost and dreamlike and you can't believe what you've done. you can't escape from reality and it will follow you for the rest of your life. There are many things you can do to cope like turning to family (mama, i just killed man) or listening to music (fandango) or looking up at the stars to think (gallileo, an astronomer i believe). but no matter what you do you will be haunted and most likely suffer for your wrong doing. when i hurt someone i loved i felt lost in my own twist of fate and i couldn't get out for a while, i struggled ( i need to get right out of here). i went to prison for two weeks (it's the law, no we will not let you go) and i felt like i was going to go to hell (beezlebub has a devil put aside for me)\n\r\ni feel that bohemian rhapsody describes each of our own lives, which doesn't matter to anyone of you because we don't live the same lives. thanks for listening and lettin me share though\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_19": "\ni have heard that this song is partially based on, or at least received inspiration from, a story told within the novel \"My Antonia.\" In the novel, a poor mother and daughter who own a hotel are in desperate need of money. when a wealthy man stays in their hotel, they kill him and take his money. after they do this, they realize that the man was actually the mother's long-lost son, and the sister's brother, who made a fortune for himself. they end up killing themselves because they are too distraught to carry on. not positive this is correct, but it makes sense given the themes in the song, and the fact that it is called \"bohemian rhapsody.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_20": "\nI am pretty certain that this is about his struggle with coming to terms about his homosexuality. \n\r\nFirst of all, \"Bohemian\" means people with unconventional ways of life.. which could be homosexuality... and \"Rhapsody\" means \"A disconnected series of sentences or statements composed under excitement, and without dependence or natural connection; rambling composition.\" Bohemian Rhapsody is noted for it's unique composition. \n\r\nDuring this time in Freddie's life, he had cheated on his longtime girlfriend Mary with a guy and he admitted to her that he is gay. I bet he felt an enormous amount of guilt... similar to the guilt that is expressed in Bohemian Rhapsody. The song provides an insight into Mercury's emotional state at the time, \"living with Mary ('Mamma', as in Mother Mary) and wanting to break away ('Mamma Mia let me go').\n\r\nFreddie has said that if he revealed what Bohemian Rhapsody really meant, he would be spoiling it.

Dr Robert Gallo announce the discovery of AIDS to the public 1984, Bohemian Rhapsody charted in 1975. The song is clearly about someone imprisoned for murder, facing the death penalty, reflecting on mortality, but it did not start out that way. The origin of the song goes back to Freddy's student days in the 1960s.      \nTim Staffell was a member of the group Smile with Brain May and Roger Taylor, the precursor of Queen. Tim Staffell was also a college friend of Freddy Mercury in the late sixties, he says, there was an early version of the song then that was just a collection of bits and pieces, that Freddy and Tim referred to as, \"That cowboy song.\" \nIf you have ever seen early black and white silent movies, where they used to play music on the piano to go along with the film, you will recognise the steccato piano part from silent movies of westerns.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_23": "\nFor the most part, I think this song is about a boy who commits a murder, and is sentenced to execution for it, but I also see the possiblity of it being about a boy who commits suicide.\n\nThe beginning line \"is this the real life, is this just fantasy?\" could be after he has committed suicide, and is experiencing the after life. This also shows with \"look up to the skies and see,\" which could be talking about heaven.\n\nWhen he says he killed a man, he could be talking about himself in third person. It's obvious he wasn't thinking before he pulled the trigger, and feels guilty for leaving his mother behind.\n\nThen he talks about leaving everyone behind, and facing the truth could mean his judgment. He also says he doesn't want to die, which could mean that he hasn't faced the fact that he is dead yet. He also wishes that he'd never been born at all, which I'm sure most suicidal people feel. This would also explain his words, \"nothing really matters\"\n\nIn the next scene, It could be God(s) judging him, and sentancing him to hell (which would explain the thunderbolts and lightening, and devil, Bismillah (in the name of God), and what not).\n\nBut that is all a really abstract interpretation.\n\nI think this song was supposed to be pictured like a play, because that's kind of how I picture it in my head. If you take the more obvious interpretation, the main part of the song is the boy pleading to the jury, and the jury not feeling any sympathy for him. This is shown through the many different voices, and the one tiny voice supporting him is probably his lawer (who isn't doing much, if you ask me.) \n\nScaramouch means cowardly buffoon (or rascal/scamp).\nFandango means to do a foolish or useless thing\nBeelzebub is another word for the Devil\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_24": "\nI haven't read all (nearly 1,000) of the comments on the meaning of this song, so 1 or more people may have already mentioned what I have to say.  FM would never discuss the song's meaning himself or offer an interpretation.  And since the other members of the band seemed to feel that the lyrics related to FM's personal experiences, they never really offered interpretations either.  But of all the possible ways to view the lyrics that I've seen, my favorite two are pasted below, for what they're worth.\n\r\nThis was from a BBC piece on the band: \"When the band released a Greatest Hits cassette in Iran, a leaflet in Persian was included with translation and explanations. In the explanation, Queen states that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like Faust, sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God in Arabic, \"Bismillah,\" and with the help of angels, regains his soul from Shaitan.\"\n\r\nAnd here's the only direct comment I've ever seen that Freddie personally offered about the lyrics:  \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of those songs which has such a fantasy feel about it.  I think people should just listen to it, think about it, and then make up their own minds as to what it says to them \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Bohemian Rhapsody didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just come out of thin air.  I did a bit of research although it was tongue-in-cheek and mock opera.  Why not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Freddie Mercury  [Davis, Andy (1993). \"Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody\". Record Collector (167): 20]\n\r\nFYI.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_25": "\nI heard somewhere that, when asked what this song was about, Freddy Mercury said he didn't know what it was about, which I think means that they were kind of fantastical lyrics that represent a surreal kind of life. It doesn't necessarily mean it's about how he had AIDS. It could be just me, but FM should be remembered by being in one of the best bands ever (in my opinion), instead of dying of AIDS.\n\nNo matter what it means though I like the melody and the singing. Good song!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_26": "\nWell I actually have a different interpretation. Relating to who he was as a person, rather than the protagonist of the song. Not saying he actually killed a man, but maybe he killed off a part of him by a sin he committed. This sin somehow sent devils to haunt him (\"Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me - for me - for me\"), with beelzebub being one of the more powerful devils, also called \"The lord of the flies\".\n\nWhat is surprising though is the word \"Bismillah\", which literally translates \"In the Name Of Allah\" (In the name of God). So the line\n\n\"Easy come easy go will you let me go\n(Bismillah no we will not let you go) let him go\"\n\nMeans, he is asking \"In he name of Allah\", to let him go, or remove these devils from me. But the response was \"No\". Probably because of his sin earlier in the song. \n\nThis song is deep simply because it touches on hollywood's association with devils and selling your soul to achieve fame. It touches mortal sins, devils, God and the consequences of siding with either.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_27": "\nIn short terms what Bohemian Rhapsody is really about: \n\nIts truly about Freddie himself struggeling with his religion and his mum, who is deeply faithfull in their religion (Zoroastrianism). It's about losing his religion and maybe his beloved mum, because he can't go on with all their principles anymore. Maybe his mum would shun him when being disfellowshipped like common in many other cults. \"Mama, I just killed a man. Put a gun against his head\" is definitly about killing his old religous personality. Now \"life has just begun\" and he can go on living on his own! \n\nA few days ago i recognized this myself when i heard the song.

In the explanation, Queen states that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like Faust, sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God in Arabic, \"Bismillah\", and with the help of angels, regains his soul from Shaitan.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_37": "\nThis is the story of a murderer who is being arrested in his mother's home. Along the way we see the story unfold, his tortured thoughts and the mother's grief.\n\nIt begins with his realization and awakening to what he has done. He can't believe what has just happened, everything feels surreal. But slowly and surely he comes to accept his fate and chooses that whatever may come, he will go with it.\n\nIn the next set of events, he is presumably at his mother's home, telling her what has come. Having run away from the crime scene, he has sought shelter from the authorities, at least briefly to tell his mother what may happen to him. From this alone we can assume that his mother must mean a lot to him, and him to her, if he felt she was the first person he should tell. And so he bids his mother farewell and that she should not worry about him.\n\nThe authorities arrive and he makes his last bidding farewell to any loved ones who are present. And in the moments leading up to his full arrest, he cries out to his mother. It is not known whether this is a mental or physical event. I'd like to think physical, for dramatic effect.\n\n\"I see a little silhouetto of a man\nScaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango\nThunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me\nGallileo, Gallileo,\nGallileo, Gallileo,\nGallileo Figaro - magnifico\"\n\nThis entire paragraph is his tortured thoughts between feeling small, and the different voices in his head and it is loud and thunderous and confused and just very frustrated. On one side you have his cowardice urging itself to dance tonight, so to speak. Whilst on the other hand you have his philosophical side fighting for precedence by trying to keep him nihilistic and calm: that \"nothing really matters.\" And judging by the \"magnifico!\" we can assume that his philosopher's side is winning or that he's fighting for this side to win.\n\nThe authorities have put him in chains and are leading him away. But the beauty about this piece of poetry is, it's not only his mother's plea to the authorities begging for her son (\"Let him go!\"), it is also his tortured existence between light and darkness at the same time! So we see that the authorities represent the evil inside him, but we also see the light trying to spark the good in him. \"Bismillah!\" meaning \"In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\" is shouted to try and keep him from falling to the depths of the void \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which can also be seen as the authorities sort of saying \"Oh for God's sake, woman, we won't let him go\". And \"We will not let you go\" is not only the authorities saying they must take him in, it is the darkness dragging him down to the depths of hell. This is why you get the \"Beezlebub has a devil put aside for me\" which makes no sense on the authorities behalf, but paints the picture of his thoughts.\n\nAs they lead him away, his mother expresses her heartfelt distress. She cries out heavily, and once again it is unknown whether it is mental or physical. I like to think it's mental thoughts, but she is just breaking down and other loved ones are supporting her as she collapses. You know...for dramatic effect.\n\nAnd as he walks away, we see who has won the battle in his mind. It is the philosopher who won, and there is no more time to be a coward, he has to walk his fate now. You hear it in the music tune too. That all the thunder and lightning has gone, and he has completely succumbed, this is why it sounds calm.\n\nSo we see it's three songs at once. One about a man being arrested on charge of murder. One about a man's thoughts after killing another man. One about a son and mother's connection.\n\nThis is one godly sad song...\n\n\n\n\n...Alexa play Despacito!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_38": "\nI think it is fairly obvious that this song is about Freddie's struggle with his sexuality.  The beginning verse is about accepting reality.  The second and third verses are about him shedding the lie of being straight and him coping with the consequences/stigma of being gay.  The operatic section is about him facing judgement for who he is.  The heavy metal section is about him defying his judges.  The last section is almost a melancholy acceptance of who he is.  He doesn't necessarily like it, but it is his fate.  Any way the wind blows....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_39": "\nI think it is most likely about Freddie discovering his gay feelings.

It is one of the first pieces of existential literature and because of that we had to read it in English class.  Personally, I never cared for it that much, but it is certainly a major peice of literature.  I think this song is based on this book.\n\r\nThe book is basically about a man who no longer finds anything meaningful in life.  It starts off with the death of his mother, and his relationship with her is a major motif throughout the book.  Half way through the book, he shoots and kills a man for no really good reason.  Since he has no meaning in his life, he doesn't seem to have that much remorse for what he did.  The remainder of the book is him getting caught (doesn't try to avoid it), waiting for his trial and the emotions he goes through.  In the end, he still cannont find any meaning in life, so he doesn't really care what happens to him.  (Mr. Camus, pardon me for butchering your novel with such a brief interpreation of it).\n\r\nAnyway, as you can see, there are a LOT of similarities and common motiffs between the song and the novel.  The first part of the song is about him killing the man (notice Freddy never says why, and the character in the book also shot his victim).  Although Freddy makes it sound like the mother is alive, I think this still may work because I don't believe the character in the book ever really accepted his mother's death.  He never really grieved about it.\n\r\nThe second portion of the song represents the trial. Freddy increases the tempo here, representing the fuss and fury society makes regarding the murder.  Notice the murderer in the song doesn't say much in his own defense (\"I'm just a poor boy, no body loves me\" and then \"Easy come easy go.  Will you let me go?\").\n\r\nThe next part of the song represents the anger the murderer feels at being judged.  Notice he never feels sorry for what he did, just angry that others are judging him for it and that they don't see things from his point of view, that it doesn't really matter what he did because life has no meaning.\n\r\nAnd then the song ends with The same line he uses throughout the song \"Nothing really matters\" which is at the core of Existentialism.\n\r\nI'm sure not everyone on this message board has read The Stranger, but because it was such an important work, I think it highly likelly that Freddy did, and I wonder if it is the basis for this song.  I would love to hear from others who have read (or had to read) The Stranger and hear what they think.\n\r\n-Dhaval\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_106": "\noh, and \"Bismilah\" works because The Stranger takes place in Algeria.\n\r\n(Bismilah = In the name of Allah)\n\r\n-Dhaval\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_107": "\nI've been a major Queen fan since i was a kid and this song obviously shook the foundations of rock upon its release.

He said \"It's just a bunch of rhyming nonsense.\" :-)\n\r\nWhen the single was first ready for release, it seems that his producers told Freddie that Bo Rhap was too long coz most songs in the late 70's were like 2-3 mins tops and told him no radio station would play a song 6 mins long in its entirety. Freddie was asked to edit it and make it shorter.\n\r\nFreddie then secretly passed the single to a DJ fren of his and told him that this was his new single and wanted to knoe what his fren thought abt it. The DJ dude played it 48 times in 2 days. All 5min 54 sec of it.

My take on this is almost a religious one:\r\nThe intro is born out of classical music.  As far as lyrics go, they lay out the setting and hero for this story.  This is somewhere between heaven and earth and its all happening to this one poor boy.\r\nNow we get the story.  This man has killed a person, and now he has regret for it.  He's dying on earth and needs forgiveness from life before he goes.  Unfortunately, his mom doesn't give him his satisfaction and he ends up killing himself.\r\nAn amazing guitar solo brings us to purgery.  Here all the angels fight over this poor boy and where he should be sent.\r\nAs stated before - Bismillah is In the Name of Allah...so basically it means - In the name of God no! we will not let you go...get the drift?\r\nOk finally we come to beelzebub...uh oh the devil! Now we know where this boy spends eternity.\r\nHeavy metal guitar can only mean brimstone...haha.  Now this guy tells us what he thinks of hell, purgery, life...everything!   Obviously he doesn't like it - so you think you can spit in my eye? love me and leave me to die? He hasn't had quite the best experiences nor been dealt the best cards.\r\nSo what does he do?  He's getting out of here!\r\nSuddenly we hear some of the most regal sounding guitar in the interlude between.  This is almost a call from heaven...the might face of god descending upon this poor soul.  God judges him...and he's right back in hell.\r\nSeeing that the big man even rejects him, he looses all hope and faith in everything.  Nothing matters.  Any way the wind blows....\r\n This is the basic story of a criminal going from life to death and all the stages after that.\r\nOf course I could be wrong...it could really have no meaning at all.\n\r\nOne final interpretation is like Mercury said...it's a song about relationships. I'm not really sure what kind of relationships he meant, but I'm gonna go with romantic ones just for the hell of it. Suddenly in love - is this the real life? is this just fantasy? Once again laying out the setting, this time it can be looked at much more lightheartedly. As for the killed a man part...you got me there?!? But when he goes all suicidal...the relationships failing. In the opera section its the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other...what on earth does this guy do? Love me and leave me to die? - I think hes kinda pissed. \r\n But then again...love is kind of a trap and he realizes he's stuck there. Life is only a second out of eternity...and so suddenly nothing really matters.\n\r\ni'm sorry on behalf of him for his rambling \n\n\n\n\n", "comment_117": "\noh yea... and he meant \"purgatory\" not \"pergury\" which isn't even a word\n\n\n", "comment_118": "\nhear a great version of this song by one awesome band (listen to the rest of their stuff too- it rocks!) - The B-sides!!\r\n     they rock my world!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_119": "\nno one deserves to cover this song\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_120": "\nfreddy told me it was about him being homosexual and that his mother was a devout catholic and he thought if she found out, she would think he would be condemed to hell. so it is about him being gay and how that made him dead in his mothers eyes, and condemned by religion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_121": "\nburp15 u r retarded freddy was dead before wayne's world was even thought of???????\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_122": "\nLove this song......always have and always will...and anyone who doesnt is crazy\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_123": "\nHey guys,\n\r\ni think that this song is about the struggle of nazi germany. seeing as i thought germany should have won WW2 my interpretation of the lyrics are better that the rest.

I am not about to call myself a hardcore fan, but I like Queen.  What I have heard of Queen, that is.  That does not make me a sheep, it just makes me somewhat uneducated in the subject.  Either way, it makes little difference.\n\r\nAlso, in response to WoahNightfall (all the way up there, bear with me, I did read every post), the AIDS epidemic was diagnosed, and research began, in 1980, as an indirect result of the ebola outbreak in Africa in 1979.  The disease was first known as GRID, or Gay-Related Immuno Disease, but protests changed the name.  For that matter, the first diagnosed case was not in America.  It was in France, in 1980, as I said.  Unlike most others, I will divulge the source of my information:  \"And the Band Plays On.\"  An HBO documentary-movie.  Quite educational.

That is just disrespectful to real Queen fans, to the memory of Freddie Mercury, and to music in general.  Sure, Bohemian Rhapsody is an awesome song, and it makes for a good song to freak people out with on the road.  However, I am not so arrogant as to blindly say that this is, without a doubt, the best Queen song ever, when I have not even heard 1/20th of their music.   So I am a causal fan.  Nothing wrong with that.  And you are right, music has degraded somewhat, but everybody has their moments.  In fact, I like Linkin Park because I can relate, and unlike most of the preppy idiots who put them on repeat for so long it drives me insane, I heard their music long before many others.

Hmm.\n\r\n Next, AIDS? do come now! Innuendo, Mr. Bad Guy (Freddie's solo effort), and Miracle are more likely to be about aids considering they were written and released very close to his death. \r\nNext, Queen music is greatly about religion, mostly Freddie's and Brian's, just look at the Album's Queen, and Queen II. Freddie was Zoroastrian, which is a persian faith based on balance (paralells to Star Wars as well) The first two albums are almost entirely about it, i won't into details now, but if any one has questions bring them up, maybe i'll have more time later. So for now i'll give you the crash course on Boh Rhap. now for all of you zealous people on here that will get upset because you don't agree just listen, and this isn't what the whole song means either, or any of the songs, just plenty of parallels. \r\nIn Zoroastrianism there are two main dieties, Ahura and Angra (the exact spellings are subject to translation) or in a different approach \"Phoenix\" and \"Lilly\", Phoenix was the god of good, and Lilly the opposing force. Freddie saw all of this in himself, and considered himself the Phoenix, in his life's \"fairy tale\" (not the phoenix of the universe, mind you) this song appears (through my research) to be apart of the \"cosmic battles\" of the Zoroastrian faith. The opposing forces are seen in Bohemian Rhapsody, as well as the redemption in the narrators mind, the faith  also believes that after downward spiral the universe will be redeemed by Ahura or Phoenix. \r\nMany of the other interetations seem to be rather close, to the over lying story esp. the one with the shock process, becuase there was an actual event documented in the early 70's that Boh Rhap is supposedly based off of.\n\r\nThis may also be Freddie's auto bio. His religion fits all the better if it is autobiographical.\n\r\nYes, Freddie said he doesn't know what it means, but it was probably just away to get the press and public away from him on this song, it was the same tactic Don McLean Used for American Pie (nothing to do with the movies) to deal with the press.\n\r\nThere, i've suceeded in completely confusing you, I'm sorry, but if I've made any mistake in the religious aspects please tell me, and any question i'll try to answer.\n\r\n-Italian Phaethon\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_149": "\nAlso, why does it sound like an opera? because it is.

He does heroine, or some drug that lets you see things. He of course sees the Devil, and Angels fighting over him. He begs for mercy at the devils and the angels take his side, but they fight way too much, and he cant take it anymore. He runs out of the hideout and just keeps running. When the tempo slows down from the fast paced guitar solo, thats when he is caught. With his mother looking down on him, cause she knew.

The he was playing away and he stopped and he said \"Now dears, this is where the opera section comes in\" and I went oh, my god! So we said, \"Oh OK, this is the opera section\" and it was just gonna be at the time a little brief interlude of a little bit of you know a few little things like Galileos. So we said OK, fine , stick a few little Galileos and then we can get on to like the rock part of the song. It started off as a ballad and then there's the opera section and then it went on and on. As we got into the studio we started formatting the song which we had to record it in sections because it was actually designed in sections, so we recorded it in sections and everything was fine. We did the ballad section and then we did the rock section going back to the ballad section - if you hear the song you understand what I mean. And we left a blank piece of tape to do the opera section. When we started doing the opera section properly, erm, it just got longer and longer and we just kept adding blank tape to this thing and it got bigger and bigger and bigger. Every day we just sort of thought \"Oh, this is it, we've done now\" and Freddie would come in with another lot of lyrics and say \"I've added a few more Galileos here dear\" and so we would put on a few more Galileos and it just got bigger and bigger and bigger and in the end it became the epic we all know.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_215": "\npkjun I think your interpretation is the most logical :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_216": "\n200th post for this song\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_217": "\ndude :D make it 201\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_218": "\nyrs ago pkjun made a great comment. truth is it couldnt be about AIDS as it was originallly written.

He fears death, he gets into the court (heavenly or not..), he turns the truth for his good \"nobody loves me\". Before it was \"I need no sympathy\".

I mean \"baby\" is apparently means a romantic relationship. So he hopes that she takes responsibilty for her actions.

Very sad stuff.  But then there's the scadamoosh.  I no one's really had a good take on that.  It's a trial, yeah, beyond that I think that it's a parody of the court system.  I mean, it's a trial with people telling him to dance the Fan-dan-go.  Think the last court room scene in Chicago, just an all out mockery of courts.  Then, like everyone says, the verdict is in: guilty.  This pisses him off and sends him nuts, i.e. the kick ass guitar solo.  Eventually he accepts his fate.

The mood of this part just doesn't fit any other way.  That's how i picture it anyway.  So whatever happened to him, he doesn't care anymore and has given up.\n\r\nMama just killed a man \r\nPut a gun against his head \r\nPulled my trigger now he's dead \r\nMama, life had just begun \r\nBut now I've gone and thrown it all away \r\nMama \r\nDidn't mean to make you cry. \r\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow \r\nCarry on, carry on \r\nAs if nothing really matters. \n\r\nHe killed someone and is feeling extreme guilt about it.

This part is rather self explanatory (and my favorite part of the song).\n\r\nOK, let's take this next part line by line since it is the most complicated.  He gets caught, and the \"opera\" section is the trial.\n\r\nI see a little silhouetto of a man \r\n(The executioner)\r\nScar-a-mouche, Scar-a-mouche, \r\nWill you do the Fan-dan-go?\r\n(The court is taunting him, calling him a buffoon [scaramouche] and telling him to dance.\r\nThunderbolt and lightning, \r\nvery, very frightening me. \r\n(They are threatening him with the electric chair.)\r\n(Galileo) Galileo \r\n(Galileo) Galileo \r\nGalileo figaro Magnifico \r\n(OK, this part I think was just random filler, maybe mocking the court system, which this whole scene seems to do with it's rediculousness and petty bickering.)\r\nI'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me. \r\nHe's just a poor boy from a poor family. \r\nSpare him his life from this monstrosity. \r\nEasy come, easy go, will you let me go, \r\n(He is pleading to the court, even saying easy come easy go in that there are plenty more living people out there.  This isn't exactly the best argument, but oh well.)\r\nBismillah! No we will not let you go \r\n(Let him go!) \r\nBismillah! We will not let you go \r\n(Let hime go!) \r\nBismillah! We will not let you go \r\n(Let me go!) \r\nWill not let you go \r\n(Let me go!) \r\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no \r\nOh mama mia mama mia \r\nMama mia let me go. \r\n(The big fight, back and forth.)\r\nBielzebub has a devil put aside for me, For me, For me!\r\n(He is found guilty, he knows when he dies he will go to hell.)\n\r\nSo you think you can stone me and spit in my eye. \r\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die. \r\nOh, baby, Can't do this to me, baby, \r\nJust gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here. \r\nHe just gets insanely pissed off that he is guilty and goes berserk.\n\r\nNothing really matters, Anyone can see, \r\nNothing really matters, Nothing really matters to me. \r\nAnyway the wind blows.\r\nA reprise of the beginning, back to where he started.  He just doesn't care even though he knows he is going to be killed.\n\n\r\nSorry for how long winded that sucker was, but thats my interpretation from the beginning and I think it's a damn good one.

Between nine and ten o'clock he described certain circles with his staff and thus conjured up the Devil.\n\r\nFeigning anger at having been summoned against his will, the Devil arrived in the midst of a great storm. After the winds and lightning had subsided the Devil asked Dr. Faustus to reveal his will, to which the scholar replied that he was willing to enter into a pact. The Devil, for his part, would agree: \n\r\nto serve Dr. Faustus for as long as he should live, \r\nto provide Dr. Faustus with whatever information he might request, and \r\nnever to utter an untruth to Dr. Faustus. \r\nThe Devil agreed to these particulars, on the condition that Dr. Faustus would promise: \n\r\nat the expiration of twenty-four years to surrender his body and soul to the Devil, \r\nto confirm the pact with a signature written in his own blood, and \r\nto renounce his Christian faith. \r\nHaving reached an agreement, the pact was drawn up, and Dr. Faustus formalized it with his own blood.\n\r\nHenceforth Dr. Faustus' life was filled with comfort and luxury, but marked by excess and perversion. Everything was within his grasp: elegant clothing, fine wines, sumptuous food, beautiful women--even Helen of Troy and the concubines from the Turkish sultan's harem. He became the most famous astrologer in the land, for his horoscopes never failed. No longer limited by earthly constraints, he traveled from the depths of hell to the most distant stars. He amazed his students and fellow scholars with his knowledge of heaven and earth.\n\r\nHowever, for all his fame and fortune, Dr. Faustus could not revoke the twenty-four year limit to the Devil's indenture. Finally recognizing the folly of his ways, he grew ever more melancholy. He bequeathed his worldly goods to his young apprentice, a student named Christoph Wagner from the University of Wittenberg .\n\r\nShortly after midnight on the last day of the twenty-fourth year, the students who had assembled at the home of the ailing Dr. Faustus heard a great commotion. First came the sound of a ferocious storm and then the shouts--first terrifyingly loud then ever weaker--from their mentor.\n\r\nAt daybreak they ventured into his room. Bloodstains were everywhere. Bits of brain clung to the walls. Here they discovered an eye, and there a few teeth. Outside they found the corpse, its members still twitching, lying on a manure pile.\n\r\nHis horrible death thus taught them the lesson that had escaped their master during his lifetime: to hold fast to the ways of God, and to reject the Devil and all his temptations.\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nThis is pretty much of what it means, but this charater was not limited to just one writer: Goethe, Berlioz and Marlowe had different dipictions of the man and his demise!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_320": "\nWhat?

It evoked so much emotion. At first I'd want to cry and then I'd want to headbang. It's just such a crazy song... but don't get me wrong- crazy in a good way. \n\r\nAnyway, to all the people who think this song is about AIDS, and the leader singer of Queen, Freddie Mercury's, battle with the immune defiency disease- this is quite frankly- out of the picture. See, Mercury was diagnosed in the late 80's of AIDS (though he kept it as a secret for a while), and this song was written in the mid 70's (I think '76). So clearly, he couldn't have written about his struggle with the disease, if he didn't even know he had it. \n\r\nAnyways, this is a magnificent song. Period. End. Of.

Also i think that there is a huge astrological/galileo emphasis throughout this song. Notice the first line is 'open your eyes look up to the skies and see', he's comparing his discovery that he is gay to galileo realising that the earth isn't the physical centre of the universe. They were both left with the choice of whether they hid what they knew to be true or reveal it and both of them went public with it and risked being crucified for saying the truth.\r\nAlso galileo is linked in by a big italian theme in the song not just in the middle section but earlier, notice he says 'mama' which is italian and links to the opera theme which is also italian.\n\r\nHowever i was actually most interested in this rather interesting relevation about the first line. There are three voices singing and the two loudest appear to be saying:\r\n\"Is this the real life/is this just fantasy\"\r\nbut the third very clearly says\r\n\"Is this the real life/is this just Battersea\"\r\nI'm not joking, listen for it and you'll hear it.\n\r\nBattersea of course adds a new meaning because in the early 1900s it was home to the most radical liberal politics in all of britain, and considering britains position at that time the whole world. The famous Brown Dog affair occured when a scientist decided to sue another researcher for vivisection (killing animals in experiments) he lost the case, but raised so much publicity that a national paper raised what would now amount to over a million pounds, part of this was spent on repaying the damages the scientist had to pay, the rest was spent on constructing a massive bronze statue/fountain of a dog. \r\nNow who looks like a dog? Freddy Mercury does a bit, and in a way he's worried about being dissected and killed by  the media, however the fact is that he would of course be interested in radical liberalism because he was a homosexual in a time when not much was known about it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_399": "\nthe 'devil set aside for me' is probably a reference to how the catholics think that gay people need to be exorcised of their 'gayness'\n\r\n\"Anyone can see, \r\nNothing really matters, Nothing really matters to me\"\r\nclearly ironic after the whole fuss of the song, maybe he's saying that since he's gay people may think he's sub-human, but he's saying that things matter to him as much as they do to anyone.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_400": "\nbattersea dogs home rox\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_401": "\nI have to write an interp of a song for my ap english class, and the whole breaking it into 3 phases thing was really insightful.. good job yall!

The gospels have been proven from secular historians from that time to have been written less than 50 years after his death. All other religions were founded long after the leader died, which allowed a myth to spring up. \n\r\nAlso, Jesus is the only 'God' who has ever died for his people. All other religions work on a principle of legality, i.e. gaining a place in heaven through merit. Christianity is the only religion that dares to tell people that they have failed in what God wanted them to do (so how come it was so readily accepted?) \n\r\nJesus is also the first religious leader to be foretold by several hundred seperate prophecies. The book of Daniel predicts the birth of Jesus to the exact year. Secular historians decided it must have been written after he died, but the Dead Sea scrolls prove it was written about 500 years before he was born.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_470": "\nI may have posted this already, but this song helped me with some English homework...we were meant to be writing a \"spell\" for the witches in Macbeth or something.
