This is my meaning of the song\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nIf you want to. Take my virginity. I should have said it before\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 i tried to hide the urge. Faked the orgasms.  I cant pretend it anymore. I only want to die like this. Never by the hands of a past relationship. I don't want to hear you lie tonight now that we have done this. This is when i want it so bad to happen. I'm in control and stronger. This is when I orgasm. Because nobody can resist this. You went better and deeper. I was on runners high. It hurt baby. This is sin so when we die we are going straight to hell. *moan*. I want to die like this. Never by the hands of an ex. I dont want to hear you lie tonight. Now that ive cummed. This is when i want it but hide it. Im in control. *orgasm* I cant resist it. No more baby ooh. Im sore. Thoughts on your body? You made me alive. You were lethal and made me almost die. In my dreams it felt so damn right but I woke up everytime. This is real. Im on the edge again. Bam. I have to stop now im sore.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
