{"comment_0": "\nOne of the hardest battles an individual can face in life, is the battle with oneself. Grande discusses this in 'Breathin', pointing out the most difficult of mental illnesses-anxiety.\nAs someone who suffers with severe anxiety, and other mental health problems, I get what Ariana was aiming for here. In the wake of the tragic Manchester Arena attacks in 2017, not to mention her personal life regarding her romances, she tells a story of wanting to take a moment and pause. \n'Breathin' is about collecting yourself, understanding that you can find stable ground when the world is falling apart. Realising that you can go back to happier place and reflect on that, and to finally understand that there are certain things in this world that we cannot control, so we have to let go and continue on with the life we have.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
