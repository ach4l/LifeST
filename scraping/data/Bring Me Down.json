{"comment_0": "\nI never really listened to the lyrics of this song until recently. Funny how when you are going through something similiar, the words stick out to you moreso than before.\n\r\nMy take on the song is that she is in love with him but he is only using her/playing her. He knows that no matter how many times he hurts her, she loves him, therefore she will always be there when it's convienent for him. She knows it's wrong to love him and be with him but she just wants him so bad that she feels it's not wrong enough for her to leave. You get me?? It's like, you know that eating a whole bad of dorittos or a whole gallon of ben & jerrys is bad for you and the scale will probably read 5 pounds more in the morning, but you eat it anyway because you just want them/it so bad. It's almost like you'd rather have the little bit of him that he's willing to give you and a side of hurt to go than nothing at all.\n\r\nLove it!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThe unruffled pillow laughing at her trusting heart sounds like he's not sleeping in her bed, which is why \"his\" pillow is unruffled.  Him being gone mocks her trusting him not to leave.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song is so awesome! I love the video... Whenever me and all my girls hear this we break out in tune....Good times....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI love this song!...It is like I hate to love you.I mean to love someone so much no matter what he/she did to you it doesn't matter, and when you try not to love them but you cannot help it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI was wondering if someone could tell me their oppinion of what the song means to them. I have a feeling I know but I can't really make up my mind.\n\r\nI also have a question all you guys that have seen the video (awesome vid) I was wondering if they knew why there are so many of her like in the first part of the vid when she is in the bathroom and she is looking in the mirrow and than another figure of her self shows up by the door. Same thing in the bed room scene, and when she is leaving.\n\r\nAlso do you think at the end of the vid when she is whipeing off the \"I'm Sorry\" is that from the guy the is singing about?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nIt's about a love that brings you down instead of raises you up.  She is struggling with getting away from it, but by letting herself be brought down her heart will be broken.  Getting over love, real love is hard.  Even though she knows it's wrong she lets herself get hurt by it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\n'Six AM unruffled pillow\r\nLaughs out loud at my trusting heart'\r\n'If you would only stay gone\r\nMaybe I could move on'\n\r\nEven though she wants to move on, he always comes back when he needs her and she lets him because she trusts him. Like a pillow, she's there for conveiniance ... something that's always lying around but not always used. Of coarse she goes along with it, but everyone else knows it's a mistake, 'laughs out loud at my trusting heart'.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nMusicQueen :::I think the song is about finding another part of yourself when you go through hard times. {thats why in the vid there are so many of her} & the part where she says  \"you don't appreciate......\"  she's saying theres this part of her that says pick up and move on, that part being her tough side. but her emotional side is saying you don't get it my heart hurts.\r\nBut then again also in the secong half she is speaking to that someone who broke her heart\n\r\n^^just my opinion^^\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nIt reminds me of my ex! no matter how hard i try i can never forget him... and i want 2 b with him so bad! but his heart belongs to someone else now! Life - Love = Worthless!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nIts the love in where the other person the guy breaks your heart. Bt us girls, always go back to them because we care for them to much. like we will be there for them anytime anywhere. Love is truly blind.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nI felt at first this song was about a bad relatioship that just brought you down, but after watching the video I realized it is more specific. I think it is about being love with someone who has an addiction, in the video it seems he is going through withdrawls. At first this song did not hit home but soon after i started dating a recovering herion addict and I listend to it and I understood it on a whole different level. The song is about reaching for someone that is unreachable. \n\r\nAt the beginning of the video she is looking in the mirror and on it are the words im sorry. I think this symbolizes that she is apologizing to herself. I also think that the many different Mirandas in the video symbolize her many conflicted feelings each one represents another emotion. She wants to leave, she wants to stay, she loves him, she hates him, she wants to be strong for him, she wants to be weak with him. As she says the lyrics \"im puttin out the flame\" she also whipes the mirror clean of im sorry. This means she is done apologizing and ready to get out. But then of course she is reminded of his pain and her love for him. As the chorus is playing near the end you see him shaking and smoking a cigarette, while the words break my heart play. This I think is evidence that his addiction is what is breaking her heart. And as she speaks of the pillow, and wishing he was with her, he gets angry and it shows quite a few cigarettes on the table and he is alone. This shows he is struggling with his addiction by himself. At the end when she is circling him with the car I think it symbolizes that she cant get to him only circle around where he is. The fact that she steals his care shows that she is mad at him for everything but has no idea how to express it because he doesnt understand so she resorts to stealing his only way out since he doesnt result to using her as a way out.\n\n\n\r\nSweet like a kiss sharp like a razor blade -THE DESCRIPTION OF THE REALATIONSHIP, ALSO SHE COMPARES IT TO A RAZORBLADE BECAUSE SHE IS CAUSING THE PAIN HERSELF\n\r\nI find you when I\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd m close to the bottom- WHEN SHE IS AT THE BOTTOM IT REMINDS HER OF HIM BECAUSE HE IS ALWAYS AT THE BOTTOM FIGURATIVLY SPEAKING\n\r\nYou cant appreciate the time it takes\r\nTo kick a love I always knew was kind of wrong -SHE ALWAYS KNEW GETTING INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE SO UNHEALTHY WOULD BE PAINFUL AND BEING THERE FOR HIM MAKES IT EVEN HARDER FOR HER TO LEAVE AND SHE KNOWS HE DOESNT APPRECIATE THIS\n\r\nAnd as I\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdm putting out the flame -SHE COMPARES HER LOVE TO A FIRE BECAUSE IT IS SO DANGEROUS AND BEAUTIFUL. SHE HAS FINALLY GIVEN UP ON BEING THERE BECAUSE IT ONLY INCREASES HER LOVE AND IT NEVER FIXES ANYTHING BUT THEN....\n\r\nSomebody brings up you name -SHE HEARS HIS NAME AND WANTS TO BE THE ONE THAT IS THERE FOR HIM BECAUSE SHE LOVES HIM\n\r\nOh oh oh oh\r\nBaby baby baby bring me down- SHE IS TO HIGH SHE CANT BE AS CLOSE TO HIM AS SHE WANTS TO BECAUSE HE IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL EMOTIONALY AND MENTALLY SHE THINKS IF SHE CAN GET LOWER THEIR RELATIONSHIP WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE\n\r\nI want to be right where you are -SHE WANTS TO BE WITH HIM INSTEAD OF HELPING HIM\r\nBaby baby baby bring me down-SHE DOESNT CARE HOW FAR DOWN IT WILL TAKE HER TOO\n\r\nYou can look me in the eye and break my heart- EVEN IF IT BREAKS HER\n\r\nBreak my heart- HE LOVES DRUGS, PARTYING, OR WHATEVER HE USES TO ESCAPE LIFE MORE THAN HER\n\r\nSix AM unruffled pillow -HE ISNT IN HER BED\n\r\nLaughs out loud at my trusting heart -SHE HOPES EVERY NIGHT HE WILL BE BUT HE NEVER IS\n\r\nIt\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bds like I didn\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdt see the penny -THE PENNY SYMBOLYZES HER WISH (MAYBE HAPPINESS)AND SHE NEVER SAW IT SHE ONLY SAW HIM\n\r\nI missed the fountain by a couple yards -THE FOUNTAIN IS THE WAY TO MAKE IT COME TRUE AND SHE MISSED IT SHE IS STUCK BUT HOW EASY IS IT TO THROW A PENNY IN A FOUNTAIN? SHE SOMEHOW DID IT ON PURPOSE\n\r\nIf you would only stay gone \r\nMaybe I could move on- PART OF HER JUST WANTS TO END THE PAIN BUT SHE CANT BECAUSE SHE WANTS SO BADLY FOR THNGS TO WORKOUT AND SHE ALSO CANNOT JUST ABANDON SOMEONE SHE LOVES\n\n\n\n", "comment_11": "\nI wonder if this song is about being in love with a drug addict. The video surely seems to imply this, and that is a guaranteed relationship crash. Heartbreak all the way around.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nI love this song. It's such a deep song and for her to have written it at such a young age - kudos to her! Totally underrated artist and bad ass.\n\n\n"}
