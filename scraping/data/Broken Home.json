{"comment_0": "\nBy the lyrics and my personal view point, I believe that this song is specifically about a teenage girl who's parents are fighting/going through a divorce/in an abusive relationship. From the lyrics \"Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down\" can show that her parents were also abusing her by yelling at her. I believe this song is showing how it is affecting her mental state and how she acts around other people. I believe that this is making her feel isolated, from not just her family, but herself as well. The ending to me feels like she yells at them or something and then tries to commit suicide.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
