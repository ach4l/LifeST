If you dont have it yet, download \"The Warm Up\" asap.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nits a shame cuz the guy actually can rap and write lyrics that actually mean something like the first line:\n\r\n\"Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashing\"\n\r\npussy my passion - staying away from the spotlight, hes unknown\r\nnever been a fan of flashing - cameras, lights, etc. again he stays away from the spotlight..\n\r\nbut the shame is that he clearly has that lupe-like ability to make double meanings and good lyrics but like mainstream rap hes talking about having sex, getting head, all that shit..\n\r\nIf he didnt rap about that and have those fucked up lyrics he would be one of my favorite rappers but damnnn clearly hes probably gonna be famous and people will overlook his crappy lyrics. \n\r\nwhat a shame..\n\n\n\n"}
