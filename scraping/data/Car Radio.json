Basically what I think is that he's using the word pride as more negative as in depression and his sleeve is his wrists where (sorry I couldn't think of a nicer way to say this) he cuts himself which is why his skin is screaming and in this case, his \"car\" is his body.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI ponder of something great\nMy lungs will fill and then deflate\nThey fill with fire\nExhale desire\nI know it's dire\n      My time today\n\nThink about something better than reality.

Everyday is important.\n\nI have these thoughts\nSo often I ought\nTo replace that slot\nWith what I once bought\n'Cause somebody stole\nMy car radio\nAnd now I just sit in silence\n\nHe keeps thinking and thinking about the bad things but knows he should be thinking about happy memories he holds.

His pride can be destroyed by other people, rather than before when he could stay proud no matter who tried to bring him down. His looks remind him of something not beautiful, screaming at him that he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t perfect. His appearance reminds him of people who insult him, which is who he wishes to die. He hates his life and the road he is taking with it. There is nothing to stop his train of terrible thoughts.

He finds that the one thing that connects to everyone is that everyone battles with the idea that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t control their fate. His thoughts are becoming deeper and deeper, as he struggles with the thought of why he was ever born.

In the end, death is peace, so peace conquers. Peace is made up of faith that life will get better. Fear is made of sleep because sleeping is more like hiding from life. You must choose one or the other, because to have faith you must be awake to believe. Once awake, a human thinks. Once thinking, you are alive in the simplest terms.

My thoughts were terrifying when left to their own path, so I needed something to funnel or focus them. Music was that focus. This was when I was in middle school, 2003-2006, so most of what I listened to was Relient K, Switchfoot, and Thousand Foot Krutch. I cannot explain how vital those bands were to me overcoming that struggle. \n\nBut there were days were I couldn't listen to music. Say I forgot to charge my ipod, or I forgot my headphones. I would get my ipod taken away from me by teachers constantly for listening in class. Those days when I didn't have that distraction were brutal. My parents could literally tell what days I didn't have music based on what mood I was in after school.\n\nThis is how I relate to this song. I obviously couldn't drive back then, but sitting in a car alone with my thoughts during that time would have been terrible. That's what I feel like this song is conveying.

For instance, when he claims that his lungs \"fill with fire, exhale desire,\" it can be assumed that the fire is referring to his hopes and dreams, whereas instead of exhaling progress towards those dreams, he only exhales the thought of those dreams.\n\n     When he claims that his time is dire today, he means that the time in each of his days is just too short and he is in need of more time. The \"car radio\" is actually a representation of everything that kept him from following his dreams. However, he feels that he cannot continue in his endeavors, causing him to \"just sit in silence.\" Silence (and synonyms of it) refer to time.\n\n     Past the first chorus, we get a glimpse of how he feels that he cannot hide from his failures. Claiming that his failure to do something with his life keep haunting him, they remind him of who he killed in his dream. He didn't kill someone, instead he killed something, his aspirations died after he wasted all of his life. Instead of him killing his aspirations while he is asleep and dreaming, perhaps it happened because of his daydreaming.\n\n     He goes on to state that he hates the car he's driving, that he hates the life he's living. Deeper into the verse, he reveals that he has to deal with everything that distracted him. Angered by how much he is thinking about this, he contemplates committing suicide, or as he calls it \"pull the steering wheel.\"\n\n     Afterwards, he contemplates life itself. Going really deep into the thought.\n\n    Finally, he contemplates suicide again. Comparing suicide with the number two, he ponders into if suicide would be worth it. Peace versus fear, life versus death. Later saying that his faith is keeping him awake. Trying  to get someone to realize that he is dying, that he needs someone to know that he needs to think.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nI think that the car radio is his faith and hope, and the car he's driving is life.\n\"Somebody stole my car radio\" - Someone broke his heart or hurt him and now he has no faith left.\n\"And now I just sit in silence\" - There is no meaning to life left to Tyler.\n\"I can pull the staring wheel\" - It doesn't really matter if he kills himself because of his lack of motivation.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nI ponder of something great= \" I go to seek a Great Perhaps.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_19": "\nwith this song I believe, you have to read between the line. for example, \"somebody stole my car radio,\" he isn't talking about a car or even a radio. the car is his life, and don't you think a radio would make a car \"come to life?\" Some one took his will to keep going, one could say they took his soul.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_20": "\nHey friends :) Thank you all  sharing your thoughts and, ultimately, bearing your souls to one another.

(For me, that's faith in Christ, the ultimate hero over fear.)\r\n- Faith=to be awake\r\n  To be awake=to think\r\n  To think=to be alive \r\n- THE ARTIST'S MAIN POINT IS TO USE ALL HE HAS (every song, every word, every breath; to the point it feels like he's dying from pouring himself out so hard) TO REMIND YOU, YES YOU, FRIEND, TO KEEP ON LIVING.

My Car Radio was stolen from me when I was 10 and I want to Replace That Slot With What I Once Bought Cause Somebody Stole My Car Radio And Now I just Sit In Silence\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_41": "\nCar= Life \nCar Radio= Heart\nSteering Wheel= Trigger of a gun\n\nThats how I see it\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_42": "\n\"I ponder of something great\nMy lungs will fill and then deflate\nThey fill with fire, exhale desire\nI know it's dire my time today\"\n\nHe is thinking introspectively and getting worked up about what he is thinking, realizing his time today isn't good.\n\n\"I have these thoughts, so often I ought\nTo replace that slot with what I once bought\n'Cause somebody stole my car radio\nAnd now I just sit in silence\"\n\nHe has these deep over thinking thoughts so much he wants to fill the void. His void was the car radio. Now that it is stolen, he has to reflect on his thinking. The sitting in silence line is his distraction from his thoughts being gone. \n\n\"Sometimes quiet is violent\"\n\nThe car radio being the distraction tool, plays noise, so without the noise, it is quiet. It being quiet, leaves him in his rough thoughts. \n\n\"I find it hard to hide it\nMy pride is no longer inside\nIt's on my sleeve\nMy skin will scream reminding me of\nWho I killed inside my dream\"\n\nHis dignity is starting to fade and his flaws are appearing on the surface. His thoughts are of introspection of who he is. He is seeing his flaws come out more  and every little thing he has ever done that is bad, like killing someone is making him grow self loathe, even if the killing was in a dream and not in real life. \n\n\"I hate this car that I'm driving\nThere's no hiding for me\nI'm forced to deal with what I feel\nThere is no distraction to mask what is real\nI could pull the steering wheel\"\n\nHe hates who he is and the life that he is living, representing the car. Without the distraction he has to deal with his emotions. There is nothing to disregard reality. He then says he could crash the car by pulling the wheel, representing killing himself. \n\n\n\"I ponder of something terrifying\n'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind\"\n\nNow he ponders in a darker trance than before, since his distraction his gone, like the sound of the radio. \n\n\"I find over the course of our human existence\nOne thing consists of consistence\nAnd it's that we're all battling fear\nOh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here\nOh my, too deep, please stop thinking\nI liked it better when my car had sound\"\n\nHe is saying humans battle the fear of the unknown, which causes lots of thinking. He liked it better when he had his distraction. \n\n\"There are things we can do\nBut from the things that work there are only two\nAnd from the two that we choose to do\nPeace will win and fear will lose\"\n\nNow the narrator is saying to overcome this thinking we have to choose between having peace with life because the fear will keep us thinking, and eventually killing ourselves.  \n\n\"It is faith and there's sleep\nWe need to pick one please because\nFaith is to be awake\nAnd to be awake is for us to think\nAnd for us to think is to be alive\"\n\nThe narrator says either we have faith in life or just ignore everything and sleep. He then leads to why faith is important to being alive and thinking.\n\n\"And I will try with every rhyme\nTo come across like I am dying\nTo let you know you need to try to think\"\n\nThe narrator says it is important to think, unlike before when his thoughts were covered by a distraction. \n\n\"And now I just sit in silence\"\nNow he just stays in his thoughts.\n\nSymbols: Car - Himself, His Body\n              Car Radio- Distraction, Possibly Drugs, \n\nTheme: The theme of this song is that we use distractions to avoid our thoughts and clouded mind.\n\nPurpose: The purpose of this song is that we need to choose peace over fear in deep thoughts, but we need to think too. He believes if we choose to have faith in the thoughts of why we are here and life questions, we are choosing to think over sleeping and not caring. \n\nOverall a good song and this is just my interpretation :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_43": "\nIt seems like he is using 'car radio' as a metaphor for his true self. He says someone stole his car radio: he stole his true self, like he became someone different and got rid of the old him. And when he says 'Who I killed inside my dream' kinda seems like he is saying that because he became someone else, his wishes faded away. 'I hate this car I'm driving' is that he hates himself for becoming someone else. When he talks about 'distraction', he is saying that there is no way to hide that he is someone else. But then from 'There are things we can do' to 'To let you know you need to try and think' seems like he is trying to bring the old him back and get help, but then after that, he goes back to the new him that he hates. \"I ponder of something great' to 'I know its dire my time today' kinda says that with every breath he takes in, he wants help, but with every breath he exhales, he can't bring himself to call out for help.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_44": "\nSo i have listened to this song over and over and over trying to figure out the true meaning behind this song. The way i portrayed it is that this song is not about someone stealing this guy's car radio. Imagine this, the car is his life, the car radio was his girlfriend. Someone came and stole his car radio (his girlfriend) therefor he does not have a distraction of the realism and the fear of the world around him. He doesn't like the car he's driving (the life he is leading) because he can not hide behind his distraction anymore. Because he does not have his distraction he is going crazy because he is thinking and pondering in silence too much. He seems depressed. Part of the chorus is: I have these thoughts, so often I ought\r\nTo replace that slot with what I once bought\r\n'Cause somebody stole my car radio\r\nAnd now I just sit in silence\n\r\nWhat i got from that is he is overthinking everything and thinking too often. He wants to replace his girlfriend (which is the car radio that was in the slot) with something he once bought (maybe he feels that he bought or deserved her by the things he had done to have her as his girlfriend?). But since someone has stole his girlfriend all he can do is sit and silence and over think.\n\r\nThat is my portrayal of these lyrics and maybe because its a fear of mine in my own life. You never know. O.o \r\nI think it makes sense though\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_45": "\nMaybe this is just me as a huge Jesus-freak but is this song not about God/religion? \nI ponder of something great\nMy lungs will fill and then deflate\nThey fill with fire, exhale desire\nI know it's dire my time today\nI see this part as being a Godly revelation. For anyone who hasn't experienced one these lyrics totally describe it. Of course in thinking about God, your gonna be think about something that is great and over your head and it sometimes seems hard to breathe. Most religions relate the burning love for GOD a fire and as desirable. It becomes apparent you could die at any moment. \n\"Sometimes quiet is violent\nI find it hard to hide it\nMy pride is no longer inside\nIt's on my sleeve\"\nI like this part because in my religion, being Catholic Christian, we are taught that we should not be proud of accomplishments and not speak of them unless absolutely necessary. When we sin, it can usually be based on pride and we bear it on our \"sleeves.\" \n\"My skin will scream reminding me of\nWho I killed inside my dream\nI hate this car that I'm driving\"\nI think this part is kind obvious at least to me and I'm sure others. He is talking about hating that he wants to kill himself and how it is making him live his life. \n\"There's no hiding for me\nI'm forced to deal with what I feel\nThere is no distraction to mask what is real\nI could pull the steering wheel\"\nA lot of times I avoid the quiet with God because I know He is going to ask something big from me and I don't want to do it. So I hide it with distractions, music, TV, homework anything, just to get away from it. But then quiet hits you. You can't find anymore hiding places just quiet. Then right at first for me, I just want to die. Die so that I don't have to do it. Yes this is quite morbid but this is the first time I know and can explain it do to this song(thank you 21 pilots). \n\"And it's that we're all battling fear\"\nWhen I get to this point of finally listening and I hear an answer I do literally think: \n\"Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking\" \nand it's hard not to run away again but it is so tempting because\n\"There are things we can do\nBut from the things that work there are only two\nAnd from the two that we choose to do\nPeace will win and fear will lose\nIt is faith and there's sleep\nWe need to pick one please because\nFaith is to be awake\nAnd to be awake is for us to think\nAnd for us to think is to be alive\nAnd I will try with every rhyme\nTo come across like I am dying\nTo let you know you need to try to think\"\nAnd here we are again...talking about faith and the ever present thought of sleep whether literally(actually sleeping your whole life away so you won't have to deal with the questions and problems of everyday.) or metaphorically sleeping(death-whether natural or killing yourself). Peace(GOD) will win. Fear(Devil or ourselves or maybe the latter) will lose. He says that choosing to be awake is to be alive and to be alive is to think. I think he's trying to say choose to listen, to be aware of what God is telling us and then he even states \"you need to try to think\" not cover it up with music. But that doesn't mean music is bad, just don't let it take the GOD'S Place in your life.\nThen he says he needs to replace the slot...which I think means the slot being either religion and breaking free from it or(because I am religious) replacing what your false God was, being maybe the music from the radio. \n\nAnd this could totally all be false in the writer's opinion or possibly it is true. But what matters is it means something to me. Although he says it is only from the incident of getting his car radio stolen I don't think this is completely true because it has to be deeper than him being emo about the simple things in life:)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_46": "\nPersonally, I believe this song is full of symbolism. I view the Car as someone's physical life, driving on and on. The Car Radio could represent happiness or a distraction from what's going on in life. \"Pulling the steering wheel\" could be a suicide reference. I just see this song basically saying \"When the happiness is removed from my life, I still have to keep going and face my fears and problems.\" This song is enriched with brilliant quotes, but the symbolism seems really deep for me. I know interviews with the lead singer explain that the song is totally literal with no symbolism, but I seem to interpret it different.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_47": "\n   The meaning of this song isn't about him killing someone and having to live with it (hence the \"in my dream\"). It's about his car radio being stolen, and sitting in silence without the distraction of the music. He notices that without that distraction he's lonely. He describes the quiet as \"violent\" because he's forced to listen to every thought and emotion.\n\n\n", "comment_48": "\nI think that the focus of the song is literally about his car radio being stolen but with a deeper meaning as well, He says \n\n\"There's no hiding for me\nI'm forced to deal with what I feel\nThere is no distraction to mask what is real\"\n\nto me this song means how hes being forced to deal with his reality instead of finding a distraction from facing reality. Basically His car radio being stolen is forcing him to deal with his emotions and problems. since he no longer has his car radio, he struggles to deal with the amount of thoughts he has, both terrifying and great. he was trouble coping with his own mind.\n\n\"Too deep\nPlease stop thinking\nI liked it better when my car had sound\"\n\nhes also struggling with just simply having his car radio stolen and being forced to sit there in silence which actually is horrible. the music in his car keeps him sane and once he lost it he realized how he was left alone with his thoughts and thats why \"silence is violent\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_49": "\nI think the lyrics \"I could pull the steering wheel\" is another way of saying \"I could kill myself\". The rest of the song is about not having a distraction for thoughts.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_50": "\nOk honestly I got on here to learn about songs and their meanings but I always find myself answering with what I think. I think that's the actual beauty of this band. They create music that allows everyone to experience it in different and deep ways of their own. Which I believe is the true masterpiece in their work. But anyway here's what it means to me.\n\r\nI believe this song talks about how our human minds are always trying to distract us from God and what's really important in this life. I believe the car radio is a car radio or something to symbolize a distraction in our lives. I also think when he talks about his \"time being dire today\" is a reflection on how life is short and how it's important to spread the gospel to as many as possible while we're all here.\n\r\nI also love the part that talks about faith being awake and how we have to pick between sleep and faith and how being awake is to think and thinking is to be alive and I see that in my life. If I wasn't mentally awake to God and I chose to sleep instead and just listen to my car radio I wouldn't be anywhere and I would be doomed after this life. This song talks about how our faith is challenged and how even Christians doubt that they are truly saved and how these thoughts often invade our minds when we aren't distracted. That's just what it meant to me. I love this song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_51": "\nI think that he car radio kind of refers to his ability to think a certain way and how someone stole that so he can't think of the things but instead he has to think of new things and he just can't\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_52": "\nThis is how I interpreted this song. This is mainly because I suffer with panic disorder. It's when I have a panic attack when I overthink too much. This song perfectly represents how I feel inside, and maybe, just maybe, it was what the writers thought as well.\n\nI ponder of something great\nMy lungs will fill and then deflate\nThey fill with fire, exhale desire\nI know it's dire my time today\n\nHe ponders of something great. He forgets all his troubles about these crazy thoughts overcoming him and focuses on just that goal, which fills his lungs. But, these thoughts have returned. It makes him sad again. His lungs deflate. They fill with fire because it is overcoming him. But he needs to exhale desire because he knows this is a test from God. He knows that this disorder is making him want to do things that God forbids. Therefore, he does not do them. And he knows that it's time for his bad thoughts to come today again.\n\nI have these thoughts, so often I ought\nTo replace that slot with what I once bought\n'Cause somebody stole my car radio\nAnd now I just sit in silence\n\nThese thoughts come to him often. Therefore he feels the need to distract him from those thoughts with music. However, his car radio was stolen, and now he sits in silence, with nothing to distract him. \n\nSometimes quiet is violent\nI find it hard to hide it\nMy pride is no longer inside\nIt's on my sleeve\nMy skin will scream reminding me of\nWho I killed inside my dream\nI hate this car that I'm driving\nThere's no hiding for me\nI'm forced to deal with what I feel\nThere is no distraction to mask what is real\nI could pull the steering wheel\n\nYou know how people say \"It's always the quiet ones.\" Well that's exactly what this is. People think that violence is always stabbing, murdering, punching, etc, but not in this case. These thoughts are insanely violent, even if they're only a figment of his imagination. And each day, it's getting harder and harder to hide these thoughts. And his pride is escaping. He no longer feels pride in himself because of how he isn't hiding these thoughts, people are thinking he is selfish. He is not doing the things he used to be doing due to this, and whenever he does, he makes everyone stop doing it just for him to go home because his thoughts made him not able to handle going anywhere or doing anything, therefore everyone thinks he is selfish, even though he cannot help it. And on his sleeve, is his pride. He is scratching his sleeve because it helps relieve the pain, or at least he thinks it does. And he cannot hide anymore. His car radio is gone. There is no distraction, he is forced to face this problem. He needs help and he needs to tell someone about it. And now, there is no distraction to mask what is real. This problem in his head is so severe, he is starting to question the existence of anything. And he could just pull the steering wheel, crash the car, and kill himself, and it could be all over. No pain anymore. But he won't. Notice how he says he \"can\" pull the steering wheel. He knows God doesn't want him to kill himself, so he is continuing to live, because he knows it's a test.\n\nI ponder of something terrifying\n'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind\nI find over the course of our human existence\nOne thing consists of consistence\nAnd it's that we're all battling fear\nOh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here\nOh my, too deep, please stop thinking\nI liked it better when my car had sound\n\nHe ponders of these terrifying thoughts. His head is trying to make his biggest fears a reality. And he knows he cannot distract himself with the sound of his car radio. And he notices that throughout the existence of humans, we all battle fear, but many different then others. For him, the fear he is battling exists only in his head. And he then that thought makes him question why we are hear on earth, soon realizing his overthinking is scaring him, and he was wishing his car radio was on to distract him from these thoughts. \n\nThere are things we can do\nBut from the things that work there are only two\nAnd from the two that we choose to do\nPeace will win and fear will lose\nIt is faith and there's sleep\nWe need to pick one please because\nFaith is to be awake\nAnd to be awake is for us to think\nAnd for us to think is to be alive\nAnd I will try with every rhyme\nTo come across like I am dying\nTo let you know you need to try to think\n\nHe realizes there are two things he can do by himself to solve this, and it will destroy fear and peace will be on top. He can choose faith. He can rely on God for a solution, and be patient. Or he can kill himself. And he knows God, no matter what, will not be happy for you to commit suicide. He knows to have faith you need to stay alive and be patient. And he knows that the only way for you to understand this is serious is to make you feel how he feels inside. As if he is physically dying.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_53": "\nI believe that his \"car\" is a metaphor for his life and \"radio\" is a metaphor for his dreams.

He has nothing to distract him, and then he's left with his mind. When Tyler sings about peace and fear, or death and sleep, he is referencing that death is peace because you cannot think bad thoughts, while sleep is hiding from reality. Death isn't a nightmare, but when you sleep, there always a chance. When he says quiet is violent, he's talking about his dark thoughts and dark parts of his mind. Some examples would be, which I suffer from some, are: screaming, yelling, or arguing\ncrying\nhurting someone\nkilling\nhow would your death affect others\nstrange noises\ndisfigured images or scary things\nbad memories\nor just sadness\nwhen tyler sings about pulling the steering wheel, it could represent the thought of suicide because of the dark thoughts/reality.

Don't be afraid of death, or the world.  \n\nThere are things we can do\nBut from the things that work there are only two\nAnd from the two that we choose to do\nPeace will win and fear will lose\nIt is faith and there's sleep\nWe need to pick one please because\nFaith is to be awake\nAnd to be awake is for us to think\nAnd for us to think is to be alive\nAnd I will try with every rhyme\nTo come across like I am dying\nTo let you know you need to try to think\n\n>>Choosing to have faith that there will be a better tomorrow, is great.  Faith means we are alive.  We are going to surive these hard times.  We can only overcome our issues, by facing them head on, instead of trying to mask the problem.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_62": "\nI feel like this song is about a person having manic depression, and trying to cope with all emotions and thoughts coming all at once when it's silent and he's forced to deal with it.

A point in the song where Josh uses style to convey this idea is in the second verse where he writes \"I am forced to deal with what I feel , there is no distractions to mask what is real\" This completely passes over the entire meaning i described. He used style in describing distractions as masks, as if to say we hide behind distractions to cover our own feelings or thoughts from not only others but ourselves. In the fourth verse it says \"i ponder of something terrifying...\" this symbolizes the darkness that can come out when you have all distractions taken from you. Another point he uses symbolism to the thoughts and dark corners and feelings that approach when you are forced to listen only to your brain is when he writes ,\"I find over the course of human existence, one thing consists of consistence, and it's that we are all battling fear\" This also is a reference to his own personal deep in depth thoughts.

He's in the aftermath of killing his (first?) victim and he's finally thinking about it. I think this theory goes with the music video too: he's attempting to change his identity and face either to change the kind of person he is and to have a completely new start, or to change his identity so nobody finds out it was him and catches him.\nHowever, this is from more of a storytelling side and I do understand that this probably isn't the most believable theory about the song! I'm working to become an author and love to see songs from a darker and more storytelling point of view. c:\n\nHere's a complete analysis:\n\nI ponder of something great ( ::His thoughts before the murder. He's recounting on how he felt, and at the time he thought about it and thought that it was a great idea.:: )\nMy lungs will fill and then deflate\nThey fill with fire, exhale desire ( ::His anger/feelings about the person come in, and with that his desire to kill grows.:: )\nI know it's dire my time today ( ::He knows that he could get caught for this, and possibly imprisoned for a very long time making his situation dire.:: )\n\nI have these thoughts, so often I ought ( ::Now, after the murder, he's thinking about what he did very often.:: )\nTo replace that slot with what I once bought\n'Cause somebody stole my car radio\nAnd now I just sit in silence ( ::From this I guess that he doesn't have a car radio, apparently stolen, and now he sits in silence without the radio to distract him from everything.:: )\n\nSometimes quiet is violent ( ::In silence he contemplates what he did, which was an act of violence.:: )\nI find it hard to hide it ( ::Hiding that he literally committed murder is difficult for him.:: )\nMy pride is no longer inside\nIt's on my sleeve ( ::He's finding it harder to keep to himself.:: )\nMy skin will scream reminding me of\nWho I killed inside my dream ( ::In his dreams he's beginning to see who he killed, a constant reminder of what he did.:: )\nI hate this car that I'm driving\nThere's no hiding for me ( ::He can't hide anymore. I'm guessing that the police are on his trail and he's on the run.:: )\nI'm forced to deal with what I feel\nThere is no distraction to mask what is real ( ::He has nothing to distract himself with and continues to absorb himself in thoughts of what he did, and he know it was real and he can't change that.:: )\nI could pull the steering wheel ( ::He's considering killing himself to stop the thoughts, out of guilt. Or possibly in order to escape from those chasing him for what he did.:: )\n\nI ponder of something terrifying ( ::This opening line is similar to the first verse, except now he's thinking about his act and finds it terrifying. Either that or he's considering killing again, but this time does't see it as something 'great' anymore but rather horrifying to him.:: )\n'Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind ( ::Again, there's nothing he can do to distract himself and he has nothing to cloud his thoughts.:: )\nI find over the course of our human existence\nOne thing consists of consistence\nAnd it's that we're all battling fear ( ::He's afraid. For other reasons than normal people, but he realises that all people are scared of something. He's afraid of being found and of what he did.:: )\nOh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here ( ::He's beginning to sink into deep thought and can't stop.:: )\nOh my, too deep, please stop thinking\nI liked it better when my car had sound ( ::The lack of distraction is causing him to get deep into thought about everything, and it all branches from what he did.:: )\n\nThere are things we can do\nBut from the things that work there are only two\nAnd from the two that we choose to do\nPeace will win and fear will lose ( ::He concludes that if he'd been peaceful, he wouldn't be afraid like this and that people should be peaceful in order to overcome fear and avoid it, unlike him.:: )\nIt is faith and there's sleep\nWe need to pick one please because\nFaith is to be awake\nAnd to be awake is for us to think\nAnd for us to think is to be alive\nAnd I will try with every rhyme\nTo come across like I am dying\nTo let you know you need to try to think ( ::He's making a point about how he betrayed faith and didn't think about what he did, and he's saying that others should think before they commit something like murder because of the effect it has on you in the aftermath.:: )\n\nI ponder of something great ( ::He's now thinking back to what he did afterwards, recalling what he thought of it.:: )\nMy lungs will fill and then deflate\nThey fill with fire, exhale desire\nI know it's dire my time today\n\nI hope you like this interpretation of the song!
