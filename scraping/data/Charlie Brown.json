{"comment_0": "\nSince the album is a concept album this would be one of the characters talking about their failed dreams. Since 'Paradise' is about the female character's loss of innocence and disillusionment with the world I would venture a guess that the male character's feeling of failure. Its towards the beginning of the album so setting up would seem right since its a story.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nWell, since their album follows a love story, here is what I think. Hurts like Heaven was the beggining, and then it flashes back to Paradise and Charlie Brown. Paradise was about the girl leaving her home to discover herself, but all her dreams were never happening because the world is a cruel place. \n\r\nCharlie Brown is about the guy trying to make it through life before meeting her. IT starts in the beginning with him stealing a car and going downtown to do drugs with the \"lost boys\". The lights going down at the end of the scene are cop cars coming. They show up and he gets busted. It is like his \"scarecrow dreams\", bad dreams of people destroying everything he ever wanted (drugs are the scarecrows that destroyed his life). The rose part is probably either the girl encouraging him to got back up again, or some other form of moral support. Then the moral support goes on to say (no that i listen to it, it probably is the girl) to him that he should be a cartoon heart. Be like Charlie Brown, who is always getting picked on and nothing really works out for him. Always get back up again. Finally, the glow in the dark is for both of them to always be a positive light to all the boys and girls with all their problems. They went through all their troubles and they want to glow, be a light and show them how to get through it.\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite songs on their album.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nSince this is a concept album about love in a dystopia, I think (given the flow of the album), this is where the guy and girl first meet. See my full (over-)analysis of the meaning & storyline here: smrvl.com/blog/\n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nWhat an amazing riff this song has!\n\r\nI think it's a continuation of Paradise- the girl from the previous song escapes her life, \"flies away\" as she desired to, and meets up with a group of guys and hangs out with them. That's just going by the story of the album, though- taken out of context it could be about anyone who's traveling... I get the feeling it's sung from a male perspective, though I wouldn't know.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis song is amazing. Even if it's about a stolen scooter for me it's much more. It's about happiness, freedom, a good feeling... that smile that nobody can wipe away from your face; positive vibes. \"We'll be glowing in the dark\": Us being the light (good things) glowing (fighting) in the dark (bad things, evil). For me, it's the perfect song when I'm feeling down. I listen to it to forget about problems, to smile. It's one of my Coldplay's Top 5!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nWould love to know what this song means.

Think about the song title: Charlie Brown. If you've ever watched the old Charlie Brown shows then you know how Charlie Brown always had to settle for the short end of the stick, whether it was getting a rock for Halloween instead of candy or being tricked into kicking a football only to have it jerked away from him at the last second. To me this song symbolizes just those attributes. But this song is also very hopeful as Chris Martin encourages to \"Be the cartoon heart\". When I hear that line I think of the episode of Charlie Brown when all they had was a tiny Christmas tree and everyone was still happy - Cartoon heart. \"We'll be glowing in the dark\", this again provides the same message of having a hopeful heart. I love this song, when something goes wrong or I feel as though I'm on the short end of the stick in any situation, this is the perfect song. Music, lyrics, everything. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nawesome song! i love it :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\n\"stole a key took a car downtown where the lost boys meet...\"\r\nWent downtown to see a concert (\"lost boys\" could  mean Coldplay themselves because of \r\ntheir song \"Lost\")\n\r\n\"took a car downtown to see what they offered me to set me free\"\r\nthe person going to see the concert was so bummed about things and was hoping that\r\nthe  music would set him free.\n\r\n\"I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene saw the lights go down and standing in front of me\"\r\nHe had a front row seat for the concert and the musicicans were standing in front of him\n\r\n\"In my scarecrow dreams when they smashed my heart into smithereens\"\r\nhe's thinking about what bummed him out and how he had nighmares and people hurt him.\n\r\n\"Light a fire light a spark\"\r\npeople at the concert with their lighters lit\n\r\n\"we'll be glowing in the dark\"\r\n at concerts there are things fans wear that glow in the dark\n\r\n\"All the girls all the boys all the madness in the world\"\r\nall the people enjoying the concert\n\r\n\"as the room is spinning\"\r\nthe wildness of the concert the room is spinning.\n\r\n\"We'll run wild, we'll be glowing in the dark\"\r\nwell be wild at the concert and we'll all be glowing in the dark\n\n\r\n\" \n\n\n\n", "comment_9": "\nWooh, ooh ooh ooh\n\r\nStole a key\r\nTook a car downtown where the lost boys meet\r\nTook a car downtown and took what they offered me\r\nTo set me free\r\nI saw the lights go down at the end of the scene\r\nSaw the lights go down and standing in front of me\n\r\nPoh ooh ooh\n\r\nIn my scarecrow dreams\r\nWhen they smash my heart into smithereens                                              \r\nBe a bright red rose come bursting the concrete                                     \r\nBe a cartoon heart                                                                                              \r\nLight a fire a fire a spark\r\nLight a fire a flame in my heart\r\nWe'll run wild\r\nWe'll be glowing in the dark\r\nOooh ooh ooh\r\nWe'll be glowing in the dark\r\nA-woo-a-wooooo\n\r\nAll the boys, all the girls, all that matters in the world\r\nAll the boys, all the girls, all the madness that occurs\r\nAll the highs all the lows, as the room a-spinning goes\r\nWe'll run riot, we'll be glowing in the dark\n\r\nOoooh, ooooh, ooooh\r\nSo we'll soar\r\nLuminous and wired\r\nWe'll be glowing in the dark\n\r\ndirectly from coldplay.com\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nfound the link \nyoutube.com/\u2026\n\r\nat 2:50 they talk about this song. \n\r\ngetting his scooter stolen by kids was what shot off his writing of his song. haha.\n\r\nit's about venturing through the city!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nThis song is just so f***ing good.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nThe title Charlie Brown refers to the lyric 'cartoon heart'\r\nmeaning don't take your heart too serious...have a laugh..be happy\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nI interpret the end of the first verse as \"...took what they offered me: to set me free\" - they are offering freedom itself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\nIt is about Charlie Brown - winning - getting the candy instead of the rock.

Possibly not to the point of oblivion but just to feel good again, get your feet back on track. The title \"Charlie Brown\" may just relate to childhood in general.
