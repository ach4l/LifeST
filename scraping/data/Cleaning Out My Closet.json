This is a very good example. I have little doubt Mathers suffered  some kind  of abuse/neglect as a child, he is far too in touch with anger and  other emotional issues in his lyrics not to have been. There are some things you just can not fake, and thisis one. A for his mothers cd, lawsuits, etc, she should be ashamed, you know if you were a bad mother at least own up to it, instead of abuseing your child even more thru the legal system and music industry. Thats exactly what she is doing,  he has cut her out of his life, so she is using whatever she can  as a weapon. I have heard the dear marshall song (downloaded of the internet, haha), and  masicly she is  playing the concerned mother roll and  not understanding why he feels like he does, as if to convince the world her son is  the one mentally off. Mathers  appears to be, at least in my opinion, a very intellegent man, and  wounded in ways that may never heal for him.

It was about his mother trying to take some of his hard-earned money by su(e)ing(...?) him because she was a embarassed by his lyrics(government conspiracies, cuss words, etc...), or offended, or something... He made this song to counter her offense. It was all over the news, and stuff. They played a clip of the music video where he was covering a grave with dirt in the pouring rain.\n\r\nA little disturbing, but a pretty nice song. I feel a little bad about enjoying the song. This has nothing to do with my mom- I just like the beat. The end.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_225": "\nWonderful, another classic from truly the greatest rapper since Milli Vanilli. \n\r\nMarshall Mathers often \u00e2\u0080\u0098steals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 his ideas from 19th century goth poetry. Eminem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whining about his horrible, lonely, rich, lost soul is brought into even more view in this classic song from the famous goth-rapper. Roger Alan Painter, famous goth writer, wrote the poem \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cleaning out my Closet\u00e2\u0080\u0099 with verses nearly identical. When Roger Alan Painter wrote the poem, it was about the woe and depression of realising there is no god and no point in living and he is \u00e2\u0080\u0098clearing out\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the false memories in his life. Eminem reinterperated this to be thw woe and depression of realising there is no god and no point in living and also, his mother is a bit of a bitch. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mama\u00e2\u0080\u0099 being a methophor for god who created this earth. He is apologising for believing in him and asking for forgiveness about removing her from his life. It is ironic that the chours is \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry mama\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and the verses are like \u00e2\u0080\u0098And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful. But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 In the video he is both digging a grave in a cemertary and praying in a satanic church (Look at the pentagrams in the background) the two favourite hang outs for goths.\n\r\nEminem even had the gothest goth, Marilyn Manson, appear in his video \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Way I Am\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and has dressed up like him in \u00e2\u0080\u0098My Name Is\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to show the world his untimely gothness. Eminem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth studio album \u00e2\u0080\u009cDead to the World\u00e2\u0080\u009d is already in the works and two demos \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Angels love my pain\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u0098My God of Hate Fills my Black Soul with his Poison\u00e2\u0080\u0099 have already leaked onto the internet. Eminem has changed his appearance greatly, put on some mascara, paled up his face even more and is now constantly dressing up like a vampire. Many of my acquaintances foolishly believe that Eminem isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a goth and is just a rap. This is nonsense, have you heard how much Eminem whines and complains even though he is rich? He must therefore, be a goth.\n\r\nIf you like Eminem and you are interested in other forms of goth music such as Bauhaus, The Cure, Christian Death, and Hanson. If you want good music though, try Classical and appreciate the cultured side of life. Cannibal Corpse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 11th Symphony truly is the greatest musical work of all time.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_226": "\ni think this song is about being afraid to tell his mother that he is gay so he would rather kill her than to tell her..........\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_227": "\nEMINEM FUKEN SUKX I HATE THE WIGGA\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_228": "\ni like all eminems songs... they all have feeling\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_229": "\nsome people hate him and think hes a very scary violent person.. which he can be but hes taken shit all his life mostly from his mom and now hes finally standing up for himself and giving some of it back.\r\nhe has a very \"go fuck yourself\" attitude and i love it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_230": "\nIt'd be funner if eminem had a more \"I'm gonna go kill myself\" attitude though.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_231": "\nthe rhyhm to this music is great and the beat is tense just like all of the other eminem songs.

He doesn't mince his words, he just \"spits it better than 90% of rappers out there\" (to quote another Eminem song) and lays his whole life clear for everyone to see.  Now that's courage.\n\r\nIt's especially moving for me, because I feel a lot of the same feelings towards my own mother, although not quote on the same level.  She kind of destroyed my childhood.  Listening to this song makes me cry, sometimes.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_282": "\nthis is my song.....hmmm and its about eminems life\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_283": "\nThis song is wanna of my favorite by eminem....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_284": "\noh yeah. peaceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_285": "\nThis song is about Eminem's life and struggles  like how people protested his lyrics, his father's abandonment, his failed marriage with Kim, and his rocky relationship with his mother.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_286": "\nGreat song and straight from the heart, though Eminem now regrets making this record \nIn Headlights from MMLP2 the following lyrics are rapped:\n\"But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry\nrightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, 'cause\nNow I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes\nthat song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_287": "\ni feel like all true Stans should stop listening to this now tbh.

I would rather be just like I am than be Eminem, and be homophobic and commerrcialized.  You guys think he puts these lyrics together for HIMSELF or do you think he makes them so YOU guys eat it like dinner, buy his CDs, get hsi T-shirts, goto his concerts?  You guys are saying \"I like how he doesnt rap about hoes and money\" Well what the hell do he rap about? Killing people, and his mom.  GET OVER IT, alot of us have had bad childhoods, but we dont go and make millions of dollars because of it, we see therapists, maybe he should look into one, cause he seems very disturbed.  \n\n\r\nYou guys are saying when i heard \"Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess what? I am dead, dead to you as can be!\" i almost cried.  Why the hell do you like it if it makes you sad? hes probaly making it up anyways, dont see how it could make you sad unless its happened to you. \n\r\n\"Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? \r\nI have, I've been protested and demonstrated against. \r\nPicket signs for my wicked rhymes. \"\n\r\nWell, hes hated and discriminated, so why is he trying to get sympathy?  I know a guy that i go to school with that is always like \"I hate queers, queers are gonna die\"... know who we looks up to? Eminem, imagine that. \n\n\r\nIf you want music that DOESNT discriminate, but still has the same emotion as this song, and actually takes a little talent to make, go listen to some Pedro the Lion songs.  \n\r\nPost replies, only if they are gonna be intelligent, none of this \"YOUR GAY CAUSE YOU HATE EMINEM!\" or \"FUCK YOU ELECTRICPINKPANTHER\"\n\n\n", "comment_291": "\nRap sucks...thats all but Eminem can't sing and he thinks he is \"real\" music what the fuck is that...i thought it was Coming Out of My Closet....and he says Clawset..yea sucks..Rock On'\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_292": "\nThis song is about abortion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_293": "\nI'm sorry mommy, blah blah, that you are a trailer trash drug addict, so I'll write a song about it!
