{"comment_0": "\nThe song is about the Beatles feeling towards eachother. during a weak time, George brought up the Yogi and the phrase \"Come Together right now over me\" is an excerpt from the script telling them to use this song to build their bonds again and unite as one.\n\r\nEach verse is dedicated to a Beatle:\n\r\nVerse 1: \"Here come old flattop, he come grooving up slowly\r\nHe got joo-joo eyeball, he one holy roller\r\nHe got hair down to his knee\r\nGot to be a joker he just do what he please\"\n\r\nThis verse is obviously Ringo. Ringo's old school drum beats (\"Flat top\" refering to the old hair cut in the mid 1900's) were off at first with the rest of the band, but in time he got better and better (\"Groovin' up slowly\"). \"he got hair down to his knee,\" is a joke about his shaggy look when he first joined the group and since he's sitting down playing the drums his hair wouldnt quite reach his knees but you get the riff. \"Got to be a joker he just do what he please,\" Refers to him being the goof of the quad-squad.\n\r\nVerse 2: \"He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football\r\nHe got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola\r\nHe say, \"I know you, you know me\"\r\nOne thing I can tell you is you got to be free\r\nCome together right now over me\"\n\r\nDid someone say George? \"He wear no shoeshine,\" well lets face it, George wasnt fancy and liked the bare foot thing. \"He got toe-jam foot ball,\" Soccor was a sport usually practiced outside the temples where the Yogi was practiced. \"He got monkey finger,\" George was extreeeeeemly dextrous and learned many stringed instruments with ease. \"He say,' i know you, you know me'etc...\" another refrence to the Yogi.\n\r\nVerse 3: \"He bag production, he got walrus gumboot\r\nHe got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker\r\nHe got feet down below his knee\r\nHold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease\r\nCome together right now over me\"\n\r\nThis is the most obvious one... give up? really??! It's John! Duh! \"he bad production,\" refers to john constantly would stopthe recordings and piss off all the rest of the band. \"He got walrus gumboot,\" John wrote 'I am the walrus\" and kept making songs like that and refused to change his style, thus upsetting the rest of the band. \"He got Ono sideboard,\" a side board is a court term refering to pulling to the side or distracting. Yoko Ono would pull John away from the band and Is believed to be the downfall of the band. \"he one spinal cracker,\" a term related to \"braking my back,\" John would constantly argue with the band mates adn \"brake thier backs.\" \"He got feet down below his knee,\" John refused to be openminded or \"get on his knees\"  He wass stubborn and stood up, refusing to kneel to anyone.\r\n\"Hold you in his arm chair you can feel his disease,\" Anyone who really knew John, or even got close to him, you knew something was wrong physically with him, depression, anger, etc. etc..\n\r\nVerse 4:\"He roller-coaster, he got early warning\r\nHe got muddy water, he one mojo filter\r\nHe say, \"One and one and one is three\"\r\nGot to be good-looking because he's so hard to see\r\nCome together right now over me \"\n\r\nLast but not least, Paul! \"He roller-coaster,\" Paul was very emotional and would change all the time on everything whether it be a song or feelings. \"He got early warning,\" Early in, the rest of the guys knew that Paul was going to be a problem so they warned him. \"He got muddy water,\" A referance to Pauls changing facination to the band \"Muddy Waters,\" Bluesy style. \"he one mojo filter,\" Paul was very persuasive and would make the rest of the members bend to his will. \"He say 'one and on and one is three',\" Is a referance to Paul trying to constantly tell the rest of the band that even witout him, the band could survive. \"Got to be good-looking because he's so hard to see,\" Paul was the \"cute\" one of the group and was also very hard to get along with and read as aperson.\n\r\nWEllllll, thats my interpretation, i hopee it was helpful and clear things up.\r\n-elBajista\n\n\n\n\n\r\nP.S. sorry for typos, my comp is acting weird and it's hard to type :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nRemarkably for such a druggy song, there's nothing SPECIFICALLY drugs-related in the lyrics. \n\r\nIt was originally meant as a campaign song for acid-guru Dr Timothy Leary when he was going to run for US President (no kidding!), but later John re-wrote it in its present form. Alongside references to blues singer Muddy Waters and Yoko's Ono's company \"Bag Productions\" there is an inevitable Walrus. \"Spinal cracker\" reportedly refers to a form of Japanese massage involving a wife (Yoko?) walking on her husband's spine! But guess why the song got banned by the BBC...\n\r\nYes, because the State-owned broadcasting corporation deemed that the mention of Coca-Cola was advertising and therefore could not be played on the BBC! \n\r\nThe same thing happened with \"Lola\" by the Kinks, but they actually changed the lyric to the more evocative \"cherry cola\".\n\r\nSimon Beck\r\nLondon, UK\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nYou're all wrong. It's John saying that the Beatles are his band, not Paul's. Each verse is about one of the members. Ringo, first verse. George, second verse. John, third verse, kinda making fun of himself with Ono side board  and bagging production. And the last one is an attack on Paul saying one and one and one meaning John, ringo and George. And saying the only reason Paul was popular was because he was good looking and couldn't notice him any other way. John saying come together over me, not Paul. And the fact that John did all the backup vocals for this song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nLike a lot of John's lyrics (and like Dylan's), there are multiple meanings.  The two didn't have their songs wrapped neatly in a bow for the listener to easily decipher.  Both Dylan and Lennon (who were friends) realized they were truly lyrical geniuses and immensely popular.  They probably took great glee in puzzling, provoking, intriguing and teasing their listeners.  Listen to Desolation Row or Like a Rolling Stone where there are countless meanings.  Same with I want you (she's so heavy)--drugs, sex?  \n\r\nThe song is probably on one level about the four individual Beatles.  It is also about taking drugs.  It is also about sex.  In fact it is eerily similar to Happiness is a Warm Gun which also had multiple meanings---an actual pistol, sex, shooting drugs, etc. (bang bang, shoot shoot).\n\r\nThe first two verses are interesting in that they both could be about George and Ringo.  Lyrrics could be interchanged.  Flat top.  Is that an old stodgy hair style?  A guitar top?  Groovin up slowly.  Is that the groove of the song suggesting the drummer?  Or someone who was square and was slowly becoming more hip?\n\r\nShoot coca cola has a drug reference but it could be about a Coke ad Ringo was asked to be \"shot\" in. \n\r\nThe most interesting verse is the fourth which seems to be about Paul who is emotionally up and down (roller coaster), was getting guff form the other members for being too bossy (early warning), he was a buzz kill (mojo filter--filtered out other musicians creative ideas?).\n\r\nThe \"one and one an one is three\" seems to be John mocking Paul's overly simplistic song writing.  He later sang in \"How Do You Sleep,\" the only thing you did was Yesterday. \n\r\n\"Got to be good lookin'\" refers to the fact that he was the cute Beatle but the only thing he is noticed for is his looks not his intellect...(so hard to see...empty mind, or it could simply mean \"hard to read\" since he was impulsive and bossy.  It seems to be John mocking Paul's overly simplistic mind.\n\r\nThe title Come Together could be John's plea to the band members to continue making great music together and not going solo.  Or it could refer to the 1960's \"let's all get along\" ideal.  Or again it could be about sex (cum together)...it could even be about Paul's death (come together over me in my grave).\n\r\nThere are a lot of religious meanings as well from their time in India and George's stronger religious beliefs.\n\r\nI think it is by far their coolest song.  It has a Stones-like groove with dynamic drumming and and a serious danceable groove.  The song has a drug-like, happy groove with soaring lead guitar lines from George.  The \"shoot\" parts could suggest shooting up (drugs),shooting your load (sex), or even death (shoot me).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI BELIEVE THIS SONG REFERS TO THE BEATLES AS A WHOLE,THE FIRST LINE IS ABOUT RINGO,THE SECOND ABOUT GEORGE-THE MAN MIGHT I ADD,THE THIRD ABOUT JOHN AND THE FOURTH ABOUT PAUL11 AND MUST I REMIND ALL OF YOU JOHN IS NOT THE ONLY BEATLE!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nactually this song has many many drug refrences.  im not sure what joo-joo eyeballed means, but i assume its something to do with dialated pupils after using acid or smoking pot.  i know the holy roller is a refrence to rolling joints, because stores that use to sell rolling papers usually had bibles and other religous materials in them, thus producing holy roller, i even herd stories that bible pages were used to roll joints. and come on he shoot coca cola? shooting coke.  bag production, weed, baggin weed.  spinal cracker, acid hits go straight to the spin\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nanother one of the examples of john's songwriting randomness. makes you wonder what he was on back then...this is a pretty cool song though, regardless.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nby the way, has anyone seen this really cool flash cartoon/music video of Come Together on albinoblacksheep.com.

At the time this song was written, the band was facing turmoil and conflict. Come together right now over me  -- this is a plea by john to unite eihter under the dali lama or john lennon himself. \n\r\nHere come old flattop, he come grooving up slowly\r\nHe got joo-joo eyeball, he one holy roller\r\nHe got hair down to his knee\r\nGot to be a joker he just do what he please\n\r\nThis is ringo. the joker in the band, some of this refers to his blues roots, and his groove steadily improving as the band matured.\n\r\nHe wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football\r\nHe got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola\r\nHe say, \"I know you, you know me\"\r\nOne thing I can tell you is you got to be free\r\nCome together right now over me\n\r\nThis is harrison. George was the biggest follower of the hare krishna, he often went barefoot as was the practice of this religious movement. Also common for these followers, to play barefoot soccer referred to as toe-jam football. Monkey finger is a reference to his skill on the guitar. He shoots coca-cola was slang at that time for shooting up cocaine. \n\r\nHe say, \"I know you, you know me\"\r\nOne thing I can tell you is you got to be free\n\r\nthe mantra of the hare krishna.\n\n\r\nHe bag production, he got walrus gumboot\r\nHe got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker\r\nHe got feet down below his knee\r\nHold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease\r\nCome together right now over me\n\r\nthis is obviously john. bag production could either be the reference to ono's compnay, or \"bad production\", a reference to johns struggles making good music while addicted to drugs. Walrus is referenced. Ono is referenced as a sideboard, or something distracting john attention from the group. spinal cracker is probably the practice of Ono walking on his back. When john holds u close, u can feel his disease. John was self-doubting, self destructive, self-loathing at times.\n\r\nHe roller-coaster, he got early warning\r\nHe got muddy water, he one mojo filter\r\nHe say, \"One and one and one is three\"\r\nGot to be good-looking because he's so hard to see\n\r\nroller coaster. paul was up and down about keeping the group together. He got early warning from hi band mates that his superiority complex and his rding them would drive them apart. \"One and One and One is three\" This was Paul talking about the Beatles going on without him. Got to be good looking he is so hard to see. Paul was considered the good looking one. \n\r\n  ultimately, i think this song was an attempt for the beatles to come together, and be more united. this obviouisly did not succeed.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nChinup, that's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard.

Who is \"ol flattop\"? \r\nThe Republican running for governor, of course:  Ronald Reagan. \n\r\nHe had a flat-top hair style, the type that right wing conservative people had and appealed to in that era.  He was  a good looking but vapid, very right right wing movie star turned governator who severely suppressed the student movements in the California universities. \n\r\nHe say \"I know you, you know me\"\n\r\nIn other words, Ronald Reagan's campaign and appeal was based on tribal politics of white conservative fear of hippies and minorities, as well as being numbingly simplistic.\n\r\nHe say \"One and one and one is three\"\r\nGot to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see\n\r\nAgain, RR's simplistic and obviously vapid campaign slogans, relying on his charismatic good looks to hide an intellectual and moral emptiness. \n\r\n\"Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease\"  What else needs to be said?\n\r\nRemember, Beatles were indirectly political and very symbolic. \n\r\nSome of the other stuff is probably confusing mumbo jumbo (as the song was altered) or pointless, or things I don't understand yet.

I listened to the Beatles a lot as a kid, so that could just be my mind trying to make sense of it.  \n\n\r\nThis song was inspired by Timothy Leary's campaign, but Leary's arrest got in the way of that.  \r\nWhen John says \"Here come old flattop\" he's refering to Leary looking professional as a doctor and politician, but in the third line, he's basically calling Leary a hippie.  Leary did a lot of experiments and stuff with marijuana and mushrooms, he encouraged people to take acid to hallucinate.  75% of his test subjects had life changing revelations.  He encouraged people to believe in their own god. \"One thing I can tell you is you got to be free...joo-joo eyeball he one holy roller\" ...tripping and seeing God!\r\n\"Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease\" Leary was a psychologist, and the drugs or lack of drugs is the disease...with these people, I'd think that they were talking about the lack of drugs.  \n\r\nYoko Ono owned Bag Productions.  Bagism is a term which was created by John Lennon and Yoko Ono as part of their extensive peace campaign in the late 1960s. The intent of bagism was to satirize prejudice and stereotyping. Bagism literally involved wearing a bag over one's entire body. According to John and Yoko, by living in a bag, others could not judge you by the color of your skin, the length of your hair, the clothes you wore, your age, or any other such attributes. It was presented as a form of total communication. Instead of focusing on outward appearance, the listener would hear only the bagist's message.\n\r\n\"He say 'One and one and one is three'\" that line just makes me laugh.  I think of a first timer who makes all the sense in the world, but it still sounds stupid.  \n\n\n\r\nI know that it's irrelevent, but when John says \"He say 'I know you, you know me'\" I think of Bill Hicks' comedy bit about getting busted on acid.

I mean, it the drum rolling up and back down thing...it feels like a you're swinging.

It brings the drums in more and is a sly feeling transition from voice to drum. I't's almost like shh, introducing Ringo. Or like, when you start to swing (on a swing-set) you start off on the ground and swipe your feet up to go into the motion. It seems like that kind of transition to me. And as for the rest, it sounds almost like they're making fun of someone. The campaign thing makes sense, since it definately seems to refer to a drug dealer, but then the things he says to the people in his speeches (that's what I assume the \"he says\" refers to) are so simple and while it would be telling the people that he is a friend and one of them, it also makes him seem slow. \"I know you, you know me...one and one and one is three\" and the \"got to be good looking cause he's so hard to see\" could be Lennon's humor coming into the campaign. People vote based on looks, it's true, on some degree. Nixon, while turning out sorely disappointing, from the perspective of the voters in his first run for presidency, was better suited for the job than his opponent, but wasn't elected on some level because he looked unfriendly. So here, Lennon is saying that, while you can't see much of him (because of his bushy hair covering him as I'm sure would have been the case), he must just be good looking underneath it all.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_87": "\nOh, and \"One thing I can tell you is you got to be free.

Yes, the Beatles put this stuff there for a reason and that reason was to get you to listen to their lyrics in hopes that you would see their real message.  There were hidden messages in their songs and on their album covers, one of which I guess at below, but they were mostly about starting a new world of love and peace.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to get your attention by using some of the lyrics from their songs.

Come together at LA  and join us to create a new world of love and peace. \n\r\nBut, it never really happened. \n\r\nThey lament: \"they've lost themselves instead\", \"I don't know why... nobody told you how to unfold your love\", \"I don't know how... you were diverted\", \"I'm crying,....... i'm crying\". \n\r\nFast forward:\n\r\nBut that was \"soooo long ago\",... \"was it just a dream\", \"seems so real to me\". Maybe we should just \"let it be\". let's just \"Imagine\" this world of love and peace, some day \"there will be an answer \"when all the broken hearted people in the world agree\" , \"you're asking me will my love grow\" \" I don't know\", \"you stick around now it may show\". \n\r\nMy conclusion:\r\nThis may all sound farfetched but not as farfetched as believing Paul is dead.  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reason why Blue Jay Way is such a mysterious sounding song and there are many secret messages in the background( if you listen carefully with earphones). This song actually disturbs many people and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because they sense its mystical message.\n\r\nAfter forty years people still suspect that the Beatles were up to something.  I hope this post at least gets people thinking in another direction because Paul isn't dead and the Walrus stuff is meaningless. (except the \"everybody's smoking pot\" repeat at the end of the song).\r\nEven if it wasn't an actual call to come to LA certainly all their songs are about  joining them in a new world of universal human love and peace, not a Walrus, or Paul's death or John's mother or yoko Ono.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_113": "\nim convinced the 3rd stanza is about John and the 4th is about Ringo, but i cant figure out the first two.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_114": "\n\"Got to be good looking cause he's so hard to see...\"  Has got to be one of the most hilarious and clever lines written by John.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_115": "\nBeatleInsight has cool ideas...i like them a lot whether or not it's all completely true.  \n\r\nBut I am the Walrus is NOT meaningless.....actually I think it's meaning fits very well within your theory....it's about well...there are some good posts on the i am the walrus site.  the wikipedia article is also a decent place to start\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_116": "\nbut probably the best way to get what I am the walrus means is to watch bono sing it in across the universe with as clear a mind as possible....\n\r\nmaybe watching the magical mystery tour will help clear up the meaning too... the i am the walrus video is on youtube, and it makes it's meaning somewhat clear...\n\r\nbut the across the universe movie helps you understand it because it provides much of the historical context...but the meaning is still relevant today\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_117": "\nalso...i don't think it's \"everybody smoke pot\" although it could be...certainly could be a suggestion to help with the understanding. \n\r\ni think it's \"everybody haha.\"  but both actually fit with the meaning.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_118": "\nGeorge, Ringo, John, Paul.\n\r\nIn that order.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_119": "\nok why in every comment i read on a beatles song do people talk about John Lennon...there were three others..is it just that that is the only beatle people know or what...plus Paul McCartney co-wrote this song with John Lennon it wasnt just John's song\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_120": "\nI know that John wrote this but it sounds like it's about himself, in vague references...\r\nespecially bag production (he was a somewhat leader)\r\nwalrus gumboot (apparently I am the Walrus related to his life)\r\nOno sideboard (he married Yoko Ono in the year the song was released)\r\nhold you in his armchair you can feel his disease (Beatles often said that some of John's depression or anger shown outward).\n\n\n", "comment_121": "\nWhat butterfingersbeck said on 03/18/02 was accurate.

I realy don't think that The Beatles spent most of their days stuck in a drug filled haze. It is pretty hard to fully function when you are perpetually stoned. I grew up in the 60's and became a teen in the early 70's and I went throught that phaze of my own life. If you want the truth watch the movie \"Imagine\". John explained that the song was inspired by Bob Dylan who told John to write nonsence lyrics because people, like you, will almost always interperate it wrong. It was a goof. It doesn't mean anything. It is a bunch of nonsence sentences that were put together. It was meant to mess with your minds and as I can see it worked. Now here is some thing that is totaly true about this song. It was the last number one song recorded by the Beatles as a band. This is a known fact. The whole Abbey Road album was the Beatles allowing Sir George Martin to once again do his studio magic. Before that John had told Martin \"We don't want any of that studio crap any more, we want to just record it straight as we play it\". This is what was said before they did the Let It Be tapes. Martin would not produce them anymore if he couldn't work his studio magic and the band realized that they need him to do his thing. Trust me I am one of the biggest Beatle fans here. If you want drug fueled stuff check out the \"Rubber Soul\" album. They did this right after Bob Dylan turned them on to pot. This and \"Revolver\" And yes it was Dylan who smoked the first joints with them and Dylan that exposed them to weed.

The way I see it, it's kind of calling out Paul McCartney in a very discrete way for not being one of them anymore. \n\r\nThe song was written right after Timothy Leary was arrested for marijuana, and Lennon was pissed. It would be likely to assume that Paul McCartney, who didn't get try LSD until a couple years after Lennon/Harrison, was much less pissed.\n\r\nAs always discussed, each of the verses seem to be describing one person. But I think the flow of the song is much more important, as well as the contradictions between the verse about Paul McCartney and the rest of the verses. The first two verses, about Harrison and Starr respectively, come back to back with only a short guitar riff in between. There is then a short break before Lennons verse, where he notes that Yoko Ono might be drawing him away from the band (\"he got Ono sideboard,\" \"Hold you in his armchair/you can feel his disease). After this is a long guitar solo, followed by a seemingly accusatory verse about Paul McCartney. \"He Roller Coaster\" could refer to the rocky relationship between Lennon/McCartney, \"He one mojo filter\" seems to say that he takes the magic out of things, \"he say one and one and one is three\" accuses him of excluding John from recordings and leaving three Beatles, and the line \"Got to be good looking cause he's so hard to see\" indicates that McCartney was rarely around anymore, but was producing good music when he was. \n\r\nThe first three verses also have some sort of drug reference, and seem to separate McCartney as the odd man out. Harrison is \"groovin up slowly, he got joo-joo eyeballs\" which could be referring to the slow come-up on acid and the extremely dilated pupils that follow. Starr \"shoots coca-cola\" and \"one thing [he] can tell you is you got to be free.\" Lennon is a \"spinal cracker\" which may refer to the myth that LSD is permanently stored in your spine, and cracking your back may cause flashbacks. \n\r\nThe best part about The Beatles is how you can never quite tell if they were being cryptic or just producing nonsense to mess with their fans. This is one of those songs that could go either way, but I think its relation to Timothy Leary's arrest makes it too good of a political opportunity for Lennon to have passed down with a nonsensical pop-hit. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_156": "\nThe song could easily be a description of John Lennon's encounter with extraordinary Professor Timothy Leary in 1969. At that that time Leary was 49 years old, hairy from head to toe, had bulging eyes, long sideburns, was good looking, and wanted to be  his generation's guru.  At one time President Nixon called him \"the most dangerous man in America.\" I attended a lectue of his in my college days where, sitting in the lotus position, absolutely mesmerized an audience of several thousand students. He preached being free and comming together and the famous \"Turn on, tune in, drop out.\" The following weeks many of us joined in protests against the war and for civil rights.  He was quite active in the black civil rights movement and had lived in Alabama. So I'm sure he was familiar with rocknroll (roller coaster), muddy water, mojo etc.too. John started the song as a campaign song to promote Leary but may have ended up just giving his impression of the man. Peace.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_157": "\nIn the seventies the Beatles were number 1 psychedelic band all over the world. Why ? For many reasons. Their music was good and strongly inspired by Buddy Holly. They were good musicians, but not number 1. Their lyrics were truly original and incredible. They could say terrible things, but had the ability to not create any alarm or scandal. Every song by the Beatles can apparently have many meanings. However no metal band is as hard and explicit as they were. They possessed great abilities. Or were they possessed ?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_158": "\nIt's nice to know that I'm not the only one who thought it was originally at the four members of the Beatles - four verses each describing a person and it is obvious that the guy in the last verse isn't the same as the ones described in the previous verses - it seems to point to four different people - I've often thought it but it was po pooed but people. My brother pointed to the Q analysis which thought that the lines \"got to be a joker, he just do what he please\" where about the Marharshi and Lennon's disillusion with him. \r\nThe first verse fits with the Marharshi and possibly even the second but the second two certainly don't - thinking about it I think it's a song about the people Lennon was trying to disassociate from - the first verse is the Marharshi and then come the verses about George, himself and Paul - the roller-coasting could be a variant of railroading - and one and one and one is three and got to be good looking are John saying Paul is overly logical and boring - only interesting to anyone who fancies him. \n\r\nThe only thing that jars with this is the negative picture John paints of himself - he doesn't come across as a self-efacing guy in any of the accounts of him I've read.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_159": "\nThis song is about a guy who starts really straight, not orientation but 'so square he has corners' kind of thing.

What with being the adult child of an alcoholic father, I have come to see that this songs lyrics may well be the description of the manifestation of either direct or indirect sustance abuse on each of the members of the beatles. The last 3 line of each verse describe a way of being which could be a result of substance abuse.\r\nIt is a warning to me of the pervasiveness of substance abuse and how it transcends people families and generations. We all want to be happy but substance is not the way to achieve ones greatness. Awareness is the way. The Maharishi was instrumental in showing them the way out through transcendental meditation.\r\nTranscendental Meditation and substance abuse are not compatible.\r\nSubstance abuse leads to an all about me structure in the mind.\r\nIrresponsibility prevails.

And, because \"cuming together\" is all about love, it could be John's feeling that the Beatles should just have group sex to resolve their differences, especially when it comes to the evil Yoko.  And that's not even mentioning the obvious sex/drug double meaning of \"Happiness is a Warm Gun.\"  Aside from this, many people appear to believe each stanza alludes to each Beatle (the insect, the car, or referencing drum beats?), and there is more than enough evidence to see that this is one layer of the song.  I always related to the line \"Got to be good looking cause he's so hard to see,\" as I am shy, withdrawn, uncomfortable with emotions, introverted and in my younger years got much needed attention due to my looks.  Funny how your mood and your person history intersect with the though-stream of the artist in unique and powerful ways.

The first verse is about Ringo star the drummer of the band. They describe him as \u00e2\u0080\u009cGroovin' up slowly\u00e2\u0080\u009d referring to his inability to play the drums up to par as the Beatles when he joined the group. Also they say \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe got to be a joker he just do what he please\u00e2\u0080\u009d which refers to him being the group clown and tension releaser of the Band. The second verse is about George Harrison the main guitarist of the group. They described him as \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonkeyed fingered\u00e2\u0080\u009d which means he was very good with all musical instruments including the unknown sitar which he mastered and used in many Beatles songs. Another thing they said about him was \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe shoot coca-cola\u00e2\u0080\u009d which means he shoot up into his blood stream cocaine, all the Beatles did use this drug, but this was George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite. The Third voice is about John Lennon  who was one of the leading singers in the band. They described him as \u00e2\u0080\u009cBad production\u00e2\u0080\u009d because he had been doing so many drugs it was effecting his ability to make amazing music like I am the walrus and how odd the song script was. Also they said \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe got feet down below his knees\u00e2\u0080\u009d Meant he would never yield to authority because he was to stubborned and arrogant about his ideas and views. The fourth and final verse in this song is about Paul McCartney One of the main guitarist and singers of the group. They said he said this to them \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne and One and One is three\u00e2\u0080\u009d which means he wanted to leave the group, but they could still be the Beatles without him. Another thing they described hims was \u00e2\u0080\u009cGot to be good looking because he is so hard to see\u00e2\u0080\u009d Which was referring to how good looking Paul was, but that he was rude selfish person deep inside.  \n\nIn the end you cant help but see the irony in this song. The song title is \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome together\u00e2\u0080\u009d yet each of them gets ridiculed by the others in there personal verse showing how torn apart the group was and why this was the last album the band every made together. They let drugs and selfishness tear apart arguably the greatest band of all time.

It centers on one participant of this threesome, another male. The Beatle, who is at this moment in time essentially a spectator, observes the actions and physical attributes of this male and watches in fascination as him and the other participant come together right over him - this could mean that the two physically came together in the act of sex, or that their orgasms occurred at precisely the same time, right over him.\n\r\nHere come old flattop, he come grooving up slowly\r\nHe got joo-joo eyeball, he one holy roller\r\nHe got hair down to his knee\r\nGot to be a joker he just do what he please\n\r\nThe song begins, like much of the rest of the song, describing attributes of the male the song is centered on. He is described as grooving up slowly, with red eyes from excessive drug use (which is, no doubt, the only reason this threesome happened in the first place). He has long hair, as was characteristic of many hippies in that era, and was quite a joker in the sex scene, doing whatever he pleased without fear of repercussion. This could imply some kinky habits in his sex life.\n\r\nHe wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football\r\nHe got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola\r\nHe say, \"I know you, you know me\"\r\nOne thing I can tell you is you got to be free\n\r\nThe man, now characterized as a hippie, is further personified to this point: he wears no shoes, shoots coke and believes in the ideals of free love. He is someone the Beatle knows, reminding him that they know each other and that therefore whatever happens in that room is all right. His monkey fingers prove him to be adept in the act of manual sex, also.\n\r\nCome together right now over me\n\r\nAt this point in the song, the two being watched come together (for the first time?) over the Beatle, who continues to watch in fascination.\n\r\nHe bag production, he got walrus gumboot\r\nHe got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker\r\nHe got feet down below his knee\r\nHold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease\r\nCome together right now over me\n\r\nThe man is suggested to be a drug dealer. 'Walrus gumboot' implies that he can afford to buy expensive things but chooses not to for the sake of keeping up his hippie repertoire; the boots could also involve his love of kinkiness. He has sideburns and practices rough sex, enough to crack the spine of his partner. The man, who is promiscuous, undoubtedly has numerous STD's. \n\r\nHe roller-coaster, he got early warning\r\nHe got muddy water, he one mojo filter\r\nHe say, \"One and one and one is three\"\r\nGot to be good-looking because he's so hard to see\r\nCome together right now over me.\n\r\nThe rough sex continues; it is suggested that the man gives early warning to when he is going to climax. His sweat mixed with his hippie filth produces a sort of muddy water effect, glistening all over his skin. His mojo, or magic spell, illustrates his unbeatable power in sex and seduction. \r\nThe man then points out that there are three participants, though only two have been partaking in most of the action up to this point, and that the Beatle needs to take part in the sex. What happens next is unclear, though some sort of sexual act occurs involving the Beatle in which the Beatle can no longer view the man directly - I won't illustrate this scene; you can imagine it yourself. The participants of the threesome come together, both in the physical and climactic sense. It truly is a poetic scene.\n\r\nSex can be a truly poetic experience; I love how different and laid back its portrayal in this song is. It's one of my personal favorites.\n\r\nDude McGuire\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_215": "\nAll you cleaver might be right, but I present you a different and couragous meaning:\n\r\nIt's about a frusturated porn actress.

Paul is the tallest member of the band ,maybe John is saying he had to be good looking because he's so hard to see because he would of been nearer the back at school making him harder to see. on the other hand it could be out of bitterness. despite being the tallest member of the band paul isn't actually that tall , he's average height in the UK, meaning all the other band members were under average height including John . in this context it could mean that he's got to be good looking because he's average height and amount tall men would be hard to see, however I personally think it likely references him being at the back of a school photo. in all honestly I alway felt this line was about George because George was the quiet one but many people were into the fact that he was quiet ,teenage girls at the time, however none of the other lines in the verse really match up with it being him and the second line seems to fit much better and Paul fits better to this line.  hope you enjoyed .\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_219": "\nthere is no meaning to this song...but it is by far the beatles best song\n\n\n", "comment_220": "\nThis is an easy one to understand.\r\nThe lines ''Come together, Right now, Over me'' speaks for it self.\r\nCome''Cum'' you know...he was gay or something. maaan. i am so deep.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_221": "\nOkay first things first, hve you guys realized that theres no proof that paul is daed so stfu, second John is singing the song so it makes no sence if he says come together over me means come together over paul...and they tried keeping it a secret by supposedly having a \"new paul\" for a reason...they wouldnt make it that obvious...think ppl\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
