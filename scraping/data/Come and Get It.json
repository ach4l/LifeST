This is about being there all the time waiting for him and all he needs to do is go to her for her affection.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nIt means that she'll always be there for him. I'm betting he(whoever \"he\" is) and her(Selena) don't date anymore, and she'll be there whenever he wants to date with her again, if he does! I LOVEE THIS SONG!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nInteresting lyrics.\n\nNotice the use of the reference to the childhood game of Tag, \"No takebacks\", With this in mind the Come & Get It chorus of 'Na Na Na Na' could be interpreted as the childish taunt of 'Na Na Na Na'. Which puts the whole song in a different light and makes the elemental aspects of the music video make more sense.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\numm I think this song is pretty self explanatory, my guess is since her and justin parted on good terms since he was going on tour and she was busy with wizards and everything. but she's just saying hey when your ready i'll still be here because i love you.... im not much of a bieber fan but i do like him and selena together so hoping \"Jelena\" gets back together sometime in the near future\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
