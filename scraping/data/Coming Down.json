{"comment_0": "\nTo me its talking about an unhealthy relationship. This love or relationship is compared to religion and the act of sex or giving one's body to someone is the sacrifice the guy/religion requires. It seems that the relationship is very one sided. Its like she wants to please this person but after the act she feels empty and gets nothing from it while the guy gets what he wanted, but she acknowledges her mistake for doing it despite knowing better.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nOkay but tell me this DOESN'T remind you of James Cook from Skins UK?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
