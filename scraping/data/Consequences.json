{"comment_0": "\nWhile we're used to having sensual, sexy songs from Camila, this time, she's delivering a soulful and deep hit about a failed relationship. At the beginning of the song, she starts out with all of the consequences of her breakup, all of the pain that she's living through and how the relationship made her feel so good. You're listening and thinking that she definitely needs to get back together with this person, right? As soon as you're sure that they were meant to be, Camila dives into all of the negative consequences that the relationship had on her. She repeats all of the good things about the relationship, but continues to list her negative feelings about it, too. In this beautiful ballad, we are not only reminded that Camila Cabello has some major pipes, but also that most things in life are not all good or all bad, and it is up to us to decide if the good outweighs the bad.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
