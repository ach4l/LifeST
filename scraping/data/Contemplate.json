{"comment_0": "\nObviously this song is about Wale questioning himself in a relationship going in the wrong direction, but these lyrics really made me think there's something even deeper to it;\n\nIn the viper room with just me and river phoenix \nWith Courtney love and late Washington \nWith a note there and I'm thinking of reading \nThis ain't her, Chris Benoit \n\nRiver Pheonix overdosed on Heroin in 93' in the Viper Room (in LA) and in the same year Kurt Cobain (Courtney Loves husband of course) apparentley \"committed suicide\" (I believe he was murdered though) the next year in 1994. And the note he refers to is obviously the \"suicide note\" Kurt left in the greenhouse. Then you have Chris Benoit, who murdered his family then killed himself (a fishy enough story behind all of that). Wale is known to have ties in the Illuminati (he raps about it himself) and all the people just mentioned have/had ties to the Illuminati as well. All suspicious and dramatic/tragic deaths.  I would love to know exactly what Wale is saying there exactly, but it's an interesting few lines he threw in there to say the least. I hope to meet him one day and ask him myself. I live near DC and that's where he reps, so who knows!? If I do I will report what he said here first!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
