I like this song most because she doesn't paint herself as the pure victim - it's kind of an empowering song, about not being ashamed of it and about not being defined by it. For me, anyway.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis reminds me of The Yellow Wallpaper.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI feel some serious Jessica Jones vibes, especially with the line \"Who is in control?\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI, personally, believe this song is about a person with multiple personality disorder. \n\r\nIn the lines \"I can't help this awful energy\" and \"God damn right, you should be scared of me\" it seems as if there are multiple 'people' speaking, with one being meaner, and the other try in counteract the more negative voice. \n\r\nFor the line,\"Who is in control?\" The person singing is questioning which 'person' is actually controlling themself. \n\r\nLastly, in these four lines, \"I'm well acquainted with villains that live in my head, they beg me to write them so they'll never die when I'm dead. And I've grown familiar with villains that live in my head, they beg me to write them so I'll never die when I'm dead.\" The person is (possibly) keeping a sort of journal, or diary, that they write about this other personality. It may be that they are 'Immortalized' by being written down, and telling others about the 'Demons'. This especially rings with the \"So I'll never die when I'm dead\" as the person is talking about themself. \n\r\nWell, that's just a theory. A song theory! \r\n(Game theory reference aside, don't take this as the 'real' interpretation of the song, I'm merely a bored 12 year old, interpreting a song I like.)\n\r\n:)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI think sending her away to find riches means 'they' see her as a larborer \r\nMore than just the house is alive, shes trapped in the house with her own monsters\r\nShes alone with her thoughts and her mind is driving her crazy, she cant control it.\r\nShe cant control herself and at the same time she can, its incredibly confusing to describe, but if youre experienced it, it makes perfect sense\n\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI think this song is about an eating disorder. \r\nThe first verse is describing how someone gets hooked with an ED. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey send me away to find them a fortune\u00e2\u0080\u009d reminds me of the promise from Ana (in my case) that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be happy once I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thin, all my problems will disappear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe house was awake, the shadows and monsters, the hallways, they echoed and groaned\u00e2\u0080\u009d makes me think of the various triggers around my house that remind me of how \u00e2\u0080\u009cimperfect\u00e2\u0080\u009d I am. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI sat alone, in bed till the morning.
