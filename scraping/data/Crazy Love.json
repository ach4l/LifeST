I love it so much.\n\n\n", "comment_1": "\nSuch a great song\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nWhen I listen to this song it gives me that same relaxing feeling that I get with Sitting on the Dock of the Bay by Otis Redding.  Very few songs can give me that wonderful feeling.  Where it brings in calm feelings and that everything is going to be okay.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
