{"comment_0": "\n\"No need to fix what God put a paint brush on\"\nThis song, and all his lyrics, are just so awesome! Instead of using his rap skills to talk about drugs, and sluts and all the other crap, he uses it to talk about how beautiful you are and not to care about what other people are saying about you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\n\"Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see\nThat the hands can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t touch\nThat them broads can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you\"\n\n\nReminds me what i told this girl.. She didn't need any make up or anything with her outward appearance.  She was beautiful but she couldn't see it.. And that's you\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI love this song it rocks it is the best ever\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\ni love this song it rocks wow i never get enough of that song i love it song much i play it over and over again i wish i could meet j.cole\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI think this is a beautiful song about appreciating who you are! I love how J.Cole expresses his own thoughts on his appearance/smile, etc.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nIn this song J. Cole is trying to teach his female friend how to love herself. He explains how she has a boyfriend that just brings her down even more by showing her what she's missing instead of what she has (\"So all you see is what you lacking not what you're packing\").He also talks about coming to love himself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
