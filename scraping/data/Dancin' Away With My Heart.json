{"comment_0": "\nSuch a good song. To me, the band is singing about that bittersweet feeling when you look back on times when you were younger and in love for the first time. You never forget your first love; they're always a part of you. My first love and I were together for six years. Broke up last October. I'll never forget him. The lyrics in this song are spot on. The first person who stole your heart will always be with you. And even when you move on or find someone new, you will still find yourself wondering whatever happened to them or if they still occasionlly think of you, too.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nlove this song. just brings you back to those times when you were younger.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI love this song soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
