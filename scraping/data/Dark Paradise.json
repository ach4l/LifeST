She was devastated, and it may have been months or even years since his passing and she hasnt moved on, when her friends keep pushing her to do so.\n\nSometimes she has the feeling that when she does leave earth to heaven that he wont be waiting on her. Every night she dreams of him and its a dark paradise because even though she loves him so much she knows it just a dream, and when she wakes up, she knows he wont be there.\n\n\"There's no remedy for memories\"  Theres not a cure for remembering something there's no way to get him out of her head, and she doesnt want him out. She can feel him touching her in her dreams, she wants to be with him so much she doesnt want to wake up.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nA song with the not uncommon topic of mourning a lost love, but damn if it isn't beautiful.

I suffer from paranoia and mental disorders. Often times I feel like my sanity is not there anymore. I feel lost and in a different world altogether. This song describes exactly what I feel.\nWhen it says \"there is no remedy for melody for remedy your face is like a melody it won't leave my head.\" I feel that in moments of panic and fear all I can think about is how I miss being calm and at rest. When it says \"your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine. But I wish I was dead,\" it's like my mind telling me that everything is fine, but the only way I'll feel fine is if I am dead. \"Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise, no one compares to you, I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side.\" I feel like when I close my eyes, I can block out the world, it's dark, and temporarily calming.

He commited suicide and now she realizes that she will never be able to forget about him.\n\r\n\"No one compares to you. I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side.\" ----- This line is saying that she loved him but is afraid that, since he took his life, that he may have not made it into the gates of heaven. Many people are unsure of whether those who kill themselves will still inherit the Kingdom of God.\n\r\n\"But I wish I was dead.

Clearly, he is dead and wherever he is, she just wants to be with him.\n\r\n\"And there's no remedy for memory. Your face is like a melody.\" ------This lines are amazing. She's saying that there is no cure for memories. If you hold a memory of a loved one, nothing can make that memory disappear and you will, whether you'd like to or not, will always remember the one you first loved.\n\r\nThe song is, over-all, about not being able to live without a loved-one and accepting the fact that he/ she is gone and not being afraid to still think back to the good times with that person and welcome in memories of the past, even if they are dark...\n\n\n\n\n\r\nHer memories are clearly bitter sweet.

She went to a special school that helped kids with substance abuse problems from the age of 14-18.  If you listen carefully, you might see this is her letting go of her addiction.
