Darkness and evil envelops everything else - the only saints are manmade statues, people are \"made of greed,\" etc. Worst of all, there are demons inside him. He's conflicted; he's pleading to her to save him while acknowledging it's better to push her away for her own good (\"It's woven in my soul / I need to let you go\").\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nIt's saying that we as humans tend to set expectations to high for ourselves. We all have \"demons inside\". We all have troubles. We all battle ourselves sometimes. We are all imperfect. We are all human, and that is enough. :) The song sounds sad, but the message is somewhat positive: embrace your qualities and imperfections, because it makes us who we are. We try to shield others from our dark side, which is fine, but we just need to know that we DO have a darker side. It's woven in our soul, because we are imperfect humans.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI have interpreted that the song reveals a true key to living a happy life: everyone has flaws and we have to accept it. \n\r\nIn the beginning, it mentions that \"the saints we see are all made of gold.\" To me, this says that people who we think are perfect (or close to perfect) have a greedy side too (because they are metaphorically made of gold). It is also possible that the song may mean that something is causing the person to be nice that most people may be disappointed in. For example, if a teenager's parents pay them to be nice, are they really nice?\n\r\nLater, it states that our role models are the worst ones to follow: \"When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail are the worst of all.\" This line simply says that idols are dangerous. If you really look up to someone who has flaws (because everyone has flaws), you will eventually, whether you know it or not, take on those flaws in an effort to be like that person. It's sad but true. It has also given me second thoughts about role models.\n\r\nLater on, it says, \"I wanna hide the truth/I wanna shelter you/But with the beast inside/There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nowhere we can hide.\" Basically, the person singing the song wants to help the one they love, but end up confessing that there's nothing they can do to shelter them from the cruel and unforgiving world. The singer knows that, although they try to be as good of a human as they can, there is no way to stop the sin that is waiting to emerge from inside. The singer could try to protect them from the world, but it would be pointless because the flaws would emerge on the person they were trying to protect. This is also sad but true, but reenforces the idea of the song interpreting that no one is perfect. \n\r\nThus, the chorus to the song: \r\n\"When you feel my heat \r\nLook into my eyes\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide \r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\r\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get too close\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark inside\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\"\n\r\nOf course, the author does not actually mean that they have physical demons inside of them, but demons are a reference to the sin and flaws that rest within. The rest is pretty much self explanatory:)\n\r\nThe rest of the song goes on to support the \"thesis\" more if you take the time to read into it.\n\r\nOverall, the singer loves the person they are singing to, the intended audience. He wants to protect the intended audience from the darkness of the world, but it comes out as warning of the lingering dangers because he can not do anything to prevent his inner \"demons\" from hurting them. \n\r\nIf you ask me, this is a pretty depressing song. It is also and eye opener to see that other people actually notice that this world has become crueler over the years. \n\r\nIf you were to take away one thing from reading this (if you actually did read this!), then I would like you to know this: Nobody's Perfect. But, more importantly, the reason Imagine Dragons even decided to write this song in the first place is because Hannah Montana failed to get that point across while people actually liked her. Just kidding! Kind of...\n\r\nWell, anyway, thanks for reading!\n\r\n~Carly\n\r\nPS-This is my first review, so I would really appreciate any feedback given.

It can be our deepest, darkest, desires. Essentially, our \"demons\". The song, Demons, has a line that evokes something that we all share in common in terms of our personal shadow:\r\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get too close\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark inside\"\r\nAnother key element to the shadow is that all psychologically healthy humans want their shadow to be hidden. We all experience the blossoming of a new friendship and how we want to forever preserve a certain image towards that person of ourselves. We do not want to taint it, so, we don't want that person \"to get too close\" because we think that \"it's dark inside\".\r\nSuch a powerful song with a catchy beat.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nThis song is about protecting the ones we love from the demons that surround us. \n\r\nIt's about those of us who try to hide the harsh reality of the world (when our dreams all fail) and our own internal struggles/demons (the ones we hail are the worst of all) from our loved ones thinking we're protecting them or sheltering them from the hurt and pain.\n\r\nThe author then talks about how futile it is to do this because the demons will still be there even if you hide them (But with the beast inside, There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nowhere we can hide) and the only way to truly vanquish them is to let the ones we love in to help us fight them (I can't escape this now, Unless you show me how).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nThis song makes me think that person A is in love with person B, but person a thinks themself too lowly of person B.

When you're feeling down and out of luck, when the world seems to be an unfair place to live.\n\r\n\".. and the saints we see are all made of gold ..\" more setting, but allusion to the fact that the although it APPEARS as though the good people in this world are part of a life that's unattainable, the author also suggests that the \"saints\" we don't see are very real, very human, and don't call attention to themselves like those made of \"gold\".\n\r\n\"When your dreams all fail ..\" more setting, speaking of the betrayal of innocence by the harsh realities of life.\n\r\n\".. and the one's we hail are the worst of all ..\" direct statement against the people who we place in control of our lives, like parents, politicians, doctors, generals, managers, teachers.  Again, the use of the word \"worst\" implies that there has been a breach of trust recently, of abandonment, of not really having all the answers they claimed to have during the listener's former period of innocence.\n\r\n\".. and the blood's run stale.\"  This is an interesting, ambiguous line that I think implies that at one point, there was a willingness to fight against this reality that has now faded into submission.  The time of fighting has since passed, to be replaced by the above setting of betrayal, loss of trust and defeat.\n\r\n\"I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you ..\" is the emotion of the song, in response to the setting.  The singer references himself, appealing to his listeners that if he could NOT share this truth with them, then he would, feeling that it might offer them some sort of protection.  However ..\n\r\n\".. but with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide ..\" is the truth, plain and simple.  There's no way to keep the truth from someone if they want to find it, and by lumping himself in with the word \"we\" he alludes to the fact that he feels this beast (ie demon) is something that everyone who's lost their innocence possesses, and the truth being sought by the listener is going to bring them face to face with their own beast, eventually, so there's really no point in hiding from it.\n\r\n\"No matter what we breed, we are still made of greed ..\" this begins the explanation as to why the world is this way.  Essentially, what the singer is saying that it doesn't matter what our best intentions are, greed still governs our intentions.  He believes that all people are creatures of want, inherently selfish, and no matter how hard we try to overcome this \"me-centric\" reality, greed is the foundation upon which we were all raised, and that's the demon we need to confront.\n\r\n\"This is my kingdom come ..\" this is his message to his listeners.  It's only his, and others might have a different outlook, but if someone's asking for answers and they come to him, this is the world the singer feels he lives in, and this is why he feels their innocence was taken from them.\n\r\n\"When you feel my heat, look into my eyes ..\" this is the singer's justification for the way he feels.  Heat is in reference to the demon inside him, but it's also in reference to the aforementioned blood he held within him, his passion, the point upon which his own innocence was taken from him that he still hasn't overcome.  When that personal heat comes to the fore, and that guard goes down, he encourages the listener to look into his eyes, because ..\n\r\n\".. it's where my demons hide ..\" implying that there's something he wants to let out, and he comes close, but those personal truths remain inside of him, visible only through his eyes when he lets his guard down.\n\r\n\"Don't get too close, it's dark inside ..\" is a warning, but it's more for self preservation than anything else.  He doesn't want the listener to ask the questions he himself doesn't want to answer, but at the same time, he wants SOMEONE to help him, but he can't bear the idea of destroying that person's own innocence in order to do so.  He doesn't want them to experience his \"darkness\".\n\r\n\"Curtains call is the last of all ..\" this line sets the stage (pardon the pun) for the identity of the world the listener now might accept is made up of bitter secrets kept from them.  The singer suggests that the play is now over, the fantasy, the Act, and now the reality sets in to fill the void.\n\r\n\".. when the lights fade out all the sinners crawl ..\" likening the people of the world to insects and vermin, who when the spotlights are off them go about their day to day business acting in their own self-interest.\n\r\n\"So they dug your grave ..\" \"they\" being the sinners mentioned in the previous verse, and the grave in reference to the listener's own fall from innocence, the tarnishing of the soul, the descent into darkness each of them is a part of.\n\r\n\"And the masquerade ..\" nice line.  The \"masquerade\" is comprised of the same \"sinners\" from above, only this time, the delusion once held by the listener as to all these people being themselves people worthy of respect and admiration is now understood to be a facade.  Thus, now that the truth is out, sinners are seen as they really are.\n\r\n\".. will come calling out at the mess you've made ..\" awesome line!  The singer doesn't just suggest that this will happen ... he confirms it.  That collective group of phonies WILL pounce on the listener's loss of innocence, calling (note the similarity to \"crawling\" mentioned above) out at the way life actually is, as if it's the listener's own fault for losing their own innocence.  The work of having \"dug a grave\" in the expectation that it will be filled by the listener's loss of innocence speaks to the singer's bleak opinion of the rest of the world.  However ..\n\r\n\"Don't want to let you down but I am hell bound ..\" tells the listener that even though he's trying in his own way to \"breed\" something good from all this, he's casting his own lot with those of the other sinners, and doesn't have much hope.\n\r\n\".. though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth ..\" regardless of where he's headed, he's giving all of this advice and opinion to the listener, without using a mask like others might.\n\r\n\"They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate ..\" an interesting line.  \"They\" in this is back to the sinners mentioned before, and he's trying to distinguish himself from the others by removing what he \"makes\" from the equation, believing that whatever the outcome of this song, it'll be up to the listener to take from it, and not be \"made\" to do against their will.  The \"what\" the listener makes is in relation to the \"breeding\" mentioned before.  In essence, he's telling the listener not to follow the same path as everyone else, and confront that demon without trying to hide it inside.\n\r\n\"It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go ..\" double-meaning?  Is the earlier truth of the singer's revelation what's woven in his soul, or the fact that he needs to let the listener make their own choice on what path to follow?  Perhaps \"it's\" both.\n\r\n\"Your eyes they shine so bright, I want to save that light ..\" from the darkness inside him, seeing such pure innocence is a bright light, and he wants to keep it around him for as long as he can without extinguishing it.  This is a paradox, considering he feels that the listener will eventually come to face their own truth at some point, based on the \"made of greed\" logic from earlier.  However, in his last line, he turns that paradox on it's ear.\n\r\n\"I can't escape this now, unless you show me how!\" He feels that he's trapped in this reality, and now that he's confronted his own demons through the course of the song, he understands that he needs to place his faith back in someone else again, to shed that selfishness and greed he feels is the problem, and trust in the purity and innocence of the listener to help him escape his own path to hell.\n\r\nI've listened to a lot of music over the years, and yes, I've loved listening to Imagine Dragons these past couple months.  But when this song came on the radio, I was blown away.  I listened, and thought to myself \"this guy knows exactly what he's trying to say in this song, and he's trying to say to everyone\".  There's not many songs like that anymore.  It was enough to compel me to sign up on this forum and add my own interpretation.

It is why people with depression often don't tell anyone about what they are feeling and may push away friends and family. You need to understand in clinical depression major components are a sense of utter hopelessness as well as feelings of guilt and shame. There is a desire not to \"burden\" others with your problems, and why bother when nothing will help anyway? \nThis song is about such an individual who is struggling with these feelings. They won't talk about their feelings because they don't want to burden others, yet secretly hope someone else will recognize their pain.

The demons refer to the things from said past that trouble and effect that persons daily life and interactions.

He knows it effects him and how he sees the world, behaves, etc perhaps he becomes depressed or angry. He wants to protect the person he cares about, he doesn't want him/her to know what happens to him when these demons surface. However, he knows that he can't hide it from the person he cares about. He knows he cannot control it.\n\r\n\"When you feel my heat\r\nLook into my eyes\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\r\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get too close\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark inside\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\"\r\n--- He is asking the person he cares about to try and understand him when his demons surface. He wants them to look into his eyes and see he has changed, and to know the demons dwell just under the surface, so close it can be seen in his eyes. He is warning the person to stay away and not get close to him. He is telling said person that its dark inside, what he feels is dark.\n\r\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to let you down\r\nBut I am hell bound\"\r\n--- He doesn't want to disappoint the person he cares about b/c of his demons, but the things he has done are something he deems so terrible that he would be sent to hell (either literally if he is religious, metaphorically if his life is hell, etc). \n\r\n\"Though this is all for you\r\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hide the truth\"\r\n--- He doesn't want to hide the truth from the person he cares about, but he will still put up a facade. He is letting that person know that the facade of nothing being wrong is all for the sake of the person he cares about.\n\r\n\"They say it's what you make\r\nI say it's up to fate\r\nIt's woven in my soul\r\nI need to let you go\"\r\n--- He is absolving himself of any blame in the situation. How he acts is in him, and he cannot change it. Its all destiny/fate, not his doing or choosing. Because of that he needs to let the person he cares about go.\n\r\n\"Your eyes, they shine so bright\r\nI want to save their light\r\nI can't escape this now\r\nUnless you show me how\"\r\n--- I think this can be interpreted two ways. Unlike him there are not demons in the other persons eyes. The other person is his exact opposite.(1) He does not want to influence the person he cares about and take the light out of their eyes b/c of how he acts or feels. OR (2) He wants to save the light in the other persons eyes for him. He wants to know how that person obtains in and keeps it. Either way he knows that there is no way to escape his demons without that persons help.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_29": "\nI believe that this song is about how some people are depressed.

And I'll preface this by saying that the song is perhaps one of the best I've heard in the modern era.\n\nI agree with a lot of sentiments here and my thoughts are quite closely aligned to them.\n\nThe song suggests that we as individuals all have some sort of internal demon that we're forced to deal with at some point - whatever that might be - and that although at some point it might appear that we have overcome it, the demon is hiding in there for good, somewhere deep inside. \n\nThat the demon inside of us can be one that individuals hide on purpose and choose not to tell anyone. Only when they seek help or guidance and let others in, do others then understand what they're going through and how they feel. \n\nUltimately, the song is about trying to hide something deep down and not tell anyone - the demon - but knowing that eventually, you will have to do so. \n\nAll in all, a great song and some great views on what it means to different individuals.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_36": "\nThis song is (IMHO) about the ennui and meaningless that come from a lack of challenge or conflict in life, which leads the narrator to become (potentially) dangerous to those s/he loves, as s/he has no outlet for her destructive energy.\n\r\n\"When the saints we see are all made of gold\" refers to having no role models to guide one's moral actions (further explored with \"the ones we hail are the worst of all\". Because the narrator has no guiding light, they are open to potentially satisfying their desire for adventure by harming those close to them instead of fighting their enemies. This is represented by the \"demons\" who will attack if the person's lover gets too close and therefore presents an easy target. The common use of \"demons\" in everyday language to refer to past traumas might mean that past experiences of conflict, combat or abuse have acclimatised the narrator to violence (whether physical or not) and she now has a need for it.\n\r\n\"When the blood's gone stale\" refers to the pursuit of a fleeing, wounded enemy; the pursuit could be through investigation, litigation, activism, whatever; maybe there's no meaning. But now it has gone stale and the person is bored. He feels he is no longer alive because there's no buzz- hence the reference to a grave and feeling that people will say he has failed. There are references to others being fakes- \"masquerade\", \"greed\", etc. \"Curtain call\" refers to the end of the pursuit and it could even mean that the narrator has won their case or campaign (\"the cards all fold) but now there are no more thrills.\n\r\n\"It's woven in your soul\", \"I can't escape this\" further emphasise that the beast or demon is part of who he is- unless his/her lover can change this.\n\r\n\"Heat\" seems to mean the fire s/he feels while fighting/pursuing her enemy, contrasted with days being \"cold\" when the joy of the chase ends. He is hell-bound because though he fights for his lover or others (\"this is all for you\") he enjoys the conflict too much and is just using good motives as an excuse to indulge his passion for excitement (\"don't wanna hide the truth\"). He wants to shelter his lover from the ennui of having no thrills and from his own demons.\n\r\nI personally feel that \"This is my kingdom come\" is kind of sinister. It implies things will be this way for the foreseeable future and there is no way either to find a new challenge, re-start the old one or change and become okay with having no conflict. The line about \"no matter what we breed/we are made of greed\" implies that the lover shares at least some of the narrator's need for conflict and tactics of using \"cover\" to satisfy this need; however now that their fight is at an end, the stronger or more sinister appetite of the narrator is a threat to the lover and to protect him or her the narrator must send them away.\n\r\nI've struggled with some of these issues myself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_37": "\nAs  i am suffering from great vision impairment ,this one aptly suits me.\nLooks like every line seems to be written only for me.

The beginning of the song is referencing the ideas of being cold, down on your luck and that \"saints\" are made of gold.  This seems to reference a world made up of the power of money.  The second stanza continues that idea with the image of failed dreams and the ones we hail (ie: heroes of our society)  \"are the worst of all\".   This continues the idea of a societal picture that is dark and failed.  He also references the idea of greed and then follows it with the biblical reference of \"my kingdom come\".   This all points to the idea of an ideal picture of the world that has been flipped on its head.  Money and false fame are the gods leading the way in this dark picture--and yet they are alluring.   Despite the biblical reference, I don't think the song is smacking of heavy religion and it is not about true demon possession.  It is just figurative language used to drive home his points.\n\nThe song writer feels the presence of this dark society that he is not free of and is both victim and participant in.   \n\nI do see a sense of love in the song and of wanting to protect another from these dark things about the world that he sees so clearly.  However, he knows these parts of the world have hold of him right now and are drawing him toward them.  \n\nHow many young people are not drawn to the ideas of fame and money to some degree?  \n\nLove, however, is an entire different force of nature and it collides with the darker pulls for the songwriter.  He is caught in the the light of his lovers eyes.  The next part could be interpreted two ways.  He writes \"I can't escape this now, unless you show me how.\" This could be a sort of silent plea to his lover to help him overcome the darker and greedier parts of life and to stay in the light of her/his eyes.

It can be about an eating disorder/mental illness, about someone's fears, addiction, instability, etc.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_57": "\nMost people hear this song and think these things: he is singing about being crazy, he is depressed, or he is singing about monsters(demons). In a way, all of these are correct. Let me clear it up for you:\nThis song is about a guy that is in love with this girl. He lives in a world of nothing but bad, bad, bad. Except for her. He wants to keep her away from him because she is so innocent and he has done bad things. He has bad memories that will sadden her. He doesn't want to hurt her. He also can't just set her free because there are so many bad people that she won't be safe without him. He wants to escape this world, and believes she is his only way out. Still looking for a deeper, more satisfying and descriptive explanation? Ok, here I go:\n\"When the days are cold\" means it is dark, depressing and bad.\n\"The cards all fold\" means everyone has given up and is now bad.\n\"The saints we see are all made of gold\" means there are no more saints, they are just golden statues now, all gone and dead.\n\n\"When your dreams all fail\" means no one goes out to follow their dreams, there for they are failing. Also, good dreams are an escape from a bad world. Good dreams coming true is even better. When the good dreams no longer have hope or come to you, they can't come true, which means that they have failed.\n\"The one we hail are the worst of all\" means that no one is good, so there is no one to hail that really would be someone good to hail. no more good role models anymore.\n\"The blood's run stale\" means no one is really living or has a reason to live. There is no good left in the world, so everyone is as good as dead.\n\"I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you\" means he wants to hide the truth of all the bad things in the world from the girl he loves to shelter her, or protect her.\n\n\"But with the beast inside, there's no where we can hide\" means he has done bad things, has bad memories that will sadden or hurt her. He can't hide her from himself because he needs to protect her from everything else that's bad.\n\"No matter what we breed, we still are made greed.\" means everyone, good or bad, had greediness inside of them. They all want something, and sometimes want lots of it.\n\"When you feel my heat, look into my eyes\" means when she feels his warmth, his presence, and goodness, look into his eyes and find the truth about him. That's where his demons or bad memories and sins all hide.\nWhenever he says \"This is my kingdom, come\" he means that the darkness and evil is so common, that's all his world can consist of.\nThe first shred of hope in this song is when he says \"I can't escape this now, UNLESS YOU SHOW ME HOW!\" He is saying the girl he loves is the only thing that can lead him out of this mess of darkness and evil. There is one more line I would like to explain.\n\"Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light\" means the girl he loves is the only light and goodness in his entire world.\nI want to share some of my memories that I connect with this song. When I go to school, everyone saw me as the happy, fearless girl. The one who was strong, brave and always happy. I showed it that way, and made it seem like that's the way it really was. But deep, deep inside, I also had my own Demons. Bad memories. Bad things I've done. And stupid fears that I know I shouldn't be afraid of. This song helps me know that I'm not the only one with a deep, dark, inside. I do have happy things in my life, which is like the lover in this song.\n(Also, check out Carly12's review, it is also is very true)\nWith lots of hope,\nMusicFreakLove\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_58": "\nThis song is basically how I felt coming out of the closet in my youth.

He is struggling to reach a level of close intimacy with someone he loves but is afraid that divulging details of himself would hurt that person. Instead, he chooses to keep his conflicts internal, rather than reaching out for support, until the very end of the song.\n\n\"When the days are cold\n[// depressing days]\n And the cards all fold\n[// emotional state triggers positive feedback loop of negative affect]\n And the saints we see\n Are all made of gold\n[// the ones that society deems as moral authorities are at impossible standards for him to ever reach and quite possibly for anyone to reach.

This is a metaphor for hypocritical society attacking him emotionally, wanting him dead, because of their turmoil that results from their inability to accept his deviance from society's norm. Though, the members of society who are attacking him might possibly have equal deviance from society's norm, but do not stand up for him. Therefore, they wear masks. All of this is a potentiality in his mind; it didn't occur yet. It's just an expectation of consequences that might occur if he exposes himself fully.\n\n\"Don't wanna let you down\n But I am hell bound\n[// he wants to be the best for his loved one, but he can't; he is perceived as evil and will go to hell by society's standards]\n Though this is all for you\n Don't wanna hide the truth\n[// he's hiding parts of himself to protect his loved one, but he wishes that he could expose himself and still be accepting for who he is]\"\n\n. . .\n[chorus]\n. . .\n\n\"They say it's what you make\n I say it's up to fate\n It's woven in my soul\n[// his deviance is not his choice but rather an essence that the universe imposed on him]\n I need to let you go\n[// he can't bear exposing himself fully to his loved one, and at the same time, can't bear concealing it from him/her either.

This in turn, creates an even bigger mess. The mess we left behind... those that really did love us and those that are gold digging will fight over it.

Most priests are meant to be caring and compassionate in times of great distress, and most of the times, when you look into peoples eyes, it tell them that you do care.\nHe also said, \"No matter what we breed we still are made of greed...\". This shows that, no matter how hard we try, sin will still be here. However, to counter that, he says, \"Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light. I can't escape this now, unless you show me how\". I think he is saying to the priest that he is so holy, and he is not. He means that he cannot escape it, unless the priest can lead the way to Jesus. \nLastly, he says these two things: \n\"Curtain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call\nIs the last of all\nWhen the lights fade out\nAll the sinners crawl\"\nand\n\"They say it's what you make\nI say it's up to fate\"\nI think what he is talking about is the Last Judgement, where we will all be called, the light of the universe will fade, and the sinners, or they who did not follow Gods plan for them and sinned against him, will, very unfortunately, be spending eternal tragedy in hell. He, lastly, says that its up to fate, which is true. God has a plan for us. It's not our plan, and we don't make it.

Shortly after Tyler's death, his family and Imagine Dragons started The Tyler Robinson Foundation.\r\nOn the foundation's official website, they share the reason why the foundation was started, along with Tyler's story. It reads as follows:\r\n\"\r\nThe Tyler Robinson Foundation begins with the story of Tyler \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one of many heroes who chose not to let his prognosis dictate his outlook on life. At 16-years-old, Tyler was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare form of cancer.  In the following year leading up to his passing, he was able to touch countless lives.\n\r\nThose who knew Tyler were inspired by his courage, and his insistence on enjoying life and spreading happiness despite the physical and emotional strain of living with cancer. Determined to continue Tyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legacy of creating something positive despite the odds, his family and members of the band Imagine Dragons (who had grown close to Tyler) came together to create the Tyler Robinson Foundation. Below is Tyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own story, penned just a few months before his passing. Some people say that Tyler lost his battle with cancer, but we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disagree more. The real battle is not whether you live or die, but how you respond to the challenge.\n\r\nMY STORY (Tyler wrote it himself)\n\r\nMy name is Tyler Robinson and I would like to tell you my story. When I was 11-years old I got a staph infection in my leg that went septic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the infection spread throughout my body and my organs began to shut down. I spent two weeks in intensive care at Primary Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hospital on a respirator and had seven operations on my leg. I was fighting for my life and many people thought that I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but I fought hard and after five weeks in the hospital and five months on antibiotics \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I was cured.Last year, when I was 16 years old, I noticed I had a lump in my groin. I had been working out so I just thought I pulled my muscle; but it kept getting bigger. I finally told my mom about it and she took me to the doctor. After the biopsy I learned that I had a cancer called Rhabdomyosarcoma. I was told that I had a racquetball-sized tumor near my bladder and that it had spread to my lymph nodes and throughout my body. After a spinal tap they told my parents that my bone marrow was 95% full of cancer. My parents didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me that it was stage 4 because they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to discourage me.It seemed surreal at first, but I was OK with it. Then I went to meet with the doctors and they told me what I was facing. I needed to have 20 rounds of chemotherapy and it would take a whole year. I would also need an operation and six weeks of radiation. I would miss my junior year at Brighton High and some of my senior year. I remember going home and feeling so mad and depressed. I told my mom that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to go through it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not a whole year of it.\n\r\nMy bishop came over that night and gave me a blessing. He told me that people who go through hard things either become bitter and angry, or they learn from it and become stronger. He told me that I had a choice to make. From that night on I chose to be the bigger man.\r\nIn February I had my first set of scans and tests to check on my progress. My doctor came into the room and told us that everyone was amazed that my tumor was gone and I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need an operation. I still needed to go through six weeks of radiation and to continue chemotherapy until the fall. In June the tests showed that my bone marrow was completely clear of cancer. I am now officially cancer free and I will be done with my treatments next month.\n\r\nThis year I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned to be patient and no matter how bad I felt, I pushed through the pain. I found that there is no use complaining or feeling sorry for myself \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help anything. Always try to stay positive and have faith.\n\r\nTyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cancer unexpectedly returned just after writing his story and he passed only a few months later. But his optimism and zest for life stayed with him to the end. He taught those who know and love him the power of positivity and its ability to extinguish darkness even in the face of adversity. We hope that this Foundation can honor his example by reaching out to lift up other children with cancer and the families who support them.\r\nTyler loved music, which was the catalyst for his relationship with the band Imagine Dragons. One of his favorite lyrics during the time he was battling cancer comes from the song \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which says The road to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell. When the band heard about this, they dedicated the song to him at a show \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this was the beginning of a long friendship.\"\n\r\nSources:\ntrf.org/about/\nm.youtube.com/\u2026 (at 3:10) \n\n\n", "comment_79": "\nI was at an Imagine Dragons gig last night and Dan explained this song is about depression and his own battle with it, overcoming it \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_80": "\nI think this is about communication between God \"I can't escape this now\nUnless you show me how\" Personal Struggles for ex..secrets, faults, hidden truths, struggles etc etc...He is saying that when you look him in the eye (to anyone) theres a lot that he has seen done experienced that you necessarily don't know about but I want to shelter you from the things that are \"its woven in my soul I need to let you go\"  evil that have constantly enslaved him (like demons do)...for me it would be pornography...it could be anything. \"RATHER TO SUFFER AFFLICTION WITH THE PEOPLE OF GOD THAN TO ENDURE THE TEMPTATION OF SIN FOR A SEASON\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_81": "\nobviously, these were Illuminati-inspired lyrics. if you dumb sheep would actually use your third eye, then you would see that all newcoming artists are part of the new world order. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_82": "\ni think this is someone that has been left behind in the rapture..\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_83": "\nI think that this song is about a guy who has a very troubled past, a history of self destruction hence the demons within.

Here's my interpretation of its meaning:\n\r\n\"When the days are cold... and the blood's run stale\"\r\n-The singer is talking about a point in his life in which everything seems hopeless. He feels as if he has nothing left to give: his life didn't go as planned, he has lost faith in religion and God, and he has no creativity, energy or courage left in him to start all over again.\n\r\n\"I want to hide the truth... there's no where we can hide\"\r\n-This to me is amazing. He is probably with someone he truly and dearly loves (lets assume it's the love of his life), and he wants to stay strong for her, to keep his demons (the ones we all have within) in check so that he doesn't hurt her. But he knows that he has lost control of them, that at any point they can burst from within and make him do something he will regret, and sadly he can't escape or hide from them.\n\r\n\"No matter what we breed... This is my kingdom come\"\r\n-I think this is an example of him battling against his demons. He knows he should let her go so that she can live a better life without him, but he's human, and humans can be greedy, thus he's battling between being selfish and staying with her, or being selfless and letting her go.\n\r\n\"When you feel my heat... It's where my demons hide\"\r\n-He is finally warning her that he is no good, that she should stay away from him because of his demons. This is him being selfless and choosing to be honest with her so that she can find peace and happiness with someone else.\n\r\n\"When the curtain's call... At the mess you've made\"\r\n-I honestly am having so much trouble interpreting these verses, that I'd rather not comment quite yet. But I do believe he is speaking to a higher power, the one that has been ignoring his prayers (remember he's losing faith)\n\r\n\"Don't want to let you down... Don't want to hide the truth\"\r\n-This it another example of him battling against his demons. Whenever we are having trouble in our lives, it's very difficult to demonstrate vulnerability to another and accept the fact that life is hard and we sometimes need help. He doesn't want to confess to his loved one that he is losing the battle against his demons, but he knows it's true and that she deserves better; he must let her go. It's ironic, though, because by freeing her from his darkness he's ultimately beating his demons in his inner battle. Letting her go is a sacrifice, and by doing so, he's proving himself worthy of her.\n\r\n\"They say it's what you make... Unless you show me how\"\r\n-He doesn't believe he has a choice in the matter, it was his fate to endure the burden of fighting his demons, but not hers, that's why she needs to be free of him. She doesn't have darkness inside, but rather light, and by being with her, he will be robbing her of this. He gives up completely but he does plea for help in the end. The final battle against his demons was won by him, (he warned her about him and let her go), but the war was won by the demons. With his last cry for help, it will be her choice if she wants to be with him despite his inner demons and help him battle against him, or live out her life somewhere and with someone else.\n\r\n\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_96": "\n\"I want to hide the truth\r\nI want to shelter you\r\nBut with the beast inside\r\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nowhere we can hide\"\n\r\nHe has a demon inside of him. He wants to keep his significant other away from the demon to shelter her away from it. Since the demon is inside of him, there is nowhere they can hide to get away from it.\n\r\n\"No matter what we breed\r\nWe still are made of greed\r\nThis is my kingdom come\r\nThis is my kingdom come\"\n\r\nNo matter what offspring we have, we are made of greed, so our offspring will be made of greed. \n\r\n\"When you feel my heat\r\nLook into my eyes\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\r\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get too close\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark inside\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\"\n\r\nHe's calling out for help saying that the demons are inside of him. The demons hide inside of his eyes because that is where I was able to notice my friend who was demon possessed totally change. In his eyes when the demon took over he looked totally different. ( I have dealt with a possessed friend and it is scary ) Don't get too close it's dark inside because if the Holy Spirit is not inside of you it can be filled by anything including demons. He letting the other person know that the demon is inside his eyes, but warning the other person not to get too close because the demon is filled with darkness. (evil). \n\r\n\"When the curtain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call\r\nIs the last of all\r\nWhen the lights fade out\r\nAll the sinners crawl\"\n\r\nIn The Bible when the curtain was torn in two from top to bottom this signified that we can come to God without a high priest going on our behalf.

He doesn't believe he can escape from his demons. They have gained too much ground in his spirit, the only way he can escape is if someone shows him how.

The only saints we have worshipped is gold, money and not the true saints.\n\nthe second verse pertains to our leaders who are corrupt and greedy beyond all else. the blood runs stale is all the useless wars and bloodshed they have caused with their greed.\n\nthe third is how he loves Jesus and doesn't want him to know the truth about his world and himself. He's ashamed and doesn't want to hurt Jesus but knows he cannot hide it from him.\n\nthe fourth is that we all have this sin of greed and were born that way.

His sins were given to him at birth and he has no choice but because of them, this is what he must live with...his kingdom come.\n\nThey say it's up to fate - he is saying he didn't choose to be greedy, it's woven in his soul but because of that he must let Jesus go.\n\nYour eyes they shine so bright. Up until this verse he acts as if he is doomed to be hell bound even tho it was not his choice to be sinful but more just the way he was made but here is a glimmer of hope that Jesus will show him a way out. This is the verse that made me think he was talking about Jesus, this and the kingdom come verse because it relates to the bible.\n\nAlot of people think he is talking to a lover and I thought this too at first but then felt this was deeper than that.

Trying to hide your child from the evil and yet needing to let them know the truth for their own benefit. Your child being so young and innocent as to be able to guide you to the right path. The verse about they dug your grave made me change my mind on this interpretation. the mess you made reminds me of people blaming God instead of themselves for our plight. Anyway, I have pondered this alot and this is what I have come up with. Would appreciate anyone's comments on what they think of this interpretation.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_127": "\ni think that this song is about depression. the person singing is depressed, and doesn't know how to fix it. they believe that, no matter how good their partner is in their life, the depression is \"woven in\" their \"soul\". They want to let their lover go, so that they don't hurt them when they commit suicide. the demons represent the depression that he fights, and plays on the idea that when you become depressed you lose the light in your eyes. This person is breaking inside, and they want there lover to leave before they hurt themselves physically (suicide) and their love emotionally (dealing with the suicide).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_128": "\n1- the singer is describing his back ground and his life :\n\n- When the days are cold  =  in our present world when it is too touph & full of cheating\n\n- And the cards all fold = when all your life crumbles, and when you lose all hope and you fail every thing\n\n- And the saints we see Are all made of gold  =  and all those who pretend to be saints or those whom we thought that they are too good like saints he realized by the end that it was only a deception, and they were just like golden statues made only by our imagination as there is no one is perfect\n\n- When your dreams all fail And the ones we hail Are the worst of all  =  when all your dreams  fail and when the ones you liked most and saw them as your heros he realized that they are the worst of all as they were mean to him\n\n\n2- the singer is talking to the girl that he met and loved, but she is too innocent, pure and good,\nshe is so innocent and pure to the point that he doesn't want to spoil her with his life, the bad person he is, or even to make her see what he saw,\nhe wants to protect her:\n\n- I wanna hide the truth = of what I really became\n\n- I wanna shelter you = I want to protect you and not to harm you because I love you \n\n- But with the beast inside = the person who I became\n\n-  There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nowhere we can hide = we will be lost, and you will be lost\n\n- No matter what we breed We still are made of greed = I became the man who I am because we all make mistakes and are full of greed\n\n- When you feel my heat Look into my eyes  =  if you think I am good for you, when you see me from outside and get admired, just look to in me in the eyes and see me from inside\n\n- It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide = the truth and reality of me is there, inside me as you can only see it through my eyes, my eyes will reflect all my mistakes and weaknesses \n\n- Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get too close It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark inside =  don't get too close, don't know me so deeply, as it is dark inside and I don't wanna spoil you or make you get shocked from my reality, I want to keep my reality to my self\n\n\n\n3- back to the awful reality of his world:\n\n- Curtain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call Is the last of all When the lights fade out All the sinners crawl = at the end when the lights fade out and the show ends all the reality inside the people comes out, all the faked masks fall and there are no real saints\n\n- So they dug your grave And the masquerade Will come calling out At the mess you've made\n = so these people with the lovely masks and nice smiles, those whom I considered as saints, the ones I hailed most are the ones who hurted me most, and they have distroyed me using all my mistakes\n\n\n\n4- talking back to his girl:\n- Don't wanna let you down But I am hell bound = don't want you to suffer with me in my miserable life\n\n- Though this is all for you = even though I wanna leave you alone for your safety\n- Don't wanna hide the truth = I have to tell you why I have to go, I want you to know the truth, so you might change me\n\n- They say it's what you make I say it's up to fate = they say we choose the path, we choose to be good or bad but what I can say is that it is a matter of fate because I didn't choose to be what I am today\n\n- It's woven in my soul = it is printed now inside my soul\n- I need to let you go = for your own sake\n\n- Your eyes, they shine so bright I wanna save that light = I see the goodness in you that makes me see the badness in me, the light in you made me see the darkness in me, and I want to save that innocence in you \" that light\"\n\n- I can't escape this now Unless you show me how = I really love you to the point that I want to change my self for you but I feel that I can't do it by my own, unless you show me how to change for your love\n\nso basically he loved a nice girl that made him think that is not good enough for her and he doesn't deserve such goodness because she is so perfect in his eyes, and at the end he wants her to help him change to be a match for her or he will have to leave for her own sake\n\nthanks for reading and I appologize for my language,\nI am an egyption and that's how I felt the song\nthanks for reading\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_129": "\nI believe this song talks about how all people have two lives: one the public sees, and one only they know about.\n\nIn the first part (\"When the days are cold; and the cards all fold; and the saints we see; are made of gold\"), the singer talks about how when the days get dark and depressing, when everyone seems to have given up, and saints/perfect people are all put on a high pedestal, when people don't really aspire to be like them.\n\nHe also talks about how sin is a part of human nature, and how it's inevitable that you'll commit sin during your life. Everyone is like this. He doesn't want someones innocence to be ruined, but he realizes that it would've happened anyways (\"I wanna shelter you; but with the beast inside; there's nowhere we can hide;\").\n\nIn various parts, the singer seems to be trying to dissuade someone from getting too close (\"Don't come too close; it's dark inside;\"). I think he's trying to warn the person he's talking to from getting too close to people unprepared, or you might not like what you find. Drugs, an abusive family, etc.\n\nThis song does have a positive message (\"I can't escape this now; Unless you show me how;\"). To escape an addiction/deal with problems, you need two people. One person can never break out of something by himself/herself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_130": "\nWhen things look bleak and you find have no more hands to play or moves to make.

And also about everyone's personal demons they have inside. I looked it up, it's stated by the band. \"Breakout band Imagine Dragons has released an emotional music video for new single \u00e2\u0080\u009cDemons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They dedicate the clip to 17-year-old fan Tyler Robinson, who recently succumbed to cancer.\nThe video depicts images of Imagine Dragons performing the song at a hometown show in Las Vegas. Their stage performance clips are juxtaposed with scenes of audience members thinking about their own personal demons; an American soldier recalls harrowing moments on the battlefield; another person deals with the secrets of domestic violence.\nAt the video\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conclusion, director Isaac Halasima has added a snippet from a clip created by Tyler Robinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother Jesse, showing the band dedicating their hit \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Time\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Tyler in concert.

So whatever he's trying to hide is part of him; he can't escape it.\n\nNow to the first chorus. \"When you feel my heat.\" That could literally be his body heat. Or it could be something else. I have a guess, but I'll get back to that later.\n\"Look into my eyes/It's where my demons hide... Don't get too close/ It's dark inside\". I'd infer from this, and other lines in the song, that the person he's talking to is a lady friend of some sort. When she gets close to him his darkness is more apparent. Simple enough.\n\nThe next stanza, \"At the curtain's call...\" Is for the sole purpose of emphasizing the despair of the situation.\n\nBut next we see the \"masquerade\" calling out at the \"mess you made\". Again, I have a guess about the \"mess\", but I'll get back to it later.\n\n\"I am hell bound\". Those are some serious words. But could this be a metaphorical hell? Like the hell he would be in if his G-Friend broke up with him if she found out what he's hiding?\n\nThe last three stanzas are where it comes to the real grit and grind. \"They say it's what you make/I say it's up to fate\". This \"thing\", whatever it is, cannot be helped. It is subject to fate, or luck. Hmm.\n\"It's woven in my soul/I need to let you go\". The whole song is essentially in second person; he's talking to his woman-friend the whole time. But here it changes. He's still talking to someone or something. I'd say something.\nNow, could \"woven in my soul\" be anything other than his literal soul? Could he be referring to the innermost depths of his body instead? I think so.\nWith that context, put this together: \"When you feel my heat... It's woven in my soul.\" Could this heat possibly be woven... in his bowels?\n\nI believe the song is about a man who is trying desperately to hold in a fart, maybe even diarrhea, (call back to mind the \"mess you made\"), because he doesn't want his girlfriend to be subject to the horrible smell.\n\nThis makes even more sense in the next stanza. \"Your eyes, they shine so bright/I wanna save that light\". I think you can assume with plenty of assurance that her eyes won't be shining brightly if he lets out the south wind.\n\nAlthough I'm not sure about the last two lines before the final chorus. \"I can't escape this now/Unless you show me how.\"\nThis implies that his girl can show him how to avoid farting. I have to admit, the song lost me there. But who am I to judge? Maybe she has Beano.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_138": "\nWhen the days are cold, And the cards all fold, And the saints we see, Are all made of gold\n>> When everything darkens and shuts and all we finally see are the lovers with fake faces that deceive us<<\n\nWhen your dreams all fail, And the ones we hail, Are the worst of all, And the blood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s run stale\n>> All hopes for finding love crush like ashes and the ones we've been with are the fakers that stab us and they did not seem to bother the pain they cause us as they let us suffer alone in a world of hatred <<\n\nI wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you, But with the beast inside, There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nowhere we can hide\n>> I just try to hide my pain and misery, keep it secretly from you who think you have won, but even a naked eye can see the scars that burn inside of me and truly there's just no place for people like us (hurt) to recover <<\n\nNo matter what we breed, We still are made of greed, This is my kingdom come, This is my kingdom come\n>> But no matter how you get your ways into crushing me and pushing me down, I will not hide from you any more and I will face you now <<\n\nWhen you feel my heat, Look into my eyes, It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide, It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide, Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get too close, It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark inside, It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide, It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my demons hide\n>> Listen to me, I know you feel this pain you caused me as I know you feel the sorrow every time when I ask you to look into my eyes, but now don't get to close anymore because i'm broken to pieces, this new me you caused me to be will rage in anger and when I unleash it even I, myself can't stop me <<\n\nCurtain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call, Is the last of all, When the lights fade out, All the sinners crawl\n>> Before I end this relationship, I will say that I did not regret it, I gave you my all and pull you out of your dark and lonely world, when this ends you will begin to crawl to where you come from and I will not be there to pull you out <<\n\nSo they dug your grave, And the masquerade, Will come calling out, At the mess you've made, Don't wanna let you down, But I am hell bound, Though this is all for you, Don't wanna hide the truth\n>> People have begin to discover your true intentions, they can see the scars, pain and misery you made.

It is true, but I just want to get past greed so that I can be a successful person in life.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_149": "\nThis song is about Luke Castellan; the ones they hail are horrible. he believes that. this song is so about him...\nbut it also reminds me of me...\nwow...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_150": "\nI was inspired so I wrote this:\n\nnada-gamaleldin.blogspot.com/2015/10/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_151": "\n\"When the days are cold\" is saying when someone died, \"and the cards all fold\" means that no one wants to believe this happened, \"and the saints we see are all made of gold\" means that no one can help him and what has happened. \"When your dreams all fail\" means that you can't have dreams anymore, because you're dead, \"and the ones we hail are the worst of all\" means, again, no one is able to help, even though we hail them, \"when the bloods run stale\" means that's when someone died. \"I wanna hide the truth, I want to shelter you\" means that he wants to have what happened unhappen, \"but with the beasts inside, there's nowhere we can hide\" means that he can't hide from the truth no matter how hard he tries. \"No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed\" means that he was greedy and not ready for this to happen, \"this is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come\" means that his sorrow is how he's going to feel for a while. \"When you move my heat, look into my eyes, it's where my demons hide\" means that if you move his anger and see how he really feels, it shows his sorrow. \"Don't get too close, it's dark inside, it's where my demons hide\" means that he doesn't want any help from his grief. \"At the curtains call\" means when someone dies, \"it's the last of all\" means that that's the last time they will see them, \"when the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl\" means that when you die, you will see all the others that are dead. \"So they dug your grave\" means that they dug up her grave for when she died, \"and the masquerade will come calling out at the mess you made\" means that all those who are sad and don't want to show it will show it at her funeral. \"Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound\" means that he doesn't want her to die, \"but with the beasts inside, there's nowhere we can hide\" means that with the truth, there's nowhere he can hide from it. \"They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate\" means that while everyone thinks that you do things through your choices, he thinks that fate decides, \"it's woven in my soul, I need to let you go.\" means that he needs to let her death go. \"Your eyes they shine so bright, I want to save that light\" means that he doesn't want her to die, \"I can't escape this now, unless you show me how!\" means that he can't get past her death unless she were to show him how.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_152": "\nI feel like this song is about how you hide who you really are for some people, and you don't want to let them down by showing them who you really are.

This song helped me through a difficult year. It has a meaning to me that might not be anyone else's, but I'd just thought I'd share it. \n\r\nFor me, this song is about someone who is afraid of falling for someone. Someone they know they're bound to fall in love with anyway, but they don't want to hurt them, or get hurt themselves. 'Don't get to close, it's dark inside.' \r\nIt seems like this person has had a lot of heartbreak, and has been having a tough time in their life in general. \n\r\nBut later in the song, it turns out they did fall for the person they didn't want to. \r\nThey actually have a chance. They're so close to at least getting a date with the person. \r\nBut then they blow it. They fear rejection anyway. \r\n\"Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell bound.\"\n\r\nSo then their love interest moves on, or so they think. Because the person they had fallen for is now with someone else. \n\r\n\"They say it's what you make\r\nI say it's up to fate\r\nIt's woven in my soul\r\nI need to let you go\n\r\nYour eyes, they shine so bright\r\nI want to save their light\r\nI can't escape this now\r\nUnless you show me how\"\n\r\nHere is the part that means a lot to me. Basically, my meaning to this song is what happened to me a head ago. \n\r\nThe 'love interest' I've been talking about, well he's been forced into relationships he doesn't really want. But I say it's truly up to fate, just like the song says. \n\r\nSo that was what the song meant to me.

That said, when analyzing poetry, you should start with four things; finding the Speaker, or whose point of view is this in, Occassion, or what's happening or what's happened that inspired this poem in a sorts, Audience, or who is meant to hear this and who is the speaker talking to, and last; Purpose, which is what it sounds like, why is this person saying this? To start, let's find the speaker. The line, \"my kingdom come\" is parallel to \"Thy kingdom come\" from the Lord's Prayer in Christian belief. I don't think Dan Reynolds is claiming to be God or anything, but it's a possibility that the song is written from God's POV. Next, occasion. What's happening in this poem (song)? Well, it seems to be that everything is going wrong for this guy, God or not. As the generations pass (I don't know if this is true or not), I think that less and less people believe in themselves or other people, which again, could go with God, though this person could just be anyone. Third, we have audience, who is he/she talking to? In the line, \"unless you show me how\", he/she seems to be talking to someone in particular, though it's just as likely that he/she is addressing a specific group of people who seem to know the way, but can't or won't help this person out. Lastly, we have purpose. \"It's where my demons hide\" seems to imply that this guy wants others to realize that he/she is not perfect, that this person has flaws just like anyone else, perhaps even more so than anybody else. In conclusion, I think it's about a person who is struggling to get across the fact that they aren't who everybody else believes them to be, and that they have bad times and good times, too. Another interpretation could be that, even though I'm an atheist, God is trying to show his followers that he's trying his hardest to keep them happy and healthy, but his hardest isn't enough for him or anyone else, and that despite him being, well, God, he's not quite as perfect as they want or need him to be, and that he needs their help to make this world a better place. I don't know if this is what it actually meant, and I'm sorry for dragging you through this whole explanation, but this is what I thought maybe it meant, so thanks for reading!

Even Dresden himself, to some extent.\n\r\n\"When you feel my heat / look into my eyes / it's where my demons hide\" - Fire being Dresden's preferred element, and again the act of Soulgazing with Dresden reveals something scary within him.\n\r\n\"When the curtain's called / is the last of all / When the lights fade out / All the sinners crawl\" - Dresden literally was forced to crawl after breaking his back rescuing people from a fire; his curtain call would be his accepting the position of Winter Knight.\n\r\n\"So they dug your grave / and the masquerade / will come calling out / at the mess you made\" - happens in Book 3: The Red Court literally dug his grave and revealed it at a masquerade ball; the Masquerade (the act the Supernatural world does on the Natural world) is called out when he starts a massive war with the Red Court.\n\r\n\"Don't want to let you down / But I am hell bound / Though this is all for you\" - Pretty much his attitude through the book series, made especially clear when he takes on the mantle of the Winter Knight to save his daughter. Could also mention just the amount of torture and torment he goes through in each book to protect his friends and stop the bad guys.\n\r\n\"They say it's what you make / I say it's up to fate / It's woven in my soul / I need to let you go\" - Dresden is somehow fated to be an important player in the upcoming war; every love of his life leaves him, and he believes he is fated to be alone.\n\r\n\"Your eyes, they shine so bright / I want to save their light / I can't escape this now / Unless you show me how\" - Whenever Dresden's misery and situation became overly taxing for him, it was his friends - specifically Murphy - who helped to show him how to escape despair. He spends much of his resources in protecting her, to keep her eyes shining bright.\n\n\r\nSo ya - I think that the song is based on the Dresden Files book series. It works too well.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_179": "\nthere's a spiritual side to everything. the Saints, the demons pretty self explanatory. the end. When the cards all fold it's all over. The end of life... Judgement Day. I feel that the soul sometimes cry out, before the mind. The song demonstrates though he's been put into a place where he believes there is no salvation,  he has hope. it is someone close to him, that he doesn't want to hurt but he also knows that this someone could help him. If that is not a cry for help I don't know what is. There is only one answer!! Peace and blessings to those who call upon Jesus..\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_180": "\nI think this song is about bananas\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_181": "\nThis song is about a kid with cancer, ask them yourself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
