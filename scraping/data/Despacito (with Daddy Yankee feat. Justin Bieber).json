Dancing can be very sensual (watch their video clip ... I don't think they are trying to hide that it is about more than just dancing).\n\r\nMost the lyrics deal with that they will win the woman over and \"dance\" with them and they'll love it. Hahaha ... what most men want to believe anyway!!\n\r\nAlso surprised that this is number one on the charts in Australia (not a large Spanish speaking community here ... probably the last Spanish song to rate so high in the charts would have been Las Ketchup. Although it is the Justin Bieber version that is popular in Australia (so a bit of English).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nUMMM daddy yankee is obviusly mama yanke. and i wanna be granpa yanks.
