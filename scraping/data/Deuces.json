{"comment_0": "\nI love this song.  This song was written and produced by Kevin McCall who has the last rap verse in the song.  Chris is making a good comeback.  He is so talented.  This is a song about him leaving his old lover whom he sees no future with so he is saying his farewell and throwing up them \"deuces\" up. He is ready to with a woman who understands him better. He is ready to be with a girl who is ready to devote to him and love him withouat all of the drama. \n\r\n                           DEUCES!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nthis sonq qoes hard !\r\nx\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song is pretty much about him meeting another girl who he 'loves' more than the current girl he is with at the moment; who he is giving his 'dueces' (peace out) to, for said other woman.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI didn't realise it as I am not a fan of hers, but the beat is similar to Rihanna's Te Amo and when you read Te Amo's lyrics, you know why Chris' first line is ideal...but the song runs deeper though\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nthis song is the shit and i aplaude chris brown for this song beacause i like how he stood up for the men that be tryin their best with their females to make them happy \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nA big thumbs up to chris.
