{"comment_0": "\nThe \"carrots\" he is talking about can be viewed metaphorically, but he literally is talking about carrots, which is supposed to be kind of ironic. Carrots are technically living, they might even have a soul, but that doesn't matter when it comes to their harvest - they are eaten by species that are higher in the food chain. If life did not feed on life, then all life would die.\r\nThe irony of \"carrots\" is that they obviously do not have a nervous system, and to the best of our scientific knowledge, they do not feel pain or suffering or anything at all.\r\nBut if we do not care about carrots, why should we care about flies and insects either? Flies have a very simple nervous system, and arguably, they do not feel any complex amount of pain.\r\nIf we do not care about the flies, then why care about the birds who eat the flies? Birds have a relatively simple nervous system, and they most likely do not feel any complex amount of pain.\r\nBut if we do not care about the birds, then why care about the cats that eat the birds? And why care about the dogs that eat the cats? The deer that eat the grass? The pigs that eat their own shit? The humans that eat the pigs?\r\nPain is just a sensation - an electric signal sent along a sequence of organic tissue that is all essentially composed of just ordinary matter: single molecules; protons, electrons, neutrons, etc.. \r\nAll of which ultimately feels nothing, and the sensation of pain was hollow and empty..\n\r\nIt would seem that this song (as well as the entire album) presents us the duality that They/He/It (whether it was Maynard, other members of the band, or just Tool in general) has been afflicted with - the paradox of morality. How can we claim to be for good and against evil, and how can we claim to be righteous, if we have to inflict pain on an innumerable amount of other creatures simply in order to survive?\n\r\nWhat if it turned out that we were all unknowingly on a farm as well, and aliens came to Earth one day to harvest us -- and feed not on our flesh, but torture us and feed on the tragedy produced from our cries of agony and torment?\r\nWithout that tragedy to feed on, the aliens would enter a state of unbearable nihilism due to the lack of any purpose - but when they torture us, it reminds of them of the temporary nature of existence, even their own, and the ultimate mortality of all things. It makes them thankful to exist. Without it, they would die.\n\r\nWas there ever a difference between these hypothetical aliens and the species (whatever it may have been, the song suggests rabbits) that ate the carrots?\n\r\nWhere do we draw the line between right and wrong? There is no possible way to draw an absolute line between \"when it is right, and when it is wrong\", since right and wrong are relative to their observer. Morality is a human invention. But subjectivity does not necessarily imply fallibility. The notions of \"right and wrong\" exist, because we make them exist - but that is it.\n\r\nHowever, considering morality in the case of humanity alone and amongst itself, it can be stated as a fact that our survival requires some degree of unconditional cooperation with each other. Mothers have to love their baby and feed their baby, or else their baby dies. Members of society have to cooperate with each other, or else humanity's more complex desires (such as the arts, technology, higher knowledge, science, etc) would be impossible to achieve. You're reading this on a computer right now. Do you know how to make a computer from scratch? I don't mean  buying the parts and putting it together - I mean harvesting the raw resources from bare earth with your bare hands and no tools besides what you can find for yourself, and then assembling those resources into a computer? I highly doubt anyone on this planet is capable of that. Your charade of a lifestyle automatically drafts you as a member of society's morals and ethics.\r\nDo morals and ethics get out-dated from time to time? Yes. Do we need to revise them? Yes. It's far from perfect, and its highly unlikely it will ever reach perfection. All you can do is find out for yourself through experience what YOU think is the best way to improve the world, and then REPRESENT these ideals of yours by integrating them into your individual persona.\r\nIt is NOT possible to predict these changes/fluctuations in morality and ethics by using logical sciences and measurements alone. There are too many variables involved in the fine-tuning of morality, and breaking it down mathematically is impossible, and even if we could do it, the results would be beyond human comprehension.\r\nYou have to use your intuition gained from experience in conjunction with logical sciences and measurements in order to come up with the best representation you can. Many people do not know it, but most people are already finely-synchronized with morality via their intuition, and they do not even have to worry about it - the perceived disruption occurs when individuals try to exploit the rhetoric and structure of morality for their own personal gain that is unrelated to morality.\n\r\nSo to basically sum it all up:\r\nBased on our subjective experiences, we must use our intuition to participate (with as much effort as we care to put into it) in refining society's morality to resolve to see what we perceive to be its current flaws. When we do this, our persistence and humility will eventually bring us to satisfactory results that we can at least be content with. Some people have it easier than others - and from my perspective, yes, it is morally correct to crash these types of people down whenever they are acting cocky to someone who has to deal with more than them. Maybe that isn't the same for you, maybe it is, and that's the beauty of it I guess.\r\nOur experience here will be worthwhile - but that doesn't mean you are automatically guaranteed satisfactory without having to work for it at a level past your comfort zone.\n\r\nWe can improve our lives, to whatever extent we allow ourselves to.\r\nHowever, it is unknown whether or not we can improve the state of all humanity. \r\nThis might be as good as it gets as far as our world goes, but that's only because society can't hold everyone's hand and wipe their asses for them - they know themselves the best, and only they know how to fulfill their needs the best. The sky is the limit for improving our own lives, because whatever you consider the definition of \"improvement\" to be is up to you..\n\r\nWow this is a long ass comment okay I'm done. There's Tool in a nutshell for you ladies and gentlemen\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song, is divisible into 2 parts, each with a seperate yet connected meaning, hence why there are 2 seperate monologues seperated by the middle chant of the tune;\n\r\nFirst, Maynard is very very obviously poking at relgion. He even uses the sound of sheep in order to make sure that the point is put across to the common person. He is simply saying how powerful education, manipulation, and religion are combined when the only common denominator of the human mind is fear. Fear can be used to make the sheep believe that the carrots are real and alive, and things that logic neglects, such as the rabbits needing glasses, would be ignored and taken for fact.\n\r\nFear is all powerful, and fear of damnation and ideas can change reality in our minds, from the peace and coexistance with all things to which we all share. \"This is necissary. Life feeds on life, feeds on life, feeds on life...\" We must consume in order to survive, the curse of consciousness makes this difficult because of our love for things and one another, we must accept it is the way of things.\n\r\nLast but not least, Maynard's landlord points to something that is the opposite of what he accepts as all things being connected. While we are all connected, it is because we do not own everything or anything, and why \"satan is seen as our cousin, and god as our father in this message, by a \"psycho\" who cannot see that not all things belong to him. the concept of ownership, greed; are not unique to our people (dogs and animals even believe this). Strangley we see that true insanity is believing that everything is yours, while we as people view that ourselves. Nothing belongs to anyone; we are one as a mind.\n\r\nThis is what Maynard says.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nok, well, i know this probably won't really explain the song. but, what i got the vibe from it was that humans are basically animals and are natural. religion and society makes us, as humans, into who we are. Every single time i hear this song, I remember the book \"lord of the flies\" especially at the part where maynard yells \"this is necessary...life feeds on life feeds on...\" And LOTF is a DAMNED good example of humans turning into what we naturally are. Beasts. Recently, in my english class ((which i'm failing because i spend time daydreaming trying to figure what we're here for)) we discussed lotf and that just got my attention. Not to say that my english class is boring, but it doesn't really reach to me, if i'm alone with the teacher, i'm able to understand. ANYWAY...kinda got off topic, the first part of the song i believe is showin how religion basically is a flaw, and shows that religion is just a facade. Facade as in we use religion to make ourselves better, or at least feel better. . . i dunno, i think i'll basically post later when i'm not tired\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nthis is the best explanation i can come up with \n\r\nPart 1:  Televangelist on TV making ludacrous claims, and people follow him, hence the sheep, definitly a religious mockery no doubt. The line life feeds on life feeds on life is saying one organism must survive off another organism to live. \n\r\nPart 2: Crickets- has to do with Part 3, woke up in a ditch, this is the sound of who ever it was sleeping in the ditch. \n\r\nPart 3: has to be about life being connected, i didnt get the idea i had now until i listened to Vicarious and thought about it.  remember Life Feeds on Life, basic survival, one organism must survive off another organism to live, if you are an animal, you kill other animals, take land away from other animals. okay now. human perspective.  He thinks Everything is his, he took the territory, its his, he sees the sky, its blue, its his color, he is covered in goo(blood, possibly killing who ever was on the land, so now he is claiming it as his own. he wipes the goo(blood) off of this hands onto the green grass, and now his color is green b/c he saw the grass and if the grass is green than his color is green. when he says why does everything have to change he is refering to the colors changing and his wants changing. new color new posession. when he says waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you, i get this vibe now, he thinks all these things are his because he cant rememeber. he sees the car and thinks its his car. the god and satan thing may be in their because his memory is coming back to him, and why doesent anyone else understand these important things?, i think the man is establishing a state of empowerment and he feels like he is better than everyone, he is coming out of his confused and head aching state into a more \"clear\" state of mind.He gets to the car and tries all the doors, locked, meaning its not his car, funny that he doesnt check for keys or anything.mabey he knows its his car(thinks it is anyway) but doesnt understand what it does, hence he wouldnt know he needs keys, he just knows its locked. like when people wake up with brain damage and dont know who they are or what is theirs or who their family is or where they are but they know how to speak and they know what everyhign is like a bed, a chair, a bowl. expensive leather camera case laying in the seat. it belongs to the people who are in the field by the woods,( taking pictures, mabey bird watchers) you begin to walk toward them. the guy is wanting to kill i would suppose. your color is red, this is strange, his color should have been red when he saw the car and it should have turned to the color of the field/ woods/ people when he saw them. mabey his color is red now because he want to kill them but i dont think so. i think its red because he wants the red car and when he sees the people he knows he can get the car by killing them so he sees red, like its his mission to obtain the red, so when he walks toward them, he thinks red becuase he knows if they are dead than its his. and of course those little people out their were your too.  well he is now thinking these are his people, that they belong to him like the car and the grass and the sky, so mabey he doesnt want to kill them. or mabey this means he has killed them and they are now his.....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nwhat i got out of the song is that when we first start finding out about life and when we are actually old enough to understand some of the things that go on, we realize that life is brutal. we always here about what is wrong and what is right and we are never able to make choices for outselves without getting crap from at least 1/3 of the people you know. everyone is so overwhelmed about trying to be politically correct that we lose ourselves. i think that \"cries of the carrots\" is just an anology for how much we have lost. kind of a metaphor for all the little things we take for granted. and we don't really see how important some things (or people) are until we are put in a desperate situation. when i first heard this song my brother said that it was \"amazingly kickass, who else [but tool] could make a song about carrots!?\" but after i listed to the song more, and heard more of the lyrics i saw so much more. i guess this may be a little far fetched to some, but the main reason i love tool (and maynard james) is that their songs are the ones that can truly make me think. its like a verbal rubix cube. i always have to try to find hidden meaning, and try to find something that is significan to my life.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n", "comment_5": "\nGiven there are many possible meanings to this song, to me it seems like its about how people will follow an idea without question, just because it's accepted among the masses as politically correct, or its what their friends next door are doing. They don't interept things to form their own opinions, they follow ignorantly..like sheep\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nIn the Tool FAQ, it is mentioned that Maynard spoke of Disgustipated in an interview.  Remember how the story at the close of the song sounds like a recorded phone message?  Turns out it was a message from the landlord recommending he pay the rent.\n\r\nAs for the song, well, there are three portions.  The first seems to be a humorous giggle mocking the use of religion in the context of a Reverend speaking to cattle, or sheep from the sounds of it.  Once again, this was inspired by the look an audience gave Maynard during one of his earlier shows with the Melvins.  He noted the blank expressions on their faces and began \"bah-\" ing at them, mocking their also subservient expressions.  I would assume he uses this part to illustrate our complacent tendency to serve and observe -- blindly and almost apathetically.\n\r\nThe central portion, well, it's a loop-based phrase.  Life cyclically feeds on life, energy in all organisms comes from the consumption of other organisms, at least multi-celled organisms, anyway, since most are too large to directly harvest and digest an adequate, carbon-based form of ATP and other vitamins and minerals directly.  It's instinctual to consume for every animal, be it herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore.  We consume, and we justify it all -- we feed on the idea that -- this is necessary.  Everything we are doing is right and necessary to survive.  As the mood darkens and gunshots are heard, our sights broaden to remember that we do more than eat genocidal quantities of carrots, we invade, burn, break, kill, and slaughter, too.  In the rush of the moment, we, too, think it is necessary, we tell ourselves it is.\n\r\nThe last part is an eerie calm, something to unsettle you -- put you on edge.  It is ended with the aforementioned story -- a short psychological tale that has no face and little explanation.  A man wakes up in a daze covered in what he calls red goo with a knife, a missing camera, and a locked car.  \"If God is our Father, Satan must be our cousin,\" says the speaker, a simple note to set the closing mood of this song.  This acknowledges that humankind isn't all consumptive destruction, but we are all equally capable of every cruelty Hell theoretically has to offer.  As the speaker follows the two people he sees walking by \"his woods,\" the speaker claims they are, \"his too.\"  It's an eerie way to word it, but an effective one, they are his next victims and they have invaded his space, tread too close.  We don't know what has happened or what will happen, but I'm sure you all have an idea.

If they \"let the rabbits wear glasses\", then the rest of the foodchain would cry out. \"For them it would be the holocaust...\" And, perhaps a little birdwalk here, but what of all those for whom the spreading of Christian ideas has been the holocaust?

Rednecks are always saying they're getting abducted, they're always talking about how much they love Jesus in spite of their intense hatred for Yankee city folk (red car, expensive leather camera case), it's rural, the speaker of the sermon has a southern Evangelist accent...all of this really adds to that atmosphere.\n\r\nI'm not saying Tool made a song about how stupid rednecks are (but god rednecks are so flippin dumb and shallow, they are going to slowly kill me and eat me); but they are a good example of how misguided religious piety goes awry.\n\r\nBut God are those not the best ambient sounds ever?

When the landlord Bill talks about the making colors of your own like the blue/sky, green/grass, and red.

What this is doing is making fun of religion, dogma and ethics in general with the lines: \"This is necessary. Life feeds on life.\" It kind of relates to and suggests how ridiculous religious leaders and thier dogmatic \"dos and don'ts\" can be, but it doesn't really tell us the full picture of what this song is about.\n\r\nThe second part concludes the song perfectly; it offers the point of view from a wondering serial killer.\n\r\nIn the first part of the song, the serial killer was supposedly attending the preacher's sermon, but then after it was over he hit the road and kept thinking \"This is necessary. Life feeds on life. That preacher was such an idiot\". He walks until nightfall and decides to sleep in a ditch off of the road, and this is where the second part begins - with the crickets churping through the night.\n\r\nThe story ends with him going to sleep that night, but we are given an epilogue as to what he is going to the very next day.\n\r\nThe next day he wakes up and decides to declare that all life, from plants to humans are equal and that killing people is no different from killing carrots now. He also wants to declare the world he lives in to be his; he plans on living like a chameleon- invisable to the world and essentually feeding off of other people's apparent stupidity and petty squabbles over religous beliefs. He essentially blames God for creating us one way and then expecting us to be another way, and the song also seems to suggest that he sees God as no better than Satan because he created Satan, and then allowed him to put us in the state we are in today. These being his thoughts, he decides to kill the two sight-seers by \"his woods\", and steal thier car for his new life hence the line- \"Now red was your color, and those little people out there were yours too\"\n\r\nAlso, the way the song is written, the serial killer seems to also be a fugitive from justice who is also on drugs, and the goo that is described is probably sewer discharge that got on him while he was sleeping in the ditch, but these are just theories and these aspects are not really important to the story.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_60": "\nIf I summed this whole story up in one phrase, then it would be this: \"God made this world, and he wanted it to be just the way it is now, so why should we care?

I know, it's very confusing; This song may be one whole story, but it's divided into two parts in a way that can greatly confuse the audience into thinking that it's just a bunch of random nonsense when it really isn't... but I guess this is MJK's way of being mysterious. I find it quite annoying.\n\r\n\"You looked up at your sky then. That made blue be your color.\" \n\r\nThis line tells us that he has become like a chameleon and wanting to be invisable to the world.\n\r\n\"You had your knife there with you too.\"\r\n\"You tried all the doors. They were locked. It was a red car and it was new\"\r\n\"You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color, and of course, those little people out there were yours too\"\n\r\nThese lines tell us that he's a serial killer who killed  two people. His color was \"red\" because he wanted to take the new car for himself by killing the two people who owned it so that he could take the keys to thier car and steal it.\n\r\n\"There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field you could see two tiny people walking by your woods.\"\n\r\nThis implies that the two people were traveling sight-seers taking pictures into the woods. They had stopped in the middle of the road to do this.\n\r\n\"If God is our Father,\" you thought, \"then Satan must be our cousin.\" Why didn't anyone else understand these important things?\n\r\nThese lines reveal to us his inner madness of comparing God to Satan and placing his own blame on the world from his own selfish point of view. He essentually is saying, \"To hell with religion. At this rate I'll never know the real truth behind anything, and I'll die living exactly the way *I* want to.\" And he does this by considering ALL life to be equal.\n\r\n\"You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you.\"\n\r\nThis implies that he lost his mind over trying to philosiphize and come to his own conclusions about the world he lives in.\n\r\n\"Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this. You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. Your head was almost empty.

Not sure if this explanation was saying we need to throw away the concept of God for our continued evolution (as the Bene Gesserit did in Dune) or if it was relating the \"middle men\" that Maynard is against to the Bene Gesserit; people who appear to love but are really only pretending so they can achieve their goal of the Kwisatz Haderach, and the middle men pretend to believe in God but are really only pretending so they can achieve their goal of control.\n\r\nNow that I think about it, this might've been an explanation about why Tool included Dune on their reading list. \r\nAnyway, this just kindof came to mind.. so, what do you guys think?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_68": "\nThe first section is, quite obviously, what person after person has claimed it to be. A preacher says that carrots should not be harvested because the carrots will scream, which indicates pain of some sort. The people blindly follow what he says (hence the sheep). Then, as if in complete contradiction of that first section (really, it is in complete contradiction) the voice chimes in saying life feeds on life. This is true, of course; the carrots have to be harvested to sustain the life of others. Their organic life is destroyed for the continuation of anothers. This is the cycle of life. hence, this is nessesary.\n\r\nNow, everyone already knows that. Theres no need to explain it really, its extremely simple. The second part, the message left on the answering machine, that is a truly difficult thing to interperet. I always interperted the colors as being a means of showing the persons standpoint that the landlord is refering to in his message. He changes colors from blue to green to red. When he looks to the sky, he is blue. I have always believed that this represents that he is of God, a follower. He then comes to realize his condition: the knife, the goo, he's just crawled up from out of a ditch, these things taint his blue with the red of Satan, and now he is green as he wipes his hands in the grass, as if an admission of some kind of guilt. He wanders off down a road, believing everything he sees to be his. He tries to get into his car but its locked, and he sees his camera bag sitting open on the seat. He searches around, and sees the couple standing in his field near his woods. He storms over to them, and now red is his color, as he is going to kill them and get back from them his car and his camera, and they themselves too. The mention of God being his Father and Satan his cousin (even though, as someone else pointed out, Satan, a fallen angel, would be his brother, their fathers both being the lord) is to clue us in to what the colors represent. Possibly, it also stands to put out that God may be equal to another, hence the fact that Satan would be our cousin. Or maybe the person is wrong, and that would be the reason why no one understood him. Either way, its just my interperetation of it.\n\r\nOr maybe Maynard had a psychotic landlord named Bill who had a pecilur way of evicting people. Who knows, only Maynard, really. So why dont you ask him.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_69": "\nI love reading all these theories...lot's of them are very well thought out, and even if we will never get it from the proverbial horse himself, I think the horse would like the idea that he's promoting thought and questioning.  For lots of artists, they want recognition, popularity, money...to be liked.  Maynard...he wants us all to wake up, himself included.\n\r\nThe first part I believe is poking at any dogma or thought that promotes stupidity and failure to recognize reality.  Whether it be Scientology, Roman Catholicism, Vegetarianism, or even as mundane as simple interpersonal relationships, the way we believe we should treat each other, and ourselves.  So much of is is engineered to make us feel meaning to our existence, when there isn't any.  All throughout Tool's music, you can hear his anger at any stupidity...this subject matter simply frothed his anger into seething rage, and thus into an artful expression for us to enjoy.\n\r\nThis...is...necessary.  Life...feeds on life...feeds on life...feeds on life...feeds on THIS.\n\r\nWhy the dramatic pauses?  Why the repetition?  What is necessary?  That we must eat to live, certainly, and to do that we must kill...whether it be animal, vegetable, or even mineral.  However, I don't think this covers the full scope of what he's saying, or why he is saying it with such conviction, such rage, and such incredibly intent and directed fury.  Everything is necessary, hatred so that love can exist, lies so that truth can exist, and darkness so that light can exist.  Is it necessary because we need to recognize this is the proper way to think so we can set our rules accordingly?  No, it's necessary because the rules are already set.  We simply need to recognize them.  And with the level of adamant grasp on our pomp and importance that we all hold so dearly, someone needs to grab our collective and shake the shit out of it.  Hence the yelling, the repetition.  He doesn't want us to see, he is trying to force it because he's tired of being the only one that gets it.\n\r\nAs for the last part, I don't really find it's origin important at all.  If anything, I think it's an important illustration that who says it doesn't matter, it's the message that is important.  The belief that who says it matters is why a preacher can whip people into a carrot saving frenzy.  What, not who.  From musician, to congressman, to trash man.  Anyway, I think it's about a psychotic.  It's not a raving psychotic, though.  It's a lucid willful psychotic.  A man who believes he's fully recognized the reality of his world and his situation.  His situation being that we all are absolutely nothing.  We have no meaning, we have no purpose, we have no higher dogmatic law, and the things that control our actions are the same things that control gravity, molecular structure, and everything...everything.  As such, he has taken his place as an insignificant atom in our world.  As such, everything he sees is him...is his experience.  Blue is his color, he sees the blue and lets it wash over him so that he is his station in the natural order, a part of the sky.  It gives him a fullness of emotion in the same way that painters see sun rises.  He experiences every instance completely, and he has no hesitation, regret, or moral compass to guide him.  There is no morality when you are only an atom in a sea of blue, there is just blue.  The goo is most likely the ditch, and possibly blood as well.  The goo doesn't matter, what matters is that he doesn't care that it's anything other than goo.  He just wipes it off, sees the grass, and then he experiences everything that is green.  Completely seperate emotions than blue, but still an uncontrollable swirl.  The rest of the song follows the same guidelines.  His powerlessness to alter anything as he's only swirling in the maelstrom (nervous again, why did things always have to change).  Then trying to let his head come back as he couldn't remember things, he was lost in the sea, existing without conscious thought.  He's a willful psychotic, so he wants to feel all this, but he still tries to grasp frantically for any steering that he can. If God is our father, then Satan must be our cousin.  The way he is able to experience all of this so fully and feel no need to have a moral compass is because he has recognized that he is evil as well as good.  Not evil in the way you and I see that we did something bad, but then try to justify why we did what we did.  He doesn't justify at all, because evil is his heart as much as good is, and to him they are the same thing.  The car most certainly wasn't his, but to him, everything belongs to him and he belongs to everything.  The camera case caught his eye because it was abnormal.

No. What I DO believe is this:\n\r\nI think it's funny how this song perfectly describes the thought, \"Who are we? Of man, of flesh and blood, to determine what is good  and evil?\" When the preacher says his speech, when the crazy psycho talks, even when, \"This is nessesary!\" appears all describe that point of view. I think it is also important to note the song structure goes from one side of the scale of right and wrong to the other which I will explain later on.\n\r\nObviously the preacher in the beginning is chanting to his followers who respond with sheep calls. (Note: Bible frequently references Jesus's followers as sheep to his shepard, or God) So sometimes it's hard to determine who you are truely worshipping. God? Or some mortal that thinks s/he can damn/praise anything evil or good.\n\r\nThe middle, where the chanting begins, reflects the harsh reality of the world. The dog chases the cat, the cat chases the mouse, etc. The reason for the chant is because it shows the harsh world turns, survival of the fittest. The reason for the gritty sounding clockwork supports this too; as the world turns, like clockwork.\n\r\nWhen the psycho talks, he takes this view to a harsh extreme. To the point where there IS no God because there is no good or evil. Therefore, no reason to have morals. Everything is his because he is simply existing (like previously stated). Now I'm probably going to contradict myself here, but this last part still vexes me like it does to most of you. Who said the person in the story killed anyone? We only assumed it... why? To answer this, I think we need to look at what we associate the color red as. Most consider it a color of rage, fury. But if that's the case, what do the other colors represent in this story? Why is he trying to get the goo off his hands by wiping them on the green grass? What does the green represent? When he looks up into the sky, what does the blue represent? Just some things to bring into light.\n\r\nAs far as song structer... this can go with Part A (Being the fenatic preacher) Part B (Being the chanting) and finally Part C (The \"psycho\") Part A establishes a solid foundation that states, \"We can't claim what is good and evil because we are not God.\" Part B establishes harsh reality that it is a survival of the fittest story of life; hence life is death and death is life. Part C Shows the opposite side of the spectrum. The side that claims that since we can't establish what is good and evil, good and evil can't exist. This further explains that there is no moral value to life because morality is determined by what is good and evil. It is also important to note that this also fortifies what I previously explained. Since we don't have all the answers, we cannot claim that there isn't a good and evil ether. Ultimately, we have to arrive somewhere in the middle; realizing that, since we are mortals, we can't claim what good and evil is moreover, even exists. But we can determine that life and death is harsh but nessesary.\n\r\nOff topic:\r\nAs far as if there is a God, I like to reply with this message, \"There is a definite possiblity of a divine being because we can imagine it, unlike a squared circle.

If you refuse to eat red meat because you think its wrong to kill something, then you shouldn't eat anything at all! Eating fruits and vegitables are the same thing because they are living organisms just like any other living thing. \"Life feeds on life....\"\n\r\nI am a vegan and i disagree with you completely.  Eating an animal and eating a plant is a completely different thing.

I would ride my bike to her house twice a week.  She had a riding lawnmower that I could use.  She had an old farmhouse with an old barn.  It would take me a good two to three hours to cut the lawn using the riding mower and then going around the trees and such with the push mower.  About this time I had been listening to Undertow over and over again.  I figured there was some sort of defect with my CD player because after \"Flood\" the tracks simply started rolling over one after the other with nothing playing.  As I sat in my parents garage one rainy summer day rolling joints with a friend I did not get up to restart the CD after the \"Flood\"...That was when I discovered \"Disgustipated\".\n\r\nIt came on as like in a dream,\"And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber.\" The entire carrot holocaust was a hilarious concept.  O the horror of the carrots!  How funny!  Then the reality that \"Life feeds on life...\"  Those words spun through my head as I rode around on the mower on those summer days.  Then the daydreams began.  I imagined going into the house and striking the old lady with a frying pan while her bedridden husband sat helplessly watching me destroy his home.  \"This is neccessary..\" chanting in my head.  Of course this gave way to much darker thoughts which eventually manifested into one concrete eduring vision.  The following is the enduring vision I have constructed after continual careful examination of \"Disgustipated\"\n\r\nI am older now.  Through much trials and tribulation I have achieved a level of affluence very few people have ever known.  My possessions are many, my friends are numerous, as are my enemies.  All of the success I have found was brought by my design.  By reading and understanding the behavior of people.  By using the Gifts given me by God.  By playing the games.  I have constructed for myself a Manor of exquisite beauty and amazing architecture.  Every smallest detail has been looked after.  The Spanish marble on the floors, each stone hand-picked for its design and color, the hand carved wood trim made from trees hand-picked from the Amazon jungle, the shape and location of the windows so as to illuminate certain pieces of art on specific days of the year, all of this by my design.  As a celebration of excess I hold a gala.  I invite heads of states, princes, sheiks, CEOs, and eccentric billionaires.  But I know they are all phony.  They smile in my face when it benefits them, they stab me in my back when there is gain to come of it.  Of course, this is all part of the game. It is the game that excites me!  Bringing a man to hand over, willingly and enthusiastically, his time and possessions by my mere words, that is the reward.  My gala is the endgame.  I am so excited because I know what lies in wait.  I have specially constructed my home for this event.  Everything I have done to gain wealth and power leads to this.  The main ballroom of the house has 64 ft ceilings.  It is a rotund room with 6 doorways and two grand stairwells leading to a balcony which overlooks the dance floor.  In the center of the floor is a greenish circle with a green ray leading to each doorway.  The room has been built so that the floor can be lowered and the center circle can rise like a spire.  As my guests come in, with all the etiquette and diplomacy they can muster, they will congregate in the main ballroom as they await the host. Mel Brooks said the difference between comedy and tragedy is that a tragedy is the bad stuff that happens to you, but if it happens to the other guy its comedy.  This was definitely one of those times.  As all the guests stand waiting for the host, the lights go out.  Metal blast doors drop in front of each doorway as the floor begins to slowly sink.  Then it begins, strobes and police lights begin flashing and I rise up from the center as the floor drops below me.  I have a full leather body suit with mask.  \"Life feeds on life..\"  begins playing at deafening levels.  I carry an oversized mace that begins swinging and randomly striking through skull and brains.  Screaming and agony are all that is left for those below.  Then the floor begins to retract into the walls.  Bodies plummet into a pit laden with 4 foot sharpened spikes.  And mingling between the spikes are starving warthogs.

Christians see it as a holocaust:\n\r\n\"They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul!\"\n\r\n... and some resort to either extraordinarily ridiculous and failure prone demands (eg: rabbits wearing glasses, teenage abstainance).  When that fails, violence erupts (eg: abortion clinic bombings) and whatever message of good in religion is lost in the fervor (\"this *bang* is *bang necessary\") as great harm is done.\n\r\nAt least in my interpretation, it seems as if the preacher and followers are shooting at the rabbits to protect the carrots, doing harm to a greater sentient being to protect a lesser one (if even sentient at all). Christian dogma (though not all denominations(sects)), for example, holds that under no circumstances, even to save the life of the mother, may an abortion be performed.  They also feel those single-celled embryos on ice are little human beings, and that experimenting with them is genocide (hurting those who are sick).  Sadly, those very same idiots also run our government.   Regardless of what people feel about abortion, banning it (as many pro-life Christians would like to do) would result in back-alley / coat-hanger abortions which could very well be lethal.\n\r\nIt's important, also, to distinguish between most Christians and the real  wack-job fundamentalists (as should be said about any religion).

There's a couple things you could pull outta the first verse, it's pretty straightforward.\n\r\nSecond part is major serial killerific. To me, it seems like the person is talking to himself, as if there's separate parts of his conscious. I see a person who does horrible things, but separates the evil he does by way of the 2nd person. A person with one complete mind would have to come to terms with what they did, while this guy is just concerned with waking up groggy and oblivious.\n\r\nHe wakes up, covered in blood and with a knife. A normal person would first think 'holy shitballs, what have i done,' then probably figure themselves to be a werewolf... with a knife. This guy just wakes, looks around, wipes off the goo.\n\r\nI think the colors refer to emotion. He looks at the sky, and sees blue. Blue is the color of calm, and calm is how he acts, which is the complete opposite of what you would expect, another hint of psychosis.\n\r\nHe wipes the goo on the grass, and green is now his color. Green is the color of nature, jealousy, greed and discord. This is reflected in his disorientation, and also in his possessiveness... of everything. He sees the car, and now it's his.\n\r\nHe notices the people in his woods, and now his color is red like the car. The color of rage and anger, and blood. The cliche 'seeing red' comes to mind.\n\r\nI dont think those little people are aliens. You could interpret it in 2 ways. The guy is some psycho who thinks he's god, the universe belongs to him and all the creatures in it are inferior to him. Total narcissist, psychopathic serial killer personality. Or, the first thing that came to mind was just that they were off in the distance and the fact that they are \"little people\" just shows his state of mind. We wouldn't say someone who's far away is little, we'd just say they're far away. But this guy is irrational and the fact that there's a great distance between them doesn't register with him. He sees the world differently, so they aren't far away, they're little.\n\r\nAnother clue about the serial killer is the fact that the 2nd verse isnt negative at all, despite the evil he's done and will do. It's just descriptive, as if the man has no moral compass and can't distinguish between right and wrong.\n\r\nOr he was high on shrooms and woke up covered in cow shit.

People follow religion like sheep, not stopping to think about how ridiculous said religion's claims might be.  The second part of the song, while I will acknowledge is probably a message left by the landlord, I have another theory about also.  It seems to be a parable of sorts about a person being born into this world as an adult.  He wakes up poor (in a ditch) because when we come into this world we have nothing.... except that we are equipped from birth with weapons and the capability to hurt others (the knife).  He's covered in goo because when we are born we're covered in goo... probably the clearest indication, to me, that this is a metaphor to an adult being birthed.  The first thing he sees in this world is the sky, so he claims it as \"his\", partly because children think of everything they see as theirs, but also because people seem to think they can own everything, even the sky.  ditto the part about the grass.  He climbs out of the ditch and goes along a road to his car.  To me this kind of seems to symbolize the journey of life.  There is a camera in the car to symbolize how most of us are just spectators who go through life watching everyone else do stuff for us.  The people he sees near \"his\" woods (ditto as the sky and grass) are his parents, and he's trying to escape them in the car on his own journey of life, as many of us do.  This story just seems to be trying to pick out every shortcoming of the human race in a few short passages.

The sounds are of an animal, presumably a deer being hunted by a rifle. The drums are the hoofbeats, you can hear a rifle bolt being worked and then shots fired. After the last shot there is a glass shatter of the rifle bullet entering the animal, glass signifying that the act cannot be undone, you cannot put together a pane of glass that has been shattered and you can't take a bullet back. Then the drums continue as the animal runs then they stop as a squeaky guitar sound gets higher and higher. This is blood flowing from the animal as it's mind fades to black on the ground and all that is left are the sound of crickets.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_159": "\nIn my opinion, the derranged speaker in the latter half of the song see's this red car which he believes to be his (as he seems to possess everything he lays his eye's upon), where in fact it actually belongs to the couple by the woods who have their camra with them to take some pictures. He sees red, red is his new colour, he is angry, he has a knife and is going to kill those people walking and taking pictures by his woods with his expensive camera.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_160": "\nI believe the face value of this song is obvious.  'life feeds on life, this is necessary'  It is just saying what we all are basically.  We must eat to survive, and to do that we must eat life in one shape or another. So what I get out of it is vegetarianism* is kinda pointless because it is denying nature.\n\r\nFun Fact of the Day:  I read in the Revolver magazine on tool that one of Tool's earlier concerts was sponsered by pro-life vegitarian activists type people and after the show the leader came up to Maynard and said \"wow that song (she was refering to disgustipated) was great!\"  Just goes to show the ignorance of some of the people out there.  \n\r\nI would reccomend any tool fan to pick up a copy of it, there is alot of discussions just like this specifically from the band members in the magazine.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_161": "\nThis song is about Maynrd's personal feeling towards ridiculous religions that manifest themselves among Americans, and how it makes him disgustipated. This particular lyrics dipicts a religion based on saving carrots, which is moreover just for comedic value, I'm sure. 'Let the rabbits wear glasses!' (carrots improve eyesight). Maynerd continues by explaining that life feeds on life, that's just how it is, and it's necessary. \r\nAs for the ending spoken passage, this was a message left from Maynerd landlord. Proof in the FAQ and in there is a small note inside the the album art saying 'call the landlord.' \n\r\nGotta love subtle Tool.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_162": "\nwhy are everyone so based around one line. like everyone is taking the carrots line and basing the song around that. what about everything other word. what about the music? \r\ni think this song is making fun of religion and their beliefs to push religion. the preacher preaching is all a whole idea. kinda like a preacher telling the society whats wrong and right.\r\nand then the \" this is necessary\" line is what the religion is saying. such as pushing their religion and trying to convert others into that religion is right.\r\nif you notice, you can hear a new born lamb being sacrificed which shows the religion with do extreme things for the religion. when you hear the, this is necessary line, you can hear shotguns going off, which represents the people in the religion crushing all opposing thoughts to this religion. \r\nso tool is saying religion is stupid. and it shouldnt be pushed. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_163": "\nI think that the first part, from 1:10-2:33, is Maynard mocking how gullibly people (or as I think Maynard would put it, \"sheeple\") are that they could fall for anything if it's exciting. The salesman-like tone of voice that the preacher has is almost believable, but he speaks nonsense. Definitely mocking reverends. The next part is \"this is necessary\" repeated. I think that the power behind it is undeniable and that the point is that an idea can be hammered into people's heads if they hear it enough, and I think the \"this\" in \"this is necessary\" refers to the chanting of the actual lyrics. In other words, Maynard is saying that him saying \"this is necessary\" is necessary! I think that the \"life feeds on life feeds on life...\" means that life will always feed on other life, because it's a cycle.\n\r\nIn all, I think that the song is a statement more than a story, unlike a lot of Tool songs.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_164": "\nPeople who claim to be vegetarians will not eat meat because the believe it is wrong to kill animals. \"Why,\" I once asked a friend who was vegetarian.\r\nShe responded by saying that, \"It's wrong to kill animals.\" \r\n\"So killing plants is okay?\" I said.\r\n\"It's different. Plant's don't feel pain.\"\n\r\nMy point in telling you this is that even though things don't feel pain does not justify an action. If you refuse to eat red meat because you think its wrong to kill something, then you shouldn't eat anything at all! Eating fruits and vegitables are the same thing because they are living organisms just like any other living thing. \"Life feeds on life....\"\n\n\n\r\nThis last part I just wanted to toss in because it related to what I was talking about and I feel it is important:\n\r\nNow I don't know if Maynard is Pro-Life or Pro-Abortion, but the same thing is as follows. People claim that abortion is acceptable because a fetus does not feel pain. Oh, that is such of a disgrace! Like I stated earlier, just because it doesn't feel pain does not justify an action.\n\r\nThe last part of the song is hard to interpret, but maybe it has something to do abortion (the knife and goo, the two people off in the woods [maybe they were making love, who knows]). \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
