When i first listen to a new song i critique it and naturally expect certain things from it kinda like when you listen to a song and you can guess the lyrics even tho you've never heard it.  he says everybody here's got somebody to lean on and then i hear shiver? im like whoa.  but the thing is i never get tired of the song.  When i hear this song it just makes me think of the beauty of the world. Look at the sky. It is amazing. i sound like a Stoner when i say that but i mean really......think how beautiful this world is and we take it for granted.  When i say that i am talking about Nature. Humans have created thier own problems.  Don't blame your problems on God.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nmike27\n\r\nThis song possesess very influential but conscious material. The song focuses around the Rapture. and how everyday life and routines will someday come to a hult, and the world will come crashing down and those who believe they are annointed by their \"God\" will be saved. for example if you look at the end of the video the Band is on a raft and are soaring through the heavens (atmosphere) away from harm. and the line 'There's nothing here to run from' 'Cause, yeah everybody here's got someone to lean on'.i believe means that when the world ends (cataclysm begins) people should not reflect any fear but cherish the moments they have with those who are very important to them. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThe thing I like most about Coldplay is that they don't pretend they've got it all figured out.  I guess I'm talking about Chris Martin since he writes the lyrics.  Anyways there is a modesty to them. They exude this fragility, like an innocent boy in a world of men.  It's not that they are blissfully ignorant or that they are infallable, but they acknowledge this and choose to see the beauty instead.  They may get down or not have anyone to talk to sometimes, but in the end they remember the beauty of the world.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis is easily about Doug adam's Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.

If you bothered to read the rest of the series, you would know that the idea of home is a recurring theme that Arthur becomes less attached to throughout the books as he realizes the insignificance of a home because of how it keeps a person from seeing as much of the Universe as he can in his life. The verses refer to the battles that are constantly being fought over the ownership of planets in the book and the futility of war. THe chorus is an ironic statement on the attachment a person or race feels to their world, although their \"world\" is just their point of view and the significance of that world could be nought if they saw it from another's point of view. As for the last verse, it refers to the fact that Arthur realizes he doesn't need to continually run from place to place, he can depend on the hospitality of others as he hitchhikes through the galaxy. Seriously, read the books and you'll get a deeper meaning of what the song is about.

This is generated through both the lyrics and melody. \"Bones sinking like stones...\" provides the pessimist's view that we are all subject to inevitable suffering, while \"We live in a beautiful world\" reveals an optomistic view.  I would classify the melody as slow and depressing (pessimistic), yet somehow it generates a feel-good response (optomistic).  Thus the question is posed.  The last line \"Oh all that I know...\" and the title \"Don't Panic\" suggest the answer is to view life with optomism.

Don't panic, acknowledges this but adds the positive \"but we live in a beautiful world\". The meaning is simple. The world can be a tough and terribly place sometimes, but in the end....it's beautiful. it's worth having--and life is worth living.

He just says this to show the person why 'there's nothing here to run from', then I think he concurrently hints that he himself is that 'somebody' that the person can lean on. But yeah, that's just my interpretation.\r\nBut all that being said, even though I've never contemplated suicide, this songs speaks to me on so many levels. Especially when I'm down, it just reminds me that I have awesome people around me that I can 'lean on'. And this is what makes Coldplay so bloody awesome! The fact that their songs can speak to so many people, even though those aren't necessarily the people who the song was mean for - that is if my interpretation was right, lol.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_156": "\nmeant*\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_157": "\nI found this song really ironic. I discovered this song today and I just learned that my first love just got deflowered by a guy I don't know anything about. The song says \"bones sinking like stone\" and \"places that we fought for\" and then \"all of us are done for\". For me it represents this big hole in our existence of \"why are we even here\" or \"why live and suffer so much\" then the chorus hops saying how beautiful the world is and how much it's worth to keep living on. At this point I don't know what to believe...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_158": "\nEven when the world comes crashing down around you, don't freak out because you've got friends in this great world.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_159": "\nI've only come across this song in the recent months (I was a Coldplay fan, but it started after Parachutes came out so I had to rediscover it).

It's funny and I quite adored Ford Prefect.\n\r\nGood song, by the way. I love that they do put references to the book, but they don't use a sarcastic, witty lyric (which is rather how the book is written).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_163": "\nmike27\n\r\nThis song possesess very influential but conscious material. The song focuses around the Rapture. and how everyday life and routines will someday come to a hult, and the world will come crashing down and those who believe they are annointed by their \"God\" will be saved. for example if you look at the end of the video the Band is on a raft and are soaring through the heavens (atmosphere) away from harm. and the line 'There's nothing here to run from' 'Cause, yeah everybody here's got someone to lean on'.i believe means that when the world ends (cataclysm begins) people should not reflect any fear but cherish the moments they have with those who are very important to them. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_164": "\nI found that it was about how short and meaningless life is when you base it on physical things (Such as short life expectancy).

Homes places we've grown all of us are done for\" sounds like everything we've worked so hard for in life, all of our possessions and our nostalgia and family and us and our bodies will all be gone and mean nothing when we die. Then \"we live in a beautiful world\" which brings this uplifting spirit to the song. Like appreciate this place because it's beautiful and here and ours. This song is depressing and happy all in one. The last article of the song goes \"there's nothing here to run from, because everyone here has got someone to lean on\" I heard a quote today that went something like \"the best things in life to experience are love and art\" which I think of when I hear this last passage of the song because it's so true. Everyone here's got someone to lean on as in love in some form or another from your parents to your friends to the greatest that is another soul to share your self physically and mentally (significant other) to sum that up, have no fear because you have love and on top of it this amazing piece of art. Good day right? \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_167": "\nI feel like this song is about depression.\n\n\"Bones, sinking like stones\" - like into the dumps of depression\n\"all that we've fought for/Homes, places we've grown/All of us are done for\" - despite all this work we've done in our lives, depression does us in, and makes it all seem worthless.\n\n\"We live in a beautiful world...\" - an attempt at reassurance, like you know this world is beautiful, and you're trying to see it. Only sometimes do you succeed.\n\n\"We've got nothing here to run from/'Cause here, everybody here's got somebody to lean on\" - Depression often leaves you with feelings of loneliness and, coupled with Anxiety, fear. The song leaves a nice reminder that there are people you can lean on.\n\nOverall, I think this song was written for someone going through a time of fear, loneliness, and/or apathy. \n\nIt would make sense for Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy to be the foundation of the lyrics/title, with the theme of depression. Great songwriting by Chris Martin on this one\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_168": "\nI think this song speaks of the suffering and pain involved in life. We live in a beautiful world as opposed to what a wonderful world. We live in a beautiful world but he does not say we are beautiful. \nI think\n\"Everybody here has got somebody to lean on,\" should be changed into, \"Some here have somebody or something to lean on.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_169": "\nThis cover will give you goosebumps!\n\r\nListen to Don't Panic by Clairity on Apple\u00c2\u00a0Music. itun.es/us/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_170": "\nthis song is great for when you're feeling depressed, I seriously just listen to the verse \"Oh all that I know There's nothing here to run from 'Cos yeah, everybody here's got somebody to lean on\" cuz if im sad it makes me realize the good things i have....this song is definitely one of my faves\n\n\n"}
