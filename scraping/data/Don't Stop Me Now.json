While this is not enough to properly create the summary that the song is based off of drugs, it contributes to the theme.\n     Now, if we go to the lyrical content, we see that the link between the song and drugs is pretty strong. The stanza that begins with, \"I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky/Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity...\" exemplifies the side effects that are common with the drug LSD in that strange hallucinations are being reported by whoever the song is about. Secondly, the mentioning of the drug speed is taken literally here, for Mercury sings the lines, \"I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva/I'm gonna go go go...\" He then goes into the chorus, which has lines, \"Two hundred degrees/That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit\" and, \"Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time/I'm having a ball...\" The first part of the chorus constitutes that the song's subject is \"baked\" -- a term suggesting that one under the influence of drugs is experiencing the consequences. The second part of the chorus, where he speaks of having a 'good time,' also contributes to the theme of the response to drugs. After the chorus, Mercury sings, \"Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars/On a collision course...\" which is a nod to marijuana because it make people \"high,\" like a rocket in space. As a mention to the final drug, ecstasy, the song has the lines, \"I am a sex machine ready to reload/Like an atom bomb about to/Oh oh oh oh oh explode...\" the link here is obvious.\nOverall, this song is, quite simply, about the cheerful first-person account of doing drugs.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis song makes me feel INVINCIBLE.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nHe's bi, who cares?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\ni love this song, i think its just about being young and having your life ahead of u but i dont know.\r\nsue\r\n-x-\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nThe song doesn't need any real explaining - it just rocks.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nDon't stop me now I'm having such a good time!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nNow this is my interpretation.

Back when it came out in 1978, topics like drugs and sex were still quite risky in rock music. If a musician blatantly sang about such topics, he/she would've garnered immediate controversy. Which Queen never did (outside of Freddie's non-musical life). Of course, today such topics are perfectly common and accepted in rock music. But back about 30 years ago, they weren't so much. So I honestly think all these interpretations about it being about \"drugs\" and \"gay sex\" (did Freddie even realize his homosexuality at the time? - I think around the time that song was written, he was actually in a relationship with some woman, whom he broke up with shortly after) are way off.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_21": "\nAbout sexual freedom.

But this song seems to be in between as it claims attributes of both discographies (the long guitar solo courtesy of the heavy metal genre and the piano to drum syncronization courtesy of the progressive rock genre) this song could've been the point where Queen's early progressive rock discography began to give way to their later heavy metal discography.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_27": "\nI think its just a fun song to listen to.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_28": "\nQuite simply the best sing-a-long song ever written.

The reference to ecstasy might be out of context, but everything else seems to fit.

About just wanting to have fun. It is a drug and AIDS free song. \n\r\nAnd IT HAS a strong reference to sex.

That said, AdamGullets comment is pure tripe. Older experienced genuine Queen fans from their first days will also have paid particular attention to Brian May and other members of the band and staff interviews. Freddy wrote this song at the height of hedonistic days, his discovery of the gay/bi clubs in NYC and in his own interviews he admits that during this time he was having the time of his life, with little regard as to potential future consequences (aids had NOT been named yet) and his intentions during this time of exploration, less stigma for gay/bi men in the places/clubs he had recently 'discovered'. He himself said he wanted to live his life then as fully, fast, dangerous, being loved by as many people as he could, sexual and otherwise. People seem to either deny/claim that most of Queens music was about sex/gay/bi/aids...and whilst some of it was, much of it was not. They ALL wrote for the band, had written FIVE songs for Highlander after being asked for just one. They also wrote the Flash Gordon soundtrack, and their epic Bohemian Rhapsody was an expiramental piece turned down by multiple promoters and labels, and when finally picked up on a punt, became one of their most acknowledged masterpieces in spite of it mostly being ambiguous in its lyrics.
