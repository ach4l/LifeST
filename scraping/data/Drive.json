{"comment_0": "\nThis is probably my favorite Halsey song, not just because of her bombastic voice or soundscape, but because the lyrics struck a chord with me. \nIn her relationship, all they do is drive and enjoy each other's company, even though they both know they have feelings for each other. They are both scared to make the first move, waiting for a sign. Perhaps they were both so distracted by their thoughts and feelings that they missed their sign/exit, and now they're stuck driving down that road again with no deviation from their path. \n\n\"It's so simple, but we can't stay\"\nIt's simple to say the words \"I love you\" to each other, but they both know it wouldn't work out. \n\n\"Over-analyze again\" \nOverthinking relationships (is this friendship? more? one-sided?) is easy, and it's easy to become impatient when one or both people are doing this. \n\n\"Would it really kill you if we kissed?\"\nImpatience and frustration is inevitable in a slow-burning relationship. Halsey is expressing a need for this person to just take a risk and make a move. It would make her vulnerable, but there's a chance it would resolve the tension and she could feel at home again.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nIn my opinion it sounds like she's talking about a sexual relationship.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI am going to have to agree with the first interpretation, however, I understand the second but I get the impression that the ah ah ahs they're singing is ah ah ah as in it's not right for them to have these feelings or potentially taboo. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
