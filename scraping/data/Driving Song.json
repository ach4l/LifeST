{"comment_0": "\nI love this song. I have felt the vibe this song gives off so many times in my life. Sitting by yourself, maybe with your dog, breathing the crisp air, smoking a bowl and thinking about going somewhere else. It's about the moment you realize that you've settled into your current life a little bit too much and need to shake things up and get in the car and just drive.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nthis song is straight up bad ass. it just makes you think of fall. widespread paints audio pictures. if i hear this song driving down the road in the fall i just feel really good\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis songs basic melody bears an uncanny resmeblance to Status Quo's \"Matchstick men\",\n\r\nThe Screaming Tree's \"All I Know\"\n\r\nand Lenny Kravitz' \"Fly Away\"\n\n\n\r\nIt's a very resilient riff, any other arrangement I would have started hating because I've heard it so many times,...\n\r\nI'm just curious as to the repeated borrowing of the melody through out the years,\n\r\nWhy has it been used so many times in original material?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis is probably my favorite song although i really am not a big fan of widespread panic.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
