{"comment_0": "\nI think this song is simple.\n\r\nTwo lonely people--Eleanor Rigby and Father McKenzie--are the subjects.\n\r\nEleanor Rigby lives in a pretend world that she made for herself because she is so lonely and unknown--she goes into a church building after a stranger's wedding is over and grabs the rice to throw, pretending she's getting married. When she goes home, she sits by the window and smiles out, either hoping to grab someone's attention or pretending she has (\"Who is it for?\").\n\r\nFather McKenzie is a preacher that is probably used primarily for wedding services and his actual preaching isn't really well-attended. He spends all night fixing up his clothes to look good for a sermon no one will go to (\"What does he care?\").\n\r\nIn the finale, Eleanor has finally died, leaving nothing but her name (which is on the tombstone), and McKenzie was the one who buried her (because a burial is done with hands and a shovel, he got dirt on them and wipes it off). Because nobody came to her funeral, no one was \"saved\" by the sermon he had planned for her.\n\n\r\nThat's the story--as to its meaning, it may simply be a lament for all the people in the world that have no one.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\ni work at this place where i call people up and survey them, and this old lady that was willing to take it, and in the middle of the survey we just started talking, and she was talking about how her husband died, and she just started crying, and i thought... i wonder if i'm the only one she has talked to in a while.. and it made me sad that i can't help all the lonely people.. and this song reminds me of that\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThough it is one of my favorite songs I always feel a bit uncomfortable hearing it. \r\nIt always seemed to me as if the lines \"All the lonely people, where do they all come from? All the lonely people, where do they all belong?\" implicate on the listeners and accuse them of being a part of a cold and inhumane society.\n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI've had an inspiration about the meaning of this song and joined specifically so I could share my inspiration. I have not read all the comments because there are a lot but I read most of them and none of you got this. A few hinted at it but none of you got this.\n\r\nI'm going to come right out and say that this song was directed at the church. This song was directed at Christianity in general. Singing about Father McKenzie was not singing about a random individual who happened to be a church leader. For the purpose of this song, Father McKenzie =IS= the representation of Christianity. \"Ah, look at all the lonely people\" and \"No one was saved\".\n\r\nYes, there is a hint of a connection between Father McKenzie and Eleanor Rigby. But the song is not saying that they did anything together. The two might never have even spoken outside of the usual church banter. What the song is suggesting is that there should have been more of a connection between Father McKenzie and Eleanor Rigby. But \"No one was saved\" because Father McKenzie was too busy being self-righteous, too busy \"writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear.\" This song is a bold-faced accusation against the self-righteous and overly religious that refuse to reach out to the all the lonely people and then wonder why so few come to church.\n\r\nThis song is saying that it isn't enough to be friendly. This song is saying that as long as people, especially religious people, remain cold and aloof, the Eleanor Rigby's of this world will continue to die and be \"buried along with her name\". A person's name is very important in Judeo-Christian values.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis sounds crazy, but I'm a great fan of Dickens, and whenever I hear this song, I think of Miss Havisham. Especially at the beginning part of it. To all who are unaquainted with Miss Havisham, she is a character in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations (a very good novel, by the way.) She was jilted on her wedding day as a young girl, and her heart was broken. She stopped all of the clocks in her house at the time she was jilted, shut up all the windows, and left everything just as it was. As an old lady, she sits in her wedding dress and veil, the wedding feast still sitting out, rotten, in the dining room, and meanwhile exacts her revenge on men with her beautiful, unattainable adopted daughter, Estella. Eleanor Rigby's lonliness and her constant sort of waiting state always bring Miss Havisham to mind. So there! By reading this post you got one bibliophile's strange opinion and a literature lesson all in one!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI think Father McKenzie and Eleanor were meant to be together but never were. Two lonely people who could have been together. She was frequenting the church where he worked and he was the only one who attended her funeral. He came as a friend because he picked up dirt to throw over her. It's sad because if you are a lonely person, you never know how close you may be to someone else who is lonely.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nThis is obviously a song about lonely people. It seems that Eleanor Rigby was a lonely single person, she often went to Church, perhaps to ease the emptiness that she felt inside, maybe she even hoped to make friends there. Whilst in Church perhaps she saw the rice left over from other peoples' weddings, and often regretted that she had never had the chance to get married or have a family. \n\n\"Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door\", suggests that like most lonely people, she hid her unhappiness whenever she left the house and tried to appear happy like everybody else. \"Window\" and \"Jar\" suggests that her outward attempts to hide her unhappiness didn't work very well and was easy to see through, as both windows and jars are glass.\n\n\"Died in the church\" perhaps relates to the last place she visited before she passed away, perhaps she was even found dead inside the church, either from natural causes or maybe even suicide.\n\n\"Buried along with her name\" seems to indicate that she was the last of her family, having no relatives, siblings or children of her own to continue the family bloodline, maybe she was the last remaining \"Rigby\" from her family circle and nobody left to carry the surname on.\n\nIn the UK it is a tradition that when people are buried for the closest relative(s) to throw a handful of dirt into the grave before it is filled in. Because Eleanor had no relatives or friends at her graveside, Father Mackenzie felt sorry for her, and decided to do it, hence \"Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave\"\n\n\"No one was saved\" perhaps sums up how Father Mackenzie feels, nobody comes to his Church, all he does is bury people and he has had no opportunity to help anybody with their problems or feel like he has played a part in bettering somebody else's life. Perhaps Eleanor was so lonely that she committed suicide in the Church which would also be an alternative to \"Died in the Church\", and also why Father Mackenzie feels guilty at not being in the Church to talk to her and try to stop her from killing herself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nI really love this song and being a philosophy minor makes me love it even more.  I think the Beatles are pointing out where all this unhappiness comes from.  First off, E.R is most likely a nun or janitor (picking up rice) who wants to get closer to F.M, but because of Catholicism they can't be together (implementing religion for unhappiness).  Also, the next part about wearing a face in a jar by the door is referring to makeup worn to give the illusion of happiness or just putting on a front whenever in public to try to be happy like everyone else, but it turns out there are truly many unhappy people (so society as well).  The next part about writing words that no one will hear, has to do with F.M who is trying to help others but he can't even help himself because of a religion that is supposed to make life better, but is doing the opposite \"No-one comes near\" and \" a sermon no one will hear.\"  However, in spite of this he still blindly works hard at something that is a lost cause, \"darning his socks.\"  He is trying, but not really thinking because if he was than he would realize how unhappy he is and change his path in life. The last part about E.R dying gives a truthful yet sad example of what the outcome and future holds; E.R never married \"buried along with her name\" and I might be reading into it too much, but \"she,\" not in a physical sense, but in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cself\u00e2\u0080\u009d sense died before her body did as a result of the church.  Also the last lines about F.M \"wiping the dirt from his hands\" is almost like he is once again not reflecting on what has happened and blindly following something that has led to such anguish.  I think this song says a lot about the Beatles views on religion and we can't really dispute all of this...............\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nI remember walking through the halls of my Juinor High school, years back, with hundreds of people bumping and pushing, and thinking: \"i wonder how many times i've seen these same people, and yet i've still never seen them before, i'm seeing them for the first time.\"\n\r\nThat's what this is about. Walking down the halls, you see all kinds of people, and everyone is there with a purpose. But you, just walking to class, are the lonliest, like a fish bowl, you are only a spektator. \n\r\nI think the lines \"Father McKenzie, writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear\" and \"[Eleanor Rigby] waits at the window, wearing a face she keeps in a jar by the door\" are the most meaning full. The first one is like all the things you hear, and see, and that maybe someone has spent time working on, and you will never really see it, or remember it. The second one is like when you have a job where 'the costomer is always right,' and you always have to smile even though you don't have a need to, or you don't want to. It's pretty depressing trying to live life impressing others. I get this image of someone sitting in a run down, dark room looking out a window, which is a rather depressing scene, and the door bell rings. So she gets up and greets her guests with a surprised greeting and a smile. But then she goes back to sitting in her chair, looking out her gloomy window. \n\n\n", "comment_9": "\nit was not written after they was a tombstone with her name on it... actually, technically, that's not true, but the tombstone was not the inspiration.  most fanatics agree that this is largely a paul song, though paul's and john's stories differ about who wrote most of the song.  paul remembers taking the name eleanor from an actress he worked with (on Help!, I believe).  and, mckenzie was an alteration of the original name \"Father McCartney.\"  however, it was pointed out to paul years later that in a cemetery where he and john used to get drunk there is both a Rigby tombstone (not Eleanor Rigby's, but it does mention an Eleanor Rigby on it, I believe) and a McKenzie tombstone (John McKenzie if I'm not mistaken).  so, it is possible that the names may have caught paul's fancy by way of subconscious recollection from his youth.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nI think that this song can be interpreted many ways, but I'll just comment on, what I consider to be, the two most obvious interpretations. The first is based on the more superficial and tangible. The song begins and ends talking about lonely people, and asks the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere do they all belong\u00e2\u0080\u009d? The answer is obvious, with each other. If they were with each other they wouldn't be lonely. We all live in our own worlds. That's why Eleanor has a (public) face that she keeps in a jar by the door. We don't let others know the Real us. Why won't anyone hear the priest's sermon? It doesn't say nobody will be there, it says, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca sermon no one will hear\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The congregation will be there, they just won't hear, or understand the sermon. We tend to talk \u00e2\u0080\u009cat\u00e2\u0080\u009d each other, especially when given titles denoting authority or alleging expertise. We all live in our own world, by ourselves and that is why we are lonely.\n\nInterpretation #2. There is no God. Lonely = alone with no invisible friends. Notice how the whole song revolves around religion. Eleanor (old church lady) is waiting for someone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwaits at the window\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this God that she has focused her whole life on.  But why are we so lonely? If we truly believe in all the stories of our wonderful invisible friend who loves and cares for us so much, and is always with us, then why are we so lonely? (because it is a lie and that is what the rest of the song is about) Pay close attention to the words  No One and NoBody and how they are used. The reason \u00e2\u0080\u009cno one will hear\u00e2\u0080\u009d the sermon (and not nobody, denoting physical people with bodies) is because there is no God, no spirit or ghost listening.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cEleanor Rigby died in the church\u00e2\u0080\u009d also speaks to the way the church holds us back from our potential (guilt, original sin, comparing yourself to a perfect being, constantly worshiping authority  figure) and kills our individuality (\u00e2\u0080\u009cburied along with her name\u00e2\u0080\u009d). No people seemed to show up to this lonely person's funeral, except for Father McKenzie. It specifically states that no one  (not a body but an entity, a ghost or spirit) was saved. If you surrender yourself to your religion's tenets, shouldn't you receive salvation? And yet, for this religious person, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo One was saved\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Well, there's a whole lifetime thrown down the toilet, which is the point of the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\ni think this song is about, you know how you walk down the street and see thousands of faces that you don't know or recognize and don't even think twice about?  well i think this song is about how there are these people (eleanor rigby and father mckenzie) and these sad things happen to them and no one knows them or cares so they don't really matter to anyone.  it's sad that people walk through life not really caring about others.  they get too involved in what's happening in their lives with work and whatnot and they forget that there are other people out their dealing with problems every day.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nI don't think there's any deep hidden meaning here - I doubt Father McKenzie murdered Eleanor Rigby or had an affair with her.

I think in a way the Beatles are saying here that we must ALL work harder to love and connect with one another, and help prevent loneliness, and that it should not be that hard... maybe with someone right next door or right down the street even. (Like Rigby and McKenzie....) Or perhaps I'm reading too much into the song. ;-) heheh.

It's like we feel so sorry for Eleanor Rigby, but it seems nobody really cared for her.  She dreamed of happiness and marriage, but in the end, just died - lonely and unmarried.  We live, we die, nobody really cares.  The Priest obviously didn't help anyone either, he just went on living his useless life folding his socks, as if that makes him a good person.\n\r\nHow sad this is.

Who just recently lost her husband. \n\r\n\"Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been, Lives in a dream.\"\r\nThis is her rememnering her own wedding day. She picks it up to look at it and it make her daydream about her marrige to her late husband.\n\r\n\"Waits at the window, wearing a face she keeps in a jar by the door, Who is it for?\"\r\nSince the loss is so fresh, so sometimes feel like her husband should be walking through the door any minute, so she patiently waits her him there by the window. Look out for him.  The \"face\" she's wearing is a face of smiles and happiness that she plans to great him with. But who is it for? She knows he's not coming back.\n\r\nAs for F.M.

That F.M And E.R are just two people who's have one common theme: They're lonely. \n\r\n\"Father McKenzie, writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear, No-one comes near\"\r\nIn F.M's eyes. It seems people have lost faith in the church. They either don't come or don't really listen to the words that he preached which makes him feel like a man alone with his religion.\n\r\n\"Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nobody there, What does he care?\"\r\nSimply no body's there to care what he's doing. He might as well got some mending done.\n\r\n\"Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name. Nobody came.\"\r\nE.R is now dead and took her (and her husbands) name with her. And since her husband was all she had, one one was there to mourn at her funeral. \n\r\n\"Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave. No-one was saved.\"\r\nFron what I picture it, he was doing his typical father-type thing \"ashes to ashes. dust to dust\" (which might have picked up some other the dirt to do). After he's one with his jsut he walks away feeling hollow. He job is now just a routine that goes unnoticed and his words have no one and it's something he thinks about  while he wipes away the dirt.\n\n\n\r\nI, in no way, say that that's exactly what the songs meaning is.

For example, one could argue that until one sees this post on this site, it would not exist.  Or, one could say there is no war because they have not seen it.  I don't personally believe this philosophy (at least not to the extreme of my second example), but I think something like that is being conveyed in Eleanor Rigby.  It's evidenced in any lines that denote nonchalance (i.e. \"Nobody came\" \"No-one was saved\" \"What does he care?\")  It's like Eleanor Rigby hasn't been seen, and therefore doesn't exist, which is why no one came to her funeral.  And Father McKenzie has never been seen or heard, so his sermons don't matter to anyone.  I must say, I love the line \"Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door\", because I can just imagine how that face must look, even though I couldn't describe it to save my soul.  The line also goes back to what I said before--if Eleanor Rigby keeps her face in a jar by the door, it can't be seen by anyone (Except while she's waiting at the window... but who would see her there?)

Like, you can walk through the streets of new york city and just be surrounded with people, many of whom are lonely. It's ironic. You can have everyone in the world in one room and still be lonely. I'm sure that's not the meaning of this song, but I just wanted to point that out. I really do love this song, though. It is so sad, and it's interesting as well that there are two main characters in a song about being lonely. Also, when I first heard this song and for a long time afterwards, I thought it said \"Father McKenzie wiping the death from his hands.\" (not dirt) which i know now not to be the lyrics, but it gave me a slightly different look at it, which I believe is meant to be part of the song, I just wouldn't have noticed it so much without misunderstanding that word: that the death of this lonely person, a tragic song, a tragic story, can be just wiped away, and the priest who buries her feels nothing but the constant numb of loneliness. He doesn't bury her with sympathy or loss, but with the sense that it is just another task, another day, and this ending to Eleanor Rigby seems to give her life no meaning at all.

Does she not realize she's lonely?\r\n-\"Waits at the window...\"  What is she waiting for?  It doesn't say \"sitting at the window\", it says \"waits\"... Maybe she is waiting for a visitor?  Someone to rid her of her loneliness?  She is wearing her public face, waiting for someone, hoping someone will come.\r\n-\"Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear\". FORESHADOWING... key word is \"will\".  Eleanor will not hear the next sermon, because she will die before it.\r\n-\"No-one comes near\"  It sounds as if he is purposely being avoided by the rest of the world.  Eleanor does not come near because she is waiting at the window.  Makes me think of a nun and a priest, because they have their separate living quarters.\r\n-\"Darning\" means to mend, or to sew.  Why does it matter that no-one is there while he is sewing?\r\n-\"Buried along with her name\" makes me think that she had no influence on anything, as if she never existed (ironic that there is a song about her)... Her name will not be spoken again, because Father McKenzie has no-one to talk to.  If no-one comes near Father McKenzie, then Eleanor's memory will be buried with Father McKenzie.\r\n-\"Wiping the dirt from his hands\" just shows that he was the only one there.  He had to dig the grave and do the funeral.\r\n-\"No-one was saved\".  Is it the Christian meaning of saved?  Saved from loneliness possibly?  Because Father McKenzie is the only one left, maybe he is thinking that no-one was saved from death?\n\r\nNotice the contrast between the first verse, with Eleanor hoping and living in a dream; and the second verse, which uses the words \"no-one\" or \"nobody\" in every line, followed by \"What does he care?\".  Eleanor's verse isn't very negative, it's just strange.  Father McKenzie's verse is very very negative.

I think that many of you are overanalyzing the song and trying to find complex meanings.  Overall, the song is actually very straightforward.  It doesn't seem that way because many meanings are implied, and not directly presented to the listener.  THIS is what makes it such an incredible song.\n\r\nHere's my complete analysis for you:\n\n\n\r\n\"Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been,\r\nLives in a dream.\"\n\n\r\n[** OK, so here's the first bit of information we have on Eleanor.  Right away, we are viewing a depressing image: a lonely woman who desires companionship is picking up the rice on the ground, after a wedding has just finished.  Note how McCartney wrote that line: he doesn't say that she \"sweeps up the rice\".  She \"PICKS up the rice\", making it seem as though she is doing it piece by piece.  This would certainly indicate that she has A LOT of time on her hands.  I disagree with those who think she works at the church as a janitor or something.  The whole reason why she came to the church was because she \"lives in a dream\" that one day, she will be married or have some meaningful relationship.**]\n\n\r\n\"Waits at the window,\r\nWearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door.\r\nWho is it for?\"\n\n\r\n[** I've heard different theories as to exactly what the \"face that she keeps in a jar\" represents.  Many people believe that Eleanor Rigby puts on makeup so that she can look her best, holding on to the hope that someone, anyone, will greet her.  This is a good observation, but I don't think that's what the line is implying.  Figuratively, the \"face that she keeps in a jar by the door\" could represent a sort of false-happiness that she only \"wears\" when a visitor has approached her door.  She keeps it \"in a jar\" because it is only a mask to hide her loneliness and depression.  The question is asked, \"Who is it for?\"  Nobody can answer this question, not even Eleanor herself.  She is still holding on to the hopeless dream that she will find love and/or companionship.**]\n\n\r\n\"All the lonely people, where do they all come from?\r\nAll the lonely people, where do they all belong?\"\n\n\r\n[** This part of the song speaks about loneliness in general.  It basically asks the question, \"Why are so many people lonely when there are so many of them?\"**]\n\n\r\n\"Father McKenzie,\r\nWriting the words of a sermon that no-one will hear,\r\nNo-one comes near.\"\n\n\r\n[** We are now introduced to another character in the story, Father McKenzie.  I do NOT believe that Eleanor Rigby and Father McKenzie knew each other at all.  Nowhere in this song is that theory even hinted at.  They were just two terribly lonely people, who both wanted to be involved in a relationship of some kind.\n\r\n** Note how many direct references there are to loneliness in this part of the song.  \"Writing the words of a sermon that NO ONE will hear.\"  This is a figurative line, to illustrate McKenzie's loneliness.  I'm sure he has church members who WILL hear his sermon, but none of them can fill the void that is in him, so it doesn't even matter.  The line, \"No one comes near\" is an example of how, even though McKenzie interacts with people at church, he manages to stay lonely because he has no relationship with them.  It's as if they don't exist.  This is where Eleanor Rigby and Father McKenzie are the most similar: both of them are WAITING for a relationship to happen instead of trying to find one.  Eleanor \"waits at the window\" and McKenzie is upset because \"no one comes near\".  Each character's passive attitude clearly has A LOT to do with their own descent into loneliness and depression.**]\n\n\r\n\"Look at him working,\r\nDarning his socks in the night when there's nobody there.\r\nWhat does he care?\"\n\n\r\n[** This part of the song can easily be compared to the line in the previous Eleanor verse, when Eleanor is \"wearing the face that she keeps in a jar\".  (In fact, the music is identical for both lines.)  The difference is that Father McKenzie seems to be \"darning his socks\" to take his mind off his own problems, and not necessarily to impress anyone.  To add to the overall melancholy feel, he's doing something that most people would find terribly boring.  Like Eleanor, he seems to have a lot of time on his hands.  \"What does he care?\"  Why should he care about his socks when he is filled with so much sadness?  It's almost as if he's going through a stage of self-pity, and he's completely given up.  It could also be compared to the first verse, when Eleanor \"picks up the rice\".**]\n\n\r\n\"Eleanor Rigby,\r\nDied in the church and was buried along with her name.\r\nNobody came.\"\n\n\r\n[** Now we come upon something interesting.  This verse clearly states that Eleanor \"dies in the church\".  Perhaps this is only mentioned to further connect the two characters, or perhaps there is a greater meaning.  It is quite possible that it was used as irony.  Eleanor wants to be married, and she dies in the very place where she would have been happiest.  According to the verse, she was also \"buried along with her name\".  This may give the listener an idea of a tombstone marking where she is buried, but it actually symbolizes how, when she died, the memory of her died also.  \"Nobody came\" to the funeral, because nobody knew her.  She would easily be forgotten.**]\n\n\r\n\"Father McKenzie,\r\nWiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave.\r\nNo-one was saved.\"\n\n\r\n[** I'd like to interrupt my analysis to tell you this: I've just now realized that this song could take on a completely different meaning.  I don't know which to believe, but both are fascinating.  Here's my other theory:\n\r\nLet's start by analyzing this verse.  Father McKenzie is \"wiping the dirt from his hands\" almost as if he's actually accomplished something.  This is followed by the line, \"no-one was saved\".  At first, I thought nothing of it, but then I started to look at the complete lyrics.  I realized just how many times the narrator FIRMLY DENIES something.  \"...A sermon that NO-ONE will hear,\" \"NO-ONE comes near,\" \"...when there's NOBODY there,\" \"NOBODY came,\" \"NO-ONE was saved\".  Suddenly, it hit me, that Father McKenzie is a priest, and is traditionally not supposed to have a serious relationship with a woman.  Is it possible that the overuse of the words \"nobody\" and \"no-one\" are sarcasm, and that the narrator is trying to cover up something that DID occur between these two characters?  What if you saw the lyrics this way:\n\r\n\"Father McKenzie,\r\nWriting the words of a sermon that [Eleanor] will hear.\r\n[Eleanor] comes near.\n\r\nLook at him working,\r\nDarning his socks in the night when there's [Eleanor] there.\r\nWhat does he care?\n\r\nFather McKenzie,\r\nWiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave,\r\n[Eleanor] was saved.\"\n\n\r\nPerhaps I am overanalyzing everything, but if the song did take on this different meaning, the whole message of the song would change.  Eleanor would be \"saved,\" in the Christian sense, and go to heaven.  This would also explain why she \"died in a church\".\n\n\r\nThe first theory is certainly more logical, but the second one is also an interesting possibility.  Perhaps you should form your own opinion.  There is definitely more to this song than meets the eye (or rather, the ear).\n\n\r\n--Matt K.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_70": "\nThis is an incredible song.

What ever that name  is(reputation, literal name); We all die alone. FM wiping his hands could be absolving himself from the responsibility of no one being saved(much like Pilate regarding Jesus). As a priest, he is charged with the care and spiritual nurturing of his parishiner's salvation. Certainly during this period of the Catholic church's history, there was failure in this area.

How many weddings did she sweep up after during her service at the church? Probably years of weddings. But no wedding was ever for her. How can a single woman clean up after a wedding, and now think about how she does not have a man in her life. Father MacKenzie, he's darning his socks alone in the night. Darning socks is a woman's job. He must have thought how there was no woman in his life. Eleanor put on a smile when people came over, but it was a mask: she was lonely inside. Father Mackenzie would preach, also a show of interaction, but limited. No friends. They did their jobs and put on a good face, and lived their lonely lives so close to each other, but never connecting. I think he \"wiped the dirt from his hands\" because he officiated. She lived and died a lonely life, and now that she is gone, Father Mackenzie will remain lonely for the rest of his life too.

In some songs (like Pink Floyd's Empty Spaces), they are inserted intentionally, but not here.  You can usually tell an intentional backwards message because it is gibberish forwards.\n\r\nFor example, if I were to say, \"Hello, my name is frog,\" it would be, \"gorf si mane I'm olle.\"  This might be interpreted as gibberish followed by, \"see man, I'm old,\" though in reality it is nonsense.  This song is the same.\n\r\nThe reason for this is simple.  There have been studies (my mom is a psychologist, and these are psychological studies, so I would know) that show that the human mind, when hearing sounds, automatically looks for meaning among them.  Therefore, if gibberish sounds remotely like speech, and is associated in some way with something we know produces meaningful speech (a mouth, a song, etc...), our minds may twist it slightly into something we recognize.\n\r\nAnother example would be:\n\r\n\"Upstyle floor,\" which is, \"Rolf lights up,\" when said backwards.  You can't see this just  by reading lyrics (usually, however, I did both of the examples in that way, and by sounding them out), you normally have to hear it, and see/know something that associates it with logical speech.\n\r\nHope this helps.\n\r\nI think the song is about an affair between a priest and a woman (married probably), that leads to the woman's death and the cover-up by the priest, as well as the priest's neglecting of his duties, which include making \"all the lonely people\" feel like they are wanted and like they belong.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_194": "\nthis is one of my fave beatles songs.. i think that ER and FM had a little affair.. but he didnt want anyone to know about it.. seeing as though hes a father. i dont think he actually killed her... the dust off the hands could be because he was so sad w/ what happened? clutching her grave... you know...  but thats just what i think.. the beatles made songs for people to make their own meanings up.. thats the best part of being a performer... the listener becomes the real musician..\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_195": "\nI always thought the line...\n\r\n\"wearing a face she keeps in a jar by the door\"\n\r\nimplied she wore false teeth.

Someone mentioned she cleans up after weddings. Makes sense to me. She's lonely. The other character in the song is Father McKenzie. They have to be connected somehow. It could be that she wants to be with him.\n\r\nBut if it's true that he's a priest, aren't priests prohibited from getting married? He's unattainable. She's lonely. She knows there's no chance, and she can't let anyone see it gets to her. So before leaving her room, she \"puts on her face\" that makes her look less empty. OR the \"face in a jar\" could be makeup. She puts makeup on, but why? Who's it for? Father McKenzie, perhaps? Even though they could never be, she can still look nice for him. \n\r\n\"Father McKenzie, writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear,\r\nNo-one comes near\r\nLook at him working, darning his socks in the night when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nobody there,\r\nWhat does he care?\"\n\r\nNot sure how the sermon could come into this version of the meaning. Possibly just showing how lonely he is. He feels like no one pays attention to him, but he writes his sermon anyway - it's his duty. He could be darning his socks in the night for the next day. It's like cleaning house; you don't do it when people are watching. What does he care? Maybe he wants to look nice? Maybe for Eleanor? Maybe just because he's a priest?\n\r\n\"Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name.\r\nNobody came.\r\nFather McKenzie, wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave.\r\nNo-one was saved.\"\n\r\nWhen Eleanor died, she was buried with HER name. She was never married. Almost like she was obsessed with the idea of being with Father McKenzie. And he didn't kill her. In Catholic burials, it's a tradition to throw dirt on the casket before burying. The priest conducting the funeral does that. That's why he wipes his hands.\n\r\nNo one was saved? From what? Could it be in the religious sense, seeing that he is a priest? Or could it be from loneliness? Neither of them ever got what they wanted. They will both die alone.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:\n\r\nOn the Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) All the people are looking at a freshly dug grave.\n\r\n2.) Paul is holding the musical instrument cor anglais, and it is black, symbolizing death, and the only Beatle holding a black instrument. Where Paul is holding it with his left hand (being left-handed) he is displaying three fingers, meaning only three Beatles left?\n\r\n3.) This was the first album on Apple Records and the first album that the group wrote their name as \"Beatles,\" rather than \"The Beatles.\" This is inferred to mean that they are no longer a whole as in \"The,\" but now since there are only three, it is just \"Beatles.\"\n\r\n4.) The yellow hyacinth in the shape of a left-handed guitar only has three strings.\n\r\n5.) The doll in the red, black and white stripes has a car model on her lap next to her right hand. This model with red interior is supposed to mean the car in which Paul was killed and the red interior is blood.\n\r\n6.) The other three Beatles' are standing sideways behind the drum, except Paul who is standing forward.\n\r\n7.) On the drum is written in the center \"Lonely Hearts.\" Using a mirror, place it perpendicular to the center of the drum. Splitting the words \"Lonely Hearts\" in half, the combined writing reads - 1 ONE 1 X HE DIE. This means that the \"1 One 1\" equal three, or that Paul is gone, and the \"X\" is meant to cross out Paul. Between the words \"HE\" and \"DIE\" is an arrow that points directly to Paul.\n\r\n8.) The hand raised over Paul's head, is to mean \"death.\"\n\r\nThe Back Cover:\n\r\n1.) Paul is facing the back, which can mean that he is an imposter, or that he is dead.\n\r\n2.) George's right-hand index finger is pointing directly to the words \"five o'clock,\" the supposed time of the car crash.\n\r\n3.) That the song lyrics \"Within You, Without You,\" are printed over Paul's body.\n\r\nThe Songs:\n\r\n1.) Lovely Rita:\"When I caught a glimpse of Rita,\" and \"I took her home, I nearly made it.\"\n\r\n2.) A Day In The Life: \" He blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had changed. A crowd of people stood and stared, they'd seen his face before...\" \n\r\n3.) Good Morning, Good Morning: \"Nothing to do to save his life.\" \"People running around it's five o'clock.\" \n\r\n4.) She's Leaving Home: \"Wednesday morning at five o'clock.\"\n\r\n5.) Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: The reference to Billy Shears is supposed to be that of William (Billy) Campbell, the look-alike.\n\r\nMagical Mystery Tour\n\r\nThe Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) Paul is alleged to be the one in the \"black\" walrus suit.\n\r\n2.) In the booklet, Ringo's drums read \"Love the 3 Beatles.\"\n\r\n3.) In the picture where The Beatles' are wearing white tails, Paul is the only one with a black carnation, the other three have red. \n\r\n4.) When you hold the album cover to a mirror, the word \"Beatles\" is a phone number, which is 2317438. It has been said that if you had called this number back then, a recording came on saying, \"you're getting closer.\" Of course there is no area code etc., so I doubt this one too.\n\r\nThe Songs:\n\r\n1.) I Am The Walrus: At the end of the song, where the spoken words from the play King Lear are placed, you here \"O, untimely death!\" and of course as we know, \"The Walrus Was Paul.\"\n\r\n2.) Strawberry Fields Forever: When John Lennon says in the end of the song the words \"Cranberry Sauce,\" it was long believed to be he saying \"I Buried Paul.\" However, it was electronically manipulated to sound like he was saying \"I Buried Paul\" but he actually isn't. 3.) All You Need Is Love: At the end, Lennon says, \"Yes, he's dead.\"\n\r\nYellow Submarine\n\r\nThe Front and Back Covers\n\r\n1.) Lennon's hand raised over Paul's head, indicating \"death.\"\n\r\nThe Beatles (The White Album)\n\r\n1.) Glass Onion: The term used for a coffin with a glass top.\n\r\n2.) 'Don't Pass Me By: \"You were in a car crash....\"\n\r\n3.) Revolution 9: The words, \"Number nine, number nine,\" repeated many times are supposed to say when played backwards, \"dead man, turn me on dead man.\" The reference to the number 9 is supposed to be that of McCartney having nine letters.\n\r\nAbbey Road\n\r\nThe Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) The common meaning of the Beatles' dress - Lennon in white for a priest, Ringo as the undertaker, George as the grave digger, and of course Paul, in his bare feet, holding a cigarette in his right hand (being lefty) all means death.\n\r\n2,) The police vehicle parked to the right in the photograph is a morgue wagon. \n\r\n3.) The Volkswagen parked on the left side of the street has a tag that reads, \"LMW 28IF.

This is a common symptom of Stockholm Syndrome, where victims of crimes (most notably rape and kidnapping victims) sometimes develop a loyalty to their assailants. Father McKenzie writes sermons even though he knows no one will come near him or his church. That makes me think the people who used to attend his services no longer feel safe. Eleanor later died, in my opinion a suicide after finally realizing he doesn't love her and the possibility that she became a social pariah afterward. Father McKenzie then had to bury her as part of his priestly duties.

Rigby, who is still waiting in the church, is oblivious to this as she is trailing more away from reality and into her fantasies of leaving loneliness for good. \nRigby is then killed by Mckenzie and is buried at the back of the church and is buried. Mckenzie incites his written sermon of delirium and 'wipes the dirt off his hands': forgets Eleanor Rigby for good.\nI'm not saying this theory is 100% accurate, but it's interesting how I came this up in just minutes.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
