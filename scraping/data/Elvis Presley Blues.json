{"comment_0": "\nI believe the lyric should be \"like you never seen\", not \"like he never seen\". The idea is that the people who watched Elvis on TV in those early days were shocked by his gyrations.  They called him \"Elvis the pelvis\".  Elvis might have gotten some of his dance moves from watching black R&B artists perform.  Elvis had seen it all. So, it's not \"like he never seen\".  It's \"like you never seen\".\n\r\nIt's \"he was all alone in a long decline\", not \"he was all alone in a long dead climb\".  Elvis was fat, isolated and addicted to all kinds of drugs.  He was in a long decline.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nthanks jweyek for that correction on \u00e2\u0080\u009edecline\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Imo that is key to the song. As contrasted to John Henry who died in his finest moment, Elvis had a long and lonely decline to his death. That is sad.\nand thanks FishesWillLaugh, I agree - Gillian must really admire and understand the phenomenon that Elvis was. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, but hearing the song and reading your explanations I am getting the feel for it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
