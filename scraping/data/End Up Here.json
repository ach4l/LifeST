{"comment_0": "\nHonest to god, this was my first favourite 5sos song ever. This song I believe is about how an 'average' looking guy is at a party and a girl who he thinks is way out of his league walks in. When she comes his way, she compliments his shirt Kurt Cobain Shirt. This strikes a conversation between them and they \"spend the night together. He compares this time with you to the song by Bon Jovi Living on a prayer and that it was surreal. The next day the girl does not leave him, and his friend say he should lock her down but she doesn't leave. He starts to question how this could even happen. Basically he feels so lucky to be with this girl.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
