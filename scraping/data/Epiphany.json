{"comment_0": "\nI just love the second part of this song (starting from \"Did you ever walk up to the edge of a cliff\"); it's such a beautiful allegory for taking risks and having to decide between what may seem the logical solution and what you feel is the solution YOU NEED. If you take that final step you either win everything or lose it all - it depends on your luck. \n\r\nAnd also, I see TSO came back to a theme they sang about in \"What Is Eternal\": which actions/thoughts/images decide the nature of a person, in the end? \"From Eternity's view\", is he the man he used to be, or the reformed version of himself? Which one really matters?\n\r\nTheir songs might have a bit too much pathos; (or sometimes sound downright cheesy); but damn, I love them anyway!  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
