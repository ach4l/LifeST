{"comment_0": "\nIf you have an anti-Christian bias, then this song will be about Jesus to you. However, \"get off your fuckin cross\" refers to anyone who is playing the part of the martyr for the attention, of which there have been hundreds since Christ. Also, Christ was not surprised to hear his own eulogy, he prophesied it and talked about it frequently, and even stated it was his purpose to die. So, I don't think it's about Jesus. One thing I love about Tool is their songs make people think.. well some of them anyways... if all you can do is bash Christians that doesn't take a lot of brainpower, just repeat what you hear in the media. However, for those of us who have a truly open mind rather than an empty mind filled with nonsense... just hit play.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song isn't about religion.  It uses religion as a metaphor to get the information across.  This song refers to someone who thinks they are better than everyone else.  It emphasizes the trust that people take in others or the lack of it.  Tool is not a religous band.  By this I mean they don't promote their beliefs to try and persuade others to think the same.  They want everyone to be their own person and not conform to the \"usual\" because that's the way it was done in the past.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThe idea of the martyr is metaphorical. The tone is sarcastic, and at the same time grudgingly true. If you read carefully, no one dies. The miss him is that the recipient of the \"Eulogy\" has stepped down from his cross or pulpit.\n\n\r\nHe had a lot of nothing to say\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nWe're gonna miss him\r\nWe're gonna miss him>\n\r\nThe set up. A person who talks a lot, but what he talks about has now import or merit (\"a lot of nothing to say\"). Followed up with the refrain \"We'll miss him\"... he isn't here anymore, and the sarcasm is immediate, since the line \"We'll miss him\" immediately follows \"He had a lot of nothing to say\".\n\n\r\nWe wish you well\r\nYou told us how you weren't afraid to die\r\nWell then, so long\r\nDon't cry.\r\nOr feel too down\r\nNot all martyrs see divinity\r\nBut at least you tried>\n\r\nThe speaker speaks for some group that the eulogized was a part of. They are sending him off with a \"eulogy\", but he is not dead. \"Don't cry.\" Don't cry refers to the eulogized and not the group. The group \"We\" is wishing a the eulogized \"you\" well. The martyrdom the speaker refers to seems to be how the eulogized must have spoken of and attempted to represent some ideal, the \"divinity\", but couldn't actually realize or perhaps even follow this ideal (the martyr that fails to see divinity).\n\n\r\nHe had a voice that was strong and loud\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nRanting and pointing his finger\r\nAt everything but his heart\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nWe're gonna miss him\r\nWe're gonna miss him>\n\r\nHere is the real beef the speaker has with the eulogized. The person seemed persuasive and showed conviction, but in the end, the eulogized only pointed fingers, in essence, blaming and finding fault, but not with himself. Again the refrain of \"we'll miss him\", maybe they will miss his theatrics, but the sarcasm is fully there. The speaker points out the negative of the eulogized, and follows with \"we'll miss him\".\n\n\r\nWhat it was that you had said to me,\r\nLike I care at all>\n\r\nAnother mention of how the song's target had nothing of merit to say.\n\n\r\nYou sure could yell\r\nYou took a stand on every little thing\r\nAnd so loud>\n\r\nThis sort of paints the eulogized as being so self-delusional as to be a lunatic, ranting about everything, but not in any meaningful way.\n\n\r\nHe had a voice so strong and loud and I\r\nSwallowed his fa\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdade 'cause I'm so\r\nEager to identify with\r\nSomeone above the ground,\r\nSomeone who seemed to feel the same,\r\nSomeone prepared to lead the way, with\r\nSomeone who would die for me>\n\r\nAnd now for heart of it. This points to the speaker's ultimate disillusionment of the eulogized. The speaker believed what the target had to say, because he was under sway of the eulogized person's charisma. He was a voice above the crowd, he stood out. The speaker was eager to identify, as he had similar feelings. It could even be assumed that the eulogized person tapped into the speaker's and others' feelings and sentiments, focused their dissatisfaction, and intimated that he \"would die for me\". In other words, this eulogized person, by speaking to and for the crowd, persuaded them that he felt as they did, that he was a part of them, and that he would make sacrifices for them. This, of course, was a lie. A facade is a false face.\n\n\r\nWould you die for me?\r\nDon't you fucking lie\n\r\nDon't you step out of line\r\nDon't you step out of line\r\nDon't you step out of line\r\nDon't you fucking lie>\n\r\nThe sarcasm is replaced with anger. By saying \"don't step out of line\" and \"don't lie\", this has already been done. The eulogized DID step out of line with what he said. He did lie.\n\n\r\nWhy then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?>\n\r\nYou said you would make whatever sacrifice, the sacrifice is your death, and yet you are surprised. The speaker is telling the eulogized that he is dead to the group now, the sacrifice is his role in the group. But the eulogized man is surprised by this. This was not intended, even though he kept claiming that he was a part of them, and that he would \"die\" for them, make whatever sacrifice. He never intended to make any sacrifice.\n\n\r\nYou had a lot of nothing to say\n\r\nCome down\r\nGet off your fucking cross\r\nWe need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr>\n\r\nGet off the cross. A metaphor that people are tired of hearing the martyr attitude, the woe-is-me. Perhaps here, the nailing of the martyr to the cross was forcing the eulogized person to publicly suffer for the group, some sort of calling out or shaming, and now get the hell out of here. You're dead to us.\n\n\r\nYou must be crucified\r\nFor our sins and our lies\r\nGoodbye... >\n\r\nThe speaker is telling the eulogized that he had promised to sacrifice, that in order to be the true martyr he made himself out to be, he NEEDED to make a sacrifice, so the group made him, perhaps not in the way that he intended, and his use is over to the group.\n\r\nOne could make the case that the speaker is subtly angry at himself and the group as well. He makes mention how he wanted to believe, how the group will miss the eulogized (perhaps missing a martyr, as they need that), and does make mention \"for our sins and our lies\". Still, he may be saying that last line as a way of throwing it back into the eulogized man's face.\n\r\nSo to recap. The eulogy is for a living man, a man who could hear his own eulogy. A eulogy is supposed to be about the deceased person's merits, but this is about a non-deceased person's ultimate failings. The \"goodbye\" is the group forcibly sending someone off and away from them.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nDanny from the band eluded to the fact that Maynard wrote this as an attack upon L.

The entire album Aenima seems to encorporate alot of Jungian Psychology. The term Aenima is a combination of the words 'Anima' an aspect of the unconscious in Jungian Psychology, and 'Enema' a medical procedure where fluid is administered into the rectum. It supposedly means 'a cleansing of the soul'. 46 & 2 is about mergind with the shadow, Third Eye is obviously about the goal of this whole process, being whole, discovering one's 'self', opening one's third eye. I feel as though most of the other songs are about realizations about one's self or the world around them, helping them move onward on their psychological journey. The ego is the outer layer, consisting of all of our life experiences. It tells us how to act and react, what is right and wrong (the ego is always right in its own mind), it basically controls us. To move forward and further discover one's true 'self' an Ego Death is a manditory first step.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nL.

If you didn't already know, the non-Maynard sound bytes at the beginning of 'Third Eye' are by Hicks.  He died of Pancreatic Cancer at age 32.  \r\nAbout Eulogy, I think this is the most vague work Maynard has produced.  I originally thought of Adolf Hitler when thinking of this song--but I don't think that's right.  I also disagree with this song being an attack on L Ron Hubbard.\r\nI tend to agree with the idea this song is about Jesus.  The Gospel allusion, 'get off your cross' is pretty obvious--however this could simply be a device to attack anyone who has used one of their own personal afflictions to influence people's thoughts.  \r\nHowever, I think this is about Jesus primarily due to the theme of anger and accusation throughout.  Jesus' tirade in temple, which in the gospels of Matthew and Mark appear before his final temptation at Gethsemane, could be the result of his own fear of death.  Maynard seems to be mocking Jesus' fear of death, or, if nothing else, the common belief that Jesus was somehow greater than simple human emotion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nBefore I begin on the lyrics, I wanna make sure everyone's familiar with the \"ego death\" concept: literally the death of your ego, or sense of yourself. \r\nThe experience is both blissful and horrifying; the ego does not want to die. But those who have done it consider it divine. Many have tried to taste this temporary \"enlightenment\" and succeeded while tripping. \n\r\nWhat happens is, you no longer refer to yourself as \"Myself\" because you can't remember who you are. Yet you are still able to act and think. \r\nConsider an infant, how it barely has any judgement, personality, or experience...but still thinks.\n\r\nSince Maynard is one enthusiastic tripper, I suspect that at one point he reached ego death as well. \n\r\nNow for my input on Eulogy: \r\nYes it had to do with atheism, no it does not involve Jesus or Hubbard. Though it occured to me..\r\nCould it be that Maynard was referring to himself in this song?\r\nThat the \"martyrdom\" was not LITERALLY a man sacrificing his body for god, but a metaphor for something similar? \r\nAfter all, a man's sober mind VS his tripping mind are so different, you could think of them as two separate bodies.\n\r\nSo if, by saying \"you\" in the song, Maynard was referring to his natural/sober mind (ego..whatever), and that the Maynard singing the words was his tripping mind, would that piece these lyric together?\n\r\nImagine Maynard is tripping hard and on the brink of ego death. Almost there. And he's saying:\n\r\n\"You told us how you weren't afraid to die\" \r\nTranslation: \"I've always thought I could embrace this moment without a problem.\"\n\r\n\"Not all martyrs see divinity, but at least you tried\"\r\nTranslation: \"Many people fuck themselves up on drugs, but not all of them experience enlightenment. Yet I'm trying.\"\n\r\n\"Standing above the crowd, he had a voice that was strong and loud, we'll miss him\"\r\nTranslation: \"Yes, I remember how strong and passionate I was about this, but now that I'm actually doing it...I don't think I'm ready. I want to go back to the way I was before!\"\n\r\n\"No way to recall what it was that you had said to me, like I care at all\"\r\nTranslation: \"I can't think about what I said before this moment, what i said is not important anymore...this is too amazing. Makes every word I've said sound pointless.\"\n\r\n\"I swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so eager to identify with someone above the crowd\"\r\nTranslation: \"I failed to realize i was unprepared for this, I was too eager to reach divinity.\"\n\r\n\"You've claimed all this time that you would die for me. Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?\"\r\nTranslation: \"As I claimed, I am no longer Myself. Now that I've finally reached it, why is it that I feel so naive?\"\n\r\n\"Get off your fucking cross.

All you know, is your experience of this song, tied in with the other experiences of your \"life\". This song has no purpose.

Everything is futile and irrelevant, and that includes me, you, and any feelings or thoughts you have about these songs.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nOkay let me just start by saying Pineal11 is semi right about the no meaning thing. In my opinion,  the greatest works of art, whether that me music, drawing, literature, or what have you, is that it is thought provoking. Take this song for instance, differant point of views and opinions leading to multiple interpretations. Which in turn leads to discussions about the \"meaning\", which forces the listener to think for themself, and find out what they truly believe is the meaning behind the lyrics. If anything it could all be a masterplan to make sure Tool fans remain free thinkers, and people that realize they have a brain and should use it. With that said onto my thoughts on the song.\n\r\nI think that it is trying to point out the hypocrasy(sp?) of most martyrs. It is a Eulogy being told by a person who bought into everything. It sounded good, it was loud, like it was something that should be heard by the masses. Spoken with confidence and passion, and like most people, they were eager to indentify with someone. To feel a part of something, but was unwilling or unprepared to do it themself, and at the first sign of another with even the slightest similarity in belief doing it for them, they were sucked right in.\n\r\nNow it's being sung looking back, so there is that latent hostility, as the person had come to terms with the hypocrasy of everything. So they feel betrayed, hence the sarcastic \"We'll miss him\". Upon \"swallowing the facade\" they had a front row seat to the show, and began to notice how this person really wasn't anything special. He was a normal human just like everyone else, he just had alot to say, but at the same time nothing, because it was hypocrytical, and completely bias.\n\r\nThis person was becoming a martyr for personal reasons, to be respected, or looked up to, as in \" wow they are willing to die for there beliefs and to save us, willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.\"\n\r\nSo when it goes \"Will you? Will you now? Would you die for me? Don't you fucking lie\" The person giving the Eulogy has noticed the martyr isn't dying for anyone but himself. This then gives the speaker a jaded point of view on martyrdom. \"Not all martyrs see divinity, but at least you tried,\" because a martyr dying not for others but as a lie, to put up a facade to get others to believe you are dying for them, to try and cheat your way into whatever divine resting place is your preferance will most likly lead to the opposite.\n\r\nIn the end saying to them what had probably been preached as if it was spoken in a mocking way, when you've heard someone say the same thing over and over again and not follow through, you just had enough of it, yeah yeah to ascend you must die, yadda yadda yeah crucifiued, yep our sins our lies, not yours  your not a human like we are uh huh you know what goodbye, good riddance. Fed up with everything.\n\n\r\nOr in a shorter other possibility, someone who has lost there faith speaking angrily about the martyr that died for something they don't believe to be real. Someone suffering so unnessasarily(sp?) possibly the way he could have seen his mothers suffering, he did write Judith with APC, and with Wings and 10,000 days, all very religous songs dealing with his mother the last two definitly the first two maybe. but yeah i'm done sorry about the novel of a comment I just love tool and can talk for hours.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nNow, I didn't really had the time or patience to look at all the other comments and see if this perspective had been proposed by someone. For me, the song is all about Maynard himself, and in the end, about us, the people who revere him as \"someone above the crowd\". The major theme of the song, as far as I can tell, is posthumous glory. But I'll explain my view shortly. First stanza:\n\r\n\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abHe had a lot to say\r\nHe had a lot of nothing to say\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nWe're gonna miss him\r\nWe're gonna miss him\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb\n\r\nClearly this is the perspective he has on what people will think about him after his death. Note that the verbal tense is past - He had a lot to say. The verse \"He had a lot of nothing to say\" is a way of him to poke fun at what he says and writes, meaning that it's important, while not being. Second stanza:\n\r\n\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abSo long\r\nWe wish you well\r\nYou told us how you weren't afraid to die\r\nWell then, so long\r\nDon't cry.\r\nOr feel too down\r\nNot all martyrs see divinity\r\nBut at least you tried\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb\n\r\nAgain, the view people have of him and his art after his death, his art as martyrdom and a way of \"seeing divinity\".\n\r\n\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abStanding above the crowd,\r\nHe had a voice that was strong and loud\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nRanting and pointing his finger\r\nAt everything but his heart\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nWe'll miss him\r\nWe're gonna miss him\r\nWe're gonna miss him\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb\n\r\n\"Standing above the crowd, he had a voice that was strong and loud\" - for me, an obvious image of him onstage but also a metaphor for someone who thinks is better than the rest of the people, a bit like a Nietzsche character some of you may know. The verses \"Ranting and pointing his finger, at everything but his heart\" is an obvious reference to Maynard and his art. We always hear him pointing his finger at everyone, God, warmongers, but how many times do you hear him doing self-criticism? Well, here it is. By saying \"at everything but his heart\" he means that the people who listen to his music will never see his true self, his heart, will never know him.\n\r\n\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abNo way to recall\r\nWhat it was that you had said to me,\r\nLike I care at all\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb\n\r\n\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abBut it was so loud\r\nYou sure could yell\r\nYou took a stand on every little thing\r\nAnd so loud\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb\n\r\nThese two are obviously a way to poke fun at us, fans of his music, like his followers or the followers of any other man like Jesus, misunderstand him. \"No way to recall, What it was that you had said to me, Like I care at all\" show this. This is someone who despite knowing his heart doesn't really cares to understand the message underneath the surface. \"But it was so loud, You sure could yell, You took a stand on every little thing, And so loud\" - this is another critic to the people who like his music, but don't understand it. It's not metal, Tool does not need a label. In this stanza he's clearly being ironic, criticizing someone who doesn't hear his words, his message, but just follows him because he takes a stand on things and because he speaks \"loud\".\n\r\n\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abStanding above the crowd,\r\nHe had a voice so strong and loud and I\r\nSwallowed his facade 'cause I'm so\r\nEager to identify with\r\nSomeone above the ground,\r\nSomeone who seemed to feel the same,\r\nSomeone prepared to lead the way, with\r\nSomeone who would die for me\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb\n\r\nThe criticism towards some of us fans continues. \"I swallowed his facade 'cause I'm so eager to identify with\" - meaning I follow Maynard because I just can't think for myself. Again people, he doesn't care if you listen to Tool or not, just think for yourself. The last four verses, ending on \"Someone who would die for me\" is clearly his opinion that people see him and his art as some kind of martyrdom, and while he's making music, he's dying for us.\n\r\nWill you? Will you now?\r\nWould you die for me?\r\nDon't you fucking lie\n\r\nNow the voice of us, fans, and all the people who judge him. The verse \"Would you die for me?\" could be a metaphor for saying \"are you willing to sacrifice yourself for you art?\".\r\n\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abDon't you step out of line\r\nDon't you step out of line\r\nDon't you step out of line\r\nDon't you fucking lie\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb\n\r\n\"Don't you step out of line\" is for me a clear reference to the pressure a person in his position sometimes encounters, not being allowed by his followers, like any other martyr, to step out of the line. It reminds me of those sacrifices some cultures would do by throwing some of their people into volcanoes, for the good of everyone.\n\r\n\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abYou've claimed all this time that you would die for me\r\nWhy then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb\n\r\nThe first verse is the voice of one of his followers, saying that he's claimed for so long that he would die, now he cannot fail. \"Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?\" is pure irony. Maynard wrote the song about himself, and called it Eulogy. Like he was expecting this album (Aenima) would be his death as an artist.\n\r\n\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abYou had a lot to say\r\nYou had a lot of nothing to say\n\r\nCome down\r\nGet off your fucking cross\r\nWe need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb\n\r\nAgain, the undermining of this message on the first two verses by his \"followers\". Like martyrdom consumers, we ask him now he's done to \"come down\", \"get off\" his fucking \"cross\". \"We need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr\"  or \"now you're done please piss off because we're in need of revering someone else.\n\r\n\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00abTo ascend you must die\r\nYou must be crucified\r\nFor our sins and our lies\r\nGoodbye...\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00bb\n\r\nThe same from above. \"To ascend you must die\" is the clearest reference to posthumous death. It means that only after his death most people will regard him as an unique artist. \"You must be crucified, For our sins and our lies\" being you must life your life and suffer for us, in order to become a great person in this world. As I said before, this is all my perspective on the song, but I hope people understand it. Think for yourself. Love.\n\r\nGoodbye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_19": "\nWhile this song has obvious analogies about Jesus, some of them are as obviously not about Him. Jesus was a martyr who saw divinity. He wasn't surprised at his death, in fact he predicted it, and so on. I think it's more likely that this song is about religious hypocrites who don't practice what they have preached. Also it's about so-called religious martyrs who really don't believe what they are saying. I believe that people who label Christians as people who believe in a man in the clouds have no idea what they are really saying. Christ is not in the clouds, he's not in the sky, he's not in China. Christians believe he is in the eternity of Heaven sitting at the right hand of God. What brought me to Christianity is the belief that Christ will return someday to fix things right, as Tool uses Mother Nature to do in the song AEnema. I don't claim to offer any proof or hard evidence other than what I've experienced in life. If someone judges Christianity by what they see on TV and read in the news then it's no wonder they're totally misinformed. Satan wants the world to only know these things about Christianity because then it's easy to lead people astray from it. I challenge people to really read the Gospels and make up your own minds.

It's not about Jesus, Elron Hubbard, and definitely not Bill Hicks. To know what this song is saying, you have to listen and read simultaneously. Not all lyrics are literal, and many are sarcastic. Understand the connotation of the lyrics and the point of view from which the words are spoken. Once this is done, I found that this was a statement toward people who claim to be heroic and try to play the role of martyr, but for fame or respect, rather than beliefs and actually standing for something. The song pretty much saying \"you aren't Jesus, so stop acting like you are\" in a more round about, artistic fashion. This could be related to the biblical teaching that while one person is fasting, they should keep it to themselves, rather than proclaim it to the entire world.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_23": "\nThe meaning of this song is subjective to each listener.

So this is just what I took out of it...\n\nI think \"Eulogy\" is about a hypocritical political or religious leader. Someone charismatic, a strong voice who claimed he was on the group's side, he stood for them, he wasn't afraid to die, and the things he said suggested he was so faithful that he wasn't afraid to die for his cause. And his facade was swallowed because someone powerful to identify with was needed. \"He had a lot of nothing to say,\" juxtaposed with \"we'll miss him\"  shows the sarcasm in this eulogy. \n\nBut then they realized that he was a hypocrite. He ranted and pointed his finger at everyone but himself, possibly meaning that he ridiculed people's lack of bravery or faithfulness, while he himself didn't hold up to his own standards. \n\n\"Will you? Will you now?\nWould you die for me?\nDon't you fucking lie\"\n\n^ This is the ultimate realization that the entire song is based upon. This person will not die for you, meaning that he doesn't care about the group, he's probably in it for his own selfish motives. On top of that, he's a coward who's afraid of death, hence, he's so surprised to hear his own eulogy (of his metaphoric death). He's afraid of both literal and metaphoric death. And when the 'narrator' (Maynard, I guess), discovers this, it shows the 'martyr's' true face. So then he truly does become a martyr, for the narrator that is... he is dead to him (a metaphoric death; a martyrdom that didn't see divinity as it wished it would). I think a lot of the lyrics are metaphors to express the anger for someone you become disillusioned with (especially someone who claims to be all holy but is really just a hypocrite). I'm not a Christian, but I don't think it's a stab at Christianity anyway.\n\n\"To ascend you must die.\nYou must be crucified\nFor our sins and our lies\"\n\n^ from what I've read, a lot of the interpretations on here seem to overlook the significance of this. To ascend you must die, but you won't die for us, will you (i.e. we've discovered your hypocritical and cowardly nature)? Now I think this is where the perspective changes a bit and speaks to the foolishness of us (the followers), not them (the supposed leaders). It says to the leaders, if you want your position to be elevated in our eyes (to ascend), you must die (meaning you must be brave enough to face death). And why do we desire someone brave enough to stand up to death? Why are we even holding the fact that this person is a selfish coward who's afraid of death, and definitely will not die for us, against him? We desperately seek some ideal person like this, and hold people up to high standards, so that their 'crucifixion' for us can absolve us of the guilt and burden of our own sins. \n\nIsn't it easy to smile and feel weightless when you can rest assured that someone powerful can die or has died for you?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_26": "\nI think it refers to ones ego\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_27": "\nThis song is about the Jesus syndrome.

Growing up in the heart of Baptist Ohio...along the halls of the Bible Belt...Maynard was exposed to some of the most horrific nature humanity has to offer.  The people who showed him this terrible humanity happened to be devout followers of this faith...in short, they supposedly represented the faith and Jesus, and it, in Maynard's eyes, represented them.  I am of course refering to Maynard's parents, especially his abusive stepfather.  Maynard is a very practical fellow...a steadfast believer in practicing what you preach.  He's learned that honest people are hard to find because honesty is NOT an inate human characteristic.  He believes that honesty does not come with adherence to sheep-like dogma that is a facade for an evil which he is very familiar with: evangilism or preaching for money.  Maynard is a steadfast believer in alterior motives and the coniving nature of humanity.  He's seen it in his pedifile stepfather...a father-son trust built so he can take advantage of a defenseless child who doesn't know any better.  In Maynard's eyes, for someone (Jesus) to recruit followers by promising them something so stupendous and amazing (everlasting life in heaven) is the highest crime of dishonesty and hypocracy, and definitely facades an alterior motive.  This parallels the love and trust Maynard's stepfather promised him, which in the end wound up being a misnomer for his pedifiliac tendancies, another facade for alterior motives.  Maynard says that martyrism is absolutely ridiculous because it is human nature to be GREEDY AND SELFISH, something no one can trust.  Maynard sees philosophy evolve for humanity.  The lowest level being conformity, adhering to the masses mindlessly.  The middle level, and the level of greed and exploitation is the level of non-conformity, or rebel without a cause (but actually with a cause, whether it be fame, fortune, etc. and alterior motive)....Maynard sees Jesus in this category and does he place his stepfather there.  A more enlightened Maynard believes that he and his fan would fall into the more educated category, the third tier, which is do whatever you feel is right whether it be conforming or not...you make the choices in your life and not have others make them for you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_86": "\nSome people have said that this was about the drill instructers while maynard was training to be a SEAL.

I believe Maynard grew up in a Christian environment, it didn't meet his needs, so rebelion was the only way to comfort his feelings.

The message is - Tool is a band that catches you by the cool songs, draws you into to the lyrics by making them \"more than face value\", then hooks you into 'forming your own ideas', which are in fact their ideas.  The deversion here is, when in fact we do come to the conclusion of the song's underlined meaning, we are told 'Tool is so much deeper than that.'

I definatley respect Christians too. The only thing i don't like about Chritianity is the superirority that they think they have over everyone else. They say even in the 10 comandments(sorry dont' know how to spell that), that you must only belive in \"God\", (Their God), you must have FULL faith in Him, and let him be your savior. Well that's fine and dandy if your Christian, but they are basically saying that they are the only ones that are right- being arogant and egotistical.  If you do your own thing and have rules for yourselves that's fine, but you CANNOT force others to join you and tell them they're wrong because they beleive in something else. They also say that humans must be dependant on God and everything, and that we are all sinners and jesus christ died for us. Sure watever, but that doesn't make everyone else a sinner if you beleive in something else. \r\nLittle story. i had this friend who was the same ethnicity as i was but he was Christian (I was Hindu). he always invited me to his church and gave me packages teaching me about Christianity, telling me that Christianty was the only right religion, and to come seek guidance and give my sould to God so that i can be \"saved\".

I'd also like to state that Maynard is brilliant and should be given much respect  from anyone who has taken the time to read his lyrics.\r\n  I'd say the song speaks about \"martyrs\" in general and how they've been known to die for ridiculous notions in the past, with or without gaining reward or recognition for their efforts \" Not all martyrs see divinity\".  There is definitely a sarcastic undertone to this and probably a certain reference to Jesus but only as a reference point.  He probably also speaks metaphorically about someone in the present time that he may or may not have known personally, but that has died haphazardly or through overzealous foolish methods.  There is also reference to the idea that he himself feels he was once victim to his own foolish beliefs and dependency on someone or their ideals.  That someone could be anyone from Jesus, to his stepfather, to a no-name personal acquaintance, or military influence, or even a political leader.  Basically it describes how he wanted to so much to believe in something or at the very least, have someone in his life that he could relate to or identify with--\" Standing above the crowd, \r\nHe had a voice so strong and loud and I \r\nSwallowed his facade 'cause I'm so \r\nEager to identify with \r\nSomeone above the ground\" and I think that is clearly  depicted there. That this person be a person that was alive in the current times, rather than be a dependent on the old and outdated philosophies and beliefs of the dead, i.e.: Jesus, Hitler, Hubbard.  As for the loud and over-confident voice he refers to, it may refer to the people afore mentioned and all hypocritical wannabe leaders, for that matter, political or religious.  It basically ends with the inevitable cowardice that most show at the time of a do or die situation, and how  some people actually believe that in order to be considered important, taken seriously, or worthy of acknowledgment, one must die for one's beliefs  and or sins.  The \"Come down \r\nGet off your fucking cross \r\nWe need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr \n\r\nTo ascend you must die \r\nYou must be crucified \r\nFor our sins and our lies \r\nGoodbye...\" line is by far the best in the song.  It refers to the stupidity of organized religion and the vain sacrifices people will make to prove unnecessary points that will never be worth the death of someone.  If one truly wants to be helpful in this life, they ought to have the  sense to  stay alive and suffer this world with everyone else.

One way or another, though, the song has a message that can stand apart from any specific target; the interpretation is left to you, and the specifics aren't too important. \r\n-OGT\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_133": "\npeace and grease >.<\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_134": "\nthe \"hear your own eulogy\" line is what i cant understand.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_135": "\nIt's not that hard to figure out.\r\nAt first, just listening to it you might think Maynard's talking about his OWN death.\r\nBut it's quite clear that he is, in fact, speaking of the Death of Christ. \r\n\"Will you?

He has felt the metamorphosis. He is talking to the ashes of what he was before, maybe missing it because he is now surprised that it is dead and will not come back. But that old personality was looking for what he is now, that is why he says that he has been claiming that the old personality would die for him.

Well, I suppose it could be nearly impossible to spot the meaning behind most of Maynard's songs, but it's there--they just love to be underlying or layered throughout the song, thats just the way he writes them. Lets do some delving into this one and find out the true meaning of this.\r\nThe first thing you should know about this song is that it is not about Jesus christ, rather it takes a bit from martyrs in general, but mostly of suicide.Let me elaborate--\r\n(The sounds in the beginning I think represent Maynard thinking about everything this song will be about. The sounds build up, and then explodes with instruments and his vocals. Note how they are loud and not slow at all. I think its because the song has to do with strongly not liking everything he'll have to sing about.)\r\nHe had a lot to say \r\nHe had a lot of nothing to say \r\nWe'll miss him \r\nWe'll miss him \r\nWe're gonna miss him \r\nWe're gonna miss him \r\n--^ This portion of the song is about someone who Maynard cared about who is no longer around, obviously. Lets continue on--\r\nSo long !\r\nWe wish you well \r\nYou told us how you weren't afraid to die \r\nWell so long! \r\nDon't cry. \r\nOr feel too down \r\nNot all martyrs see divinity \r\nBut at least you tried \r\n--^His friend told him that he wasnt afraid to die. Maynard admired this friend, and looked up to him as someone who helped him through his very being, almost like Jesus christ, but not quite. Not quite a martyr either--martyrs go to heaven by dying for what they believe in, his friend killed himself, so he cannot. Anyone who knows anything about the Bible knows that suicide is a straight ticket to hell, which pisses of Maynard because this is someone he clearly saw as someone great.\r\nStanding above the crowd, \r\nHe had a voice that was strong and loud \r\nWe'll miss him \r\nWe'll miss him \r\n--^He was like a Jesus figure, he had a prescance and voice that everyone could hear and understand. It was imprinted onto his brain, but no one listened, not even Maynard until before his friend died.\r\nRanting and pointing his finger \r\nAt everything but his heart \r\n__^He was adamant about how he felt, almost heartless...however this person Maynard knew, felt he wanted to die because no one listened to him...this person he knew was probably depressed or had a deathwish because of it...hence the suicide.\r\nWe'll miss him \r\nWe'll miss him \r\nWe're gonna miss him \r\nWe're gonna miss him \r\n(--^--voices sopken during his friends Eulogy, hence the name of the song.)\r\nNo way to recall \r\nWhat it was that you had said to me, \r\nLike I care at all \r\n--^He spoke about how he felt and what he believed in, like a martyr, but no one listened, but it stuck with Maynard as he remembers during the funeral.\r\nBut it was so loud \r\nYou sure could yell \r\nYou took a stand on every little thing \r\nAnd it was so loud \r\n--^A friend no one could seem to understand, but somehow on everyone there was a fragment of themselves in his dilemma that stuck with them. He spoke and people listened. He killed himself, told everyone he would and no one cared.\n\r\nStanding above the crowd, \r\nHe had a voice that was strong and loud and I \r\nSwallowed his fa\u00c3\u00a7ade 'cause I'm so \r\nEager to identify with \r\nSomeone above the ground, \r\nSomeone who seemed to feel the same, \r\nSomeone prepared to lead the way, with \r\nSomeone who would die for me \r\n--^Someone who inspired him, Like Jesus Christ, who believed in what he spoke. It caught the attention of Maynard, and he was moved by him.\r\nWill you? Will you now? \r\nWould you die for me? \r\nDon't you fucking lie \r\n--^He is angry about what the bible says about suicide, and hes asking if not only his martyr-like friend can die for him, but would Jesus as well.\r\nDon't you step out of line \r\nDon't you step out of line \r\nDon't you step out of line \r\nDon't you fucking lie \n\r\nYou've claimed all this time that you would die for me \r\nWhy then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy? \r\n--^Again, someone Maynard admired, said he'd be there for him, but now as he misses him he asks him if he was full of shit or not, his friend and Jesus.\r\nYou had a lot to say \r\nYou had a lot of nothing to say \n\r\nCome down \r\nGet off your fucking cross \r\nWe need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr \r\n--^In this one he's purely talking about Christ. Maynard used to favor both his friend and Jesus, than why can Jesus die for his beliefs annndd---\r\nTo ascend you must die \r\n--^--go to heaven\r\nYou must be crucified \r\n--^mocking christ dying and going to heaven, when his friend he admired could not go to heaven fo his suicide, when Maynard saw him as someone who moved him and spoke the truth.\r\nFor our sins and our lies \r\nGoodbye...\r\n--^To both his friend and Christ.\r\nWell, thats all I can remember from my analysis from this song I did. Thats pretty much it, and im sure if you delve into it you can see alot more things I forgot to mention in this document. Thanks, and I hope this helped!\r\n-Dusty\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_148": "\nIn opposition to part of what Trexor said, surly there must be some meaning to this song, or we must be wasting our time.

So take advantage of your random existence.\n\r\nThe Martyr in this song is Jesus, but maynard does this song in a clever way so that at first he may be speaking of any martyr even a terrorist who blows himself up for his faith. until he mentions the cross this could be any religious psycho's eulogy.\n\r\nso then what is it that all martyrs have in common? they are destroying themselves for a belief, not knowledge, meaning it is illogical.\n\r\nAtheists such as myself see this as the absolute stupid. The most extreme thing anyone can do since life is a precious bundle of random science, why would any man (terrorist/Jesus) kill themself for something so meaningless in the first place.\n\r\nWhat you must realize, is that maynard is proving that if a Historical Jesus did actually exist, he must have been Insane enough to actually convince himself that he was some sort devine being. If jesus wasnt crazy and was faking his divinity then he wouldnt have allowed himself to die like that. \n\r\nIn other words, jesus is just as insane as a suicide bomber, thinking that he was doing something godly.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_153": "\ni think this song is pointing out the irony of being a martyr. a person can truely believe they are a martyr, dedicate their life to being a martyr, and eventually dying for everyone else's sins or sacrificing himself or whatever, but if you were a true martyr you wouldn't have the egomaniacal sense of being a martyr. it's basically like \"you screamed at us to change ourselves. we didn't. so you killed yourself to save us. you tried to be one with god, oops, you're not. your bad. have fun being dead\" does that make sense?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_154": "\ni like marcel dwayne's interpretation and mine is an elaboration ive come to a final conclusion on my own which has been agreed upon by others who interpreted it the same way. the eulogy is one for jesus christ who's death tends to be a rather popular story The lyrics seem to be shifting perspective between different individuals:  the first verse is from maynard's perspective and the observations he's made which have led him to his own conclusion; possible defending his reasons for writing a eulogy for Jesus Christ the theme of compassion that seems to flow through tool's music comes again as he speaks from the perspective  of the christian;\"he had a voice that was strong and loud/I swallowed his facade cause I'm so eager to identify...\" is similar to what's said in opiate.   then starting at the verse \"You claimed all this time...\" is from the perspective of the now letdown former christian who's found that all he thought was everything isnt really (it always seemed to me that regardless of how good of a message he may have expressed, christ did act in vain)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_155": "\nThis song points to no specific martyr, referancing Jesus to this so makes sense because people most associate him to words such as cross, marty, or any other words found in the song along those lines.

I think those are esseintial to the meaning.  He's basically saying a lot of nothing...Which brings me to my main point here:  This can't be about Jesus.  You see, love the guy or hate the guy, Jesus's words did have a lot of substance to them.  Also, Jesus was not one (if the stories are to be believed in the least) to point his finger at others.  Jesus himself said at one point, \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone,\" asking people to turn those accusatory fingers on themslves before a consideration to pass judgement.\r\nAs far as martyrs seeing divinity, it can be argued one way or another that Jesus might not have seen divinity himself.  That element is not in my opinion, necessary to the proof or disproof of Jesus as the discussed martyr.\r\n\"No way to recall\r\nWhat it was that you had said to me,\r\nLike I care at all\"\r\nSeems to evoke a 'can't see the forest for all the trees' idea.  Appropriate to the theme, I guess.\r\nNow, the notion of Hitler does come to mind when there is mention of one that is \"Standing above the crowd,\" with \"a voice so strong and loud,\" and even swallowing \"his fa\u00c3\u00a7ade 'cause I'm so eager to identify with someone above a crowd.\"\r\nI think the \"Would you die for me? Don't you fucking lie,\" section refers not to death specifically, but the act of forcing one to own up to empty promises.  Hitler was one who failed when faced with this question, as he was not able to deliver on his promises to his people.  Other politicians have dealt with this, are dealing with this, or will deal with this at some point in their political careers.  Take George W. Bush.  He's made many claims over the course of his presidency, that have been dishonest, dodgy, or downright wrong.  Yet he won't admit fault.  Ranting and pointing his finger, so to speak.\r\nThe final lines elude to a figurative cross.  When the so-named martyr's empty promises fall through, it can be almost guaranteed that a sort of crucifiction will take place.  And, usually, the one being crucified in this manner will make quite a show of his suffering.  Hitler didn't, but who was he going to show it to anyway?

Not everyone around him truly believed in him (i.e. Judas) but many followed him anyway.  It sounds like this song is told from thier point of view.  These people followed him because it's human nature to crave leadership (\" I Swallowed his fa\u00c3\u00a7ade 'cause I'm so Eager to identify\"), but when the sh*t hit the fan, they turned on him, secure in the fact that he had predicted this and it is not their fault (\"You told us how you weren't afraid to die Well then, so long \")   After giving him the empty praise any eulogy deserves (\"He had a voice that was strong and loud\", \"You took a stand on every little thing\"), the guilt of not standing up for him begins to set in.  Its human nature again under the strain of guilt to lash out angrily and point blame, to make ourselves feel better.  \r\nHe claimed he was so perfect.  He claimed he was the son of god.  They expected no less of him, and he better deliver.  He better die for them, just as he said he would, he had to or he'd be a liar and would contradict everything he preached.  And as hard as it might have been to swallow, they wanted to believe in him.  They wanted a savior.  But he had to prove it to them.  The line \"why then are you so surprised...?\" is contested a lot on this forum, but I think its more subjective, not so literal.  I'm sure he was in pain , both physically and emotionally, not truly \"surprised\" but again its just a way of shifting the blame for the horrific incident.  \r\nEvery emotion expressed in this piece is exactly how I would expect someone in thier situation to react.  I agree that this song is not just about Jesus, but reflects human nature and the desire to believe in something, to be lead by something or someone.  Martyrs fullfill this need for us.  And whether or not they are right or wrong, its not important, just that they give us something to hope for, to trust as truth.\r\nThis song also reminds me of the uglier side of our culture, the two-facedness we all have.  The side that brings others down to your level, again to make you feel adequate.  I'm sure we've all been nice to someone's face, then as soon as they were gone, talked crap about them  (\"He had a lot of nothing to say\", \"Like I care at all\")  It is ironic to think that one of the most culturaly revered humans to walk the planet probobly dealt with the same treatment we would give an unliked manager or boss.  \r\nTo me, this song is pointing out how much we've failed to evolve as a culture, and that maybe its time to.  Whether you believe Christ is the Savior or not, he makes the classic martyr and his story shows us the side of ourselves that we do not often like to confront.  Going right along with the theme of the album, change and growth.  Aenima, 46 + 2, even Hooker with a Penis all to me touch on how we should evolve as a culture, and change these \"backstabbing\" ways. \n\r\nphew ok so this song really spoke to me.  which i think was their whole point anyway.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_171": "\nThe whole thing is about Hubbard.

In simpler terms, if he was God, as was claimed, then how could he forsake himself?  The only sensible answer was that he was faking it, and if that was true, then everything he preached or taught is rife with hypocrisy and debased by that action.  Of course, Tool, in their brilliant way, have made the song not just an exposure of Christ, but of every other leader who would claim the unclaimable as their inspiration.  It can be seen and applied definitely in the sense of modern evangelists, as well as any who would presume to make a martyr of themselves for personal gain, hedging on the fact that it won't actually come to their death, as well as any who would claim to know the mind of God.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_174": "\nand as an answer to the question of bill hicks, the album is a tribute to him, and if you listen to the mans comedy, you will find that each of the songs on the album (with the exception of a few of the inerludes) is in someway connected or related to themes from his standup.  Bill Hicks and Tool got along so famously that he used to open for them on occasion, and is quoted at the beginning of \"Third Eye\" (the whole \"I think drugs have done some good things for us\" bit).  The entire album is in some way connected with Bill Hicks philosophy and was at least in part inspired by it.  Anyone who loves this band and can understand its philosophy would find Bill Hicks right up their alley.  On a side note, Bill Hicks produced the comedy group sacred cow productions, which is responsible for such notables as Joe Rogan and Doug Stanhope (man show hosts) as well as the ever entertaining Alex Jones, whose website infowars.com gathers evidence of the ways in which we are controlled without our knowledge.  The whole concept behind Sacred Cow is to expose the illusion that is what we perceive as reality and to form a new system around the needs and demands of the present situation.  And the name Sacred Cow is the result of a rather amusing tale from Bill's standup - but I'll leave the people who read this to figure that one out - a vague hint would be that drugs have done some good things for us.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_175": "\nA taste of what follows the first quote from third eye, to whet your interest in Bill Hicks Comedy and Philosophy:\r\n\"I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do, and if you don't believe drugs have done some good things for us, do me a favor.

I'm definitely not the biggest Tool buff here (or Maynard buff for that matter) but wasn't he raised in a Baptist church?  Many preachers try to \"Scare\" you to salvation by describing how bad hell is going to be and how bad everything that you do is.  But you listen and soak in everything he says because you're taught that this is the way to heaven. \r\n\"Standing above the crowd,\r\nHe had a voice so strong and loud and I\r\nSwallowed his fa\u00c3\u00a7ade 'cause I'm so\r\nEager to identify with\r\nSomeone above the ground,\r\nSomeone who seemed to feel the same,\r\nSomeone prepared to lead the way, with\r\nSomeone who would die for me\"\r\nIf Maynard was ever at church as a little boy or as an adolescent. This is him looking back and thinking out loud as the preacher is yelling and ranting and telling everyone they're going to hell if they don't change their wicked ways.  And young Maynard was probably soaking it all in because he too wanted to go to heaven and in the church scene the pastor is the Patriarchal leader (Hence the term \"Father\").  I'm gonna tip-toe out on the limb here and say that Maynard is recalling this and is super-pissed at how gullible he was because you get older and realize that Mr. Preacher is just as fallible as any other human and what gives him the right to take Jesus's place on the throne and let people worship him instead. Hence the latter part of the song talking about would you die for me, don't you fucking lie. Then Mr. Preacher dies and the whole church is in a turmoil and Maynard says\r\nCome down\r\nGet off your fucking cross\r\nWe need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr\n\r\nTo ascend you must die\r\nYou must be crucified\r\nFor our sins and our lies\r\nGoodbye... \r\nSo there it is just die and let the next fool martry take your place and continue this cycle.  I know you all like to turn Maynard's lyrics into Math equations and the like, but it jumped out and hit me like a brick maybe because I was also raised in Church.  You have to stop following religion and follow your own heart. Don't be a fucking Zombie for Christ.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_183": "\nI believe this song is about Jesus.

Maynard says that Christ was a hypocrit in how he lived his life and how he talked. \r\nI think many times Maynard makes a point that he was a Christian at one time. \r\n He says- \"No way to recall\r\nWhat it was that you had said to me,\r\nLike I care at all\"\r\nHe says me meaning that at one time Christ was a part of Maynard's life and beliefs.\r\nAlso when Maynard says-\r\nI\r\nSwallowed his fa\u00c3\u00a7ade 'cause I'm so\r\nEager to identify with\r\nSomeone above the ground,\r\nSomeone who seemed to feel the same,\r\nSomeone prepared to lead the way, with\r\nSomeone who would die for me\r\nHe says i swallowed his facade meaning again that at one time Maynard believed in Chirst and what he said.\r\nI think the meaning of hatred for God stems from Christ's death covering all and Maynard believing that it had no personal association with his life.  For someone to do something for everyone seems impersonal.  This feeling could stem from Maynard's military experience because he saw his fellow country men die for the lives of civilians just like he believes Christ did.  He sees the sacrifices that his military companions made as the same as Christ.\r\nWhen Maynard says \"Would you die for me\" he is asking Christ if he would die a death and go through the same sufferings, as he has already done for all, specifically for him (Maynard).  He desires that personal relationship and feeling from Christ that he doesn't or didn't connect with now or in the past.\r\nThe last part of the song:\r\n\"To ascend you must die\r\nYou must be crucified\r\nFor our sins and our lies\r\nGoodbye...\"\r\nThis is something that only a Christian would believe.  He refers to Christ's resurection from the grave after the crucifiction.  He also refers to the crucifiction as a death for the sins and lies of people, an atonement.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_185": "\nAm I the only one who finds the beginning of the song annoying as fuck?

Maynard really loved this friend of his. He was special, and captured his awe, just like that of another 'holy man,'--aka Jesus Christ.\r\nNow the twist to this is that Maynard is so loud and angry in this song, is because in the Bible, if you kill yourself, its a garanteed ticket to hell. When Maynard hears this, he becomes angry.\r\nHow can Jesus die for his beliefs with such a life about him, but when it came to maynards friend, he didnt save Maynard like he preached he would. This makes Maynard question his beliefs in religion, about how unfair loosing someone so special to him could be damned, yet when Jesus comes along as an almighty figure that Maynard could give a shit less about goes to heaven, and yet in his eyes he views both of thier deaths in the end as rather needless and stupid.\n\r\n\"You claimed all this time that you would die for me then why then are you so suprised when you hear your own Eulogy.\n\r\nWould you now, would you die for me, dont you fucking lie...\"\n\r\nI agree with maynard in this case.

There are people who will die for their religion out there, for example, the 911 incident a few years back.

This song is showing the band's disgust at the man and his followers and those throughout history like them.

He had a lot to say (father)..... We'll miss him (family)..... What would you say to an overbearing preachy father? When someone is lead to believe that they need to have faith in what is taught to them. When they are pointed down at for their actions or decisions in life. When those rants are directed without searching ones heart for the forgiveness and or understanding of the actions of those who are made of the same blood. When your lead to believe that a farther is a protector and would give his life for his spawn. When that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drilled into someone through arrogance, instilling a sense of righteousness over a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existence.

Will you now?\r\nWould you die for me?\r\nDon't you fucking lie\n\r\nDon't you step out of line\r\nDon't you step out of line\r\nDon't you step out of line\r\nDon't you fucking lie\n\r\nThat sounds like growing up in a household where an individual is not being able to live up to a fathers expectations. Yet they try to impress when they are young. A person wants to do the best they can, to gain that affection of the person they can't impress. When we are children we usually don't know any better...... As someone gets older they may realize the hypocrisy of the words being spoken to them, and question what is being preached. Stepping out of line.......  \n\r\nYou've claimed all this time that you would die for me\r\nWhy then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?\n\r\nYou had a lot to say\r\nYou had a lot of nothing to say\n\r\nCome down\r\nGet off your fucking cross\r\nWe need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr\n\r\nTo ascend you must die\r\nYou must be crucified\r\nFor our sins and our lies\r\nGoodbye...\n\r\nNow in the final hours of life, one might confront the things that have been built up for years. The chance to finalize the emotions. To show the hurt and make peace, only to be reconfirmed in the hatred of someone through their lack of compassion and blinding faith in religious right. The very last lines have a huge part of this short story. All that was taught in life was a sense of the fathers righteousness being. That his sons lack of faith and sins will be forgiven once the father ascended into heaven.

The problem with your rant is that it isn't in any way factual. No-one knows how Jesus was or how he projected his views! History as a tendency to exaggerate. My whole view on religion is that it is merely writing, doctrines that people feed into, to find some righteous way of living, they recognize with these beings who believe they have some sort of Divinity and higher ground, people use religion as a tool(no pun intended) to make their way through life. These people are what this song often refers too. I believe it is more targeted at L. Ron Hubbard mainly because Maynard as quite the disdain for him, also it is noted MJK is no advocate of Jesus C either!. But the reason I mentioned Jesus is because in my opinion he is one of the earliest and widely renown Martyrs; a guy who believed he was the one, the person who was sent here to show us Humans the way and if we believe him and follow his lead we too will find divinity! He also claimed that he was dying for us, it was necessary that he did this in order for us to progress as a race, this affected so, so many individuals and that is why it is so popular, some guy told us he was willing to die for us and by this 'courageous' act he developed such a loyal following that has continued right till this day.\n\r\nThat is why I mentioned Jesus, because he was one of the first to do this, rant about things and tell people how they can be the best they can be.

Whether or not Jesus was real, or even truly righteous is irrelevant. Part of the theory that came to be known as \"Christianity\" was that Jesus WAS all of those things, righteous, soft-spoken, he leveled with the people, etc. According to the Bible, from which Christians base all of their religious understanding, Jesus died for the sins of the people. Whether this account was fictional or not will always be left up to debate. But the story remains the same.\r\nThat is why I still think the allusions to the Bible in this song are used figuratively.

And whether you like it or not \"Ifur555Im666\" is by *far* the most level-headed post I have read, that attempts to look at the Jesus assumption objectively.  I 100% believe this to be true.  And as he's already pointed out there is *no* substantial evidence this is about Jesus...no similes, metaphors, alliteration, or description that points to the contrary...\n\r\nAs I said this is a generic realization about a type of person that was *triggered* by a real person.  Why is this?  Because of the lack of evidence pointing it to any one person #2.  And #1 because Maynard is *not* that closed minded or self-indulged (like some of you righteous fools) to clamor over one mans mis-dealings.  No sir, it's about this:\n\r\nPeople use the concept that \"they would die for\" you to impose their ideology.  They use the idea of a martyr (without actually dieing) to obtain followers and gain the peoples trust (Eager to identify with...would you die for me?).  He says \"would you die for me\" in a seductive wanting to believe tone.  He wants to trust what this man says because he really would die for him and those beliefs he's spreading.  However, all the while they never *really* wanted/or would die for you (why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?).  They just said it so you would believe they crap they were spouting (nothing to say).\n\r\nThe narrator reflecting on this realizes this (that's the epiphany).  However, the masses that follow him do not.  Once he dies, they look for the next \"martyr\" that will die for them.  And the cycle continues.\n\r\nAnyway, the whole point of the song again, is very very simple.  It's people *using* the idea of martyrdom to gain the trust of others and impose their ideals, when really they have no intention, no desire, nor would they die for those followers.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_371": "\nWow...that's all I can say.

Between the ranting, standing above the crowd, cross references, and mentions of death (as well as the title), I'm leaning towards a broader meaning. I think the song is about people with unjustified positions of power, or leaders who are leading for the wrong reasons...in general. Jesus didn't rant and point fingers. Hubbard didn't have anything to do with a cross. I don't think the song was meant for a particular person. You could apply it to religious figures, you could apply it to Hitler, you could apply it to terrorism, and a you could apply it to a lot more. \n\r\nI particularly like the parts that question the subject's faith.

If you read a bit about Bill Hicks' time with Tool, or have ever heard Maynard speak about Hicks, then you'll know that this song is about him.\r\nPretty sure that L. Ron Hubbard and Tool never spoke to each other.

Many song are written for the point of being vague and allowing the audience to interpret on their own.  This is not necessarily true for Eulogy, but it could be.\n\r\nSecondly, there is much evidence pointing toward Jesus being the subject of this song.  It is not said directly but the consistent word usage creates a strong sense that Jesus is the subject matter.  For example, if you saw these words/phrases, who would you think of?\n\r\nMartyr\r\nDivinity\r\nAbove the ground\r\nLead the way\r\nDie for me\r\nCross\r\nAscend\r\nCrucified\r\nSins\n\r\nAll words/phrases used in Eulogy.  Very Biblical at the least, and the consistent usage of He and Him would point toward Jesus.\n\r\nWith that said, I agree with you.  I don't think it is about Jesus, or any one person directly.  The song musically builds from one tone being repeated to Tool's typical counter-beat mayhem and unifies again during the half-spoken line about your own eulogy, where it breaks down again.  The song is apparently about order being derived out of nothing, trying to be controlled by one or few and the inevitable breakdown that ensues.  This is very close to what you said, but where I disagree is where you said it was about martyrdom.  I don't feel that it is about anything specific, but about human nature in general.  You can input any subject or human action in and Eulogy works for it.  \n\r\nPersonally, I feel that Maynard chose to vaguely reference Jesus (L. Ron Hubbard, Bill Hicks, whoever you choose to see) as a vehicle to deliver this story.  The answer to the mystery of this song is not in the lyrics, but the progression of the music itself.  Maynard says that the lyrics are just a part of the song, and its the music that makes it whole and that tells the story.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_380": "\nFor me, this song is supposed to be interpreted introspectively.

As far as Eulogy goes, clearly the theme is martyrdom, and though Jesus is an obvious reference (describing the crucifixion, etc...), he isn't the subject of the song (at least that's not what's important).  Jesus is the quintessential martyr (depending on your religion, but clearly the most recognized by the western world), thus he is often the standard to which other martyrs are compared, and that is the essence of this song... the writer is ranting, directly at a would be martyr, and challenging his motives and choices.  One can picture a variety of figures, though other aspects of the lyrics characterize a \"martyr\"more concerned with influence and authority than righteous sacrifice (Hitler, L. Ron Hubbard, etc...).  If one examines the lyrics, they are from two perspectives; one is an audience member, a willing sheep looking on and soaking in the promises from the martyr on the soapbox (\"He had a lot to say... we're gonna miss him, etc...).  The more important and powerful perspective however, is the dialogue that the writer engages in directly with the would be martyr... thus we find that the real message behind the song is accountability.  He directly challenges the martyr, (don't you fucking lie, don't you step out of line) in the same way that an audience member would expect their leader to deliver on their promises.  Also (presumably posthumously), and says, \"was it worth it?\"  which is specifically and eloquently brutal in the line \"Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?\"  The meaning here is that he's suggesting the leader was insincere in his desire to be a martyr, and that he never expected to actually die and be eulogized (and that the eulogy would be so vehemently pessimistic and critical).  In a nutshell, the song is about holding your leaders/martyrs accountable, and the lyrics challenge the choice of the martyr in doing so if their message or motive was vanity.\r\n*Also, I believe the lyric is \"swallowed his DESIGN\" not \"facade,\" though the latter works as well.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_429": "\nI agree with the comment about Martyrs, The album is dedicated to Bill Hicks so i think it has a lot to do with that and definetley invokes a lot of what Bill Hicks was about.
