Soon after his father\u00e2\u0080\u0098s death, he discovered \u00e2\u0080\u009cMetallica\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cFade to Black\u00e2\u0080\u009d.   For weeks, I could hear him (alone in his room), learning to play \u00e2\u0080\u009cFade to Black \u00e2\u0080\u009c.  It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take him very long.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFade to Black\u00e2\u0080\u009d played by a grieving teenager on an acoustic guitar is music straight from the heart. \n\r\nThe lyrics of \u00e2\u0080\u009cFade to Black\u00e2\u0080\u009d, more than likely, have different meanings for different people.   For my son, I believe the lyrics of \u00e2\u0080\u009cFade to Black\u00e2\u0080\u009d are about grieving and learning about one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own mortality.   \n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLife it seems will fade away, Drifting further every day\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Realizing people WILL & DO die!  And, that someday you will die too!\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGetting lost within myself, Nothing matters, no one else\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Dealing with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own feelings about the loss of someone they love deeply.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have lost the will to live, Simply nothing more to give\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Not wanting to go on living without the one you loved, if it means continuing to feel almost unbearable sadness.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing more for me\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Thinking you will never be able to enjoy living again without your loved one in your life.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNeed the end to set me free\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Thinking you will feel this way for the rest of your life.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThings are not what they used to be, Missing one inside of me\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Not feeling like the same person you were before you lost the person who was a part of who you were.. and missing them.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeathly lost, this can't be real, Cannot stand this hell I feel.  Emptiness is filling me\r\nTo the point of agony\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Wanting your mind to deny that your loved one has died, then facing reality and knowing it  is true and feeling agonizingly sad and lonely.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrowing darkness taking dawn, I was me, but now He's gone\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Looking toward the future, knowing you will be a different person because the person you loved was part of who you were and is now gone.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one but me can save myself, but its too late.  Now I can't think, think why I should even try\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Knowing it is up to yourself to go on without your loved one, but not sure you can.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYesterday seems as though it never existed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Trying to remember how you felt before your loved one died.  \n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDeath Greets me warm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Feeling dead even though you are still alive.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I will just say good-bye\u00e2\u0080\u009d - The most uplifting part of the lyrics. Being able to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoodbye\u00e2\u0080\u009d to your loved one and go on living without him or her.\n\r\nChristmas 1999 (2 years after my husband died), I bought my son a Kirk Hemmett electric guitar and amp system.  Anyone hearing him play \u00e2\u0080\u009cFade to Black\u00e2\u0080\u009d would think Metallica was in the house!  In my mind, my son is the greatest guitar player the world will NEVER hear!  And when I hear him play \u00e2\u0080\u009cFade to Black\u00e2\u0080\u009c,  I know he is remembering his father.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nWell this song was acually was inspired by when someone stole the band's equipment, but the song is about suicide and Metallica has gotten thousands of fan letters from people who decided not to kill themselves becuase of this song.

We all know that this song is about suicide, but what every one should be talking about is the whole deep down meaning behind the lyrics. This song ain't just about suicide, it's about expressing the thoughts of someone who is thinking about killing himself. A man who is lost in himself and not in the real world. Everybody thinks about suicide when the outside world is beating you down. This is about his own self beating him down and he doesn't know how to cope with it. The lyrics really get inside of the head of a sad and lonely man who lives only in his own head and cannot deal with his own insanity and finds the one true way out. Suicide. Damn people look a little bit deeper into the lyrics and what they are saying to you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\n\"Growing darkness taking dawn, I was me but now He's gone.\"  - I think that's such a beautiful lyric and a great way for Jaymz to illustrate the change that has occured in him.  \r\nto Metallican41:  I think you should think before you type especially on a mesage board full of Metallica fans, because you saying that their lyrics are weak is the most ignorant thing I've heard in a while.

Helped me get through it.. GREAT SONG!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nHey guys. I always like to talk about my interpretation of this song. I know it's written with his amp in mind. I know it's obviously about terrible sorrow that makes someone not only strongly consider suicide, but probably go ahead and attempt it, with a suicide note and all. And those undertones influence my interpretation. However, i always look at it differently, and i hope i can at least get someone to say \"wow, i never saw it like that, not bad,\" whether or not you particularly agree. \n\nTo me. this song is about someone who has gone through terrible, horrific pain and strife in their life, and has lost themselves and become someone, or someTHING else. I like to tell a very general, basic story, verse by verse, when i discuss this song. So please take the few minutes and come along on this ride..\nLife, it seems, will fade away\nDrifting further every day\nGetting lost within myself\nNothing matters, no one else\n--life as this person has known it, is fading away, and will soon be gone. Every day he wakes up, realizing that things have piled up, and he's one big tragedy away from completely losing himSELF, his MIND, EVERYTHING. All the crap that has been happening and piling on is causing a change, his mind races, and he's getting LOST within himself, his feelings, his thoughts. The last line speaks for itself--nothing matters anymore, no one matters anymore. Right about now, this is the straw the broke the camels back. There's no turning back\n\nI have lost the will to live\nSimply nothing more to give\nThere is nothing more for me\nNeed the end to set me free\n--Perhaps his/her spouse left them. Perhaps a loved one is gone. Perhaps he lost everything in tragedy...whatever it is, he cannot go on anymore. He sees nothing but despair, it's hopeless. He cannot give anything anymore, for anyone. He needs to be free, but it all needs to end--the pain, the tragedy, perhaps even his own life; but it doesnt have to be suicide. Life as he KNOWS IT needs to end, so he can be free again.\n\nThings not what they used to be\nMissing one inside of me\nDeathly lost, this can't be real\nCannot stand this hell I feel\n--he's reminiscing now, seeing that life isn't what it was for him. The change is permanent. The one inside of him, who he WAS, who he THOUGHT he was, is gone.  He's lost himself so much, it feels like death; the death of himself. It's surreal, in a bad way though of course. He cannot take it anymore; whatever tragedy has brought him to this point, is truly HELL. \n\nEmptiness is filling me\nTo the point of agony\nGrowing darkness taking dawn\nI was me, but now he's gone\n---the void left by this final straw of pain has left him no longer himself, and completely empty. People throw the word \"agony\" around, but he realizes this final pain is COMPLETE, true agony. Now that he's lost himself, he's become this \"someone/someTHING\" else, he realizes this is becoming his new self. And it's dark. Notice how the last line in this verse switches to the 3rd person---\"i WAS me, but now HE'S GONE\"....the transformation is complete. The pain, the AGONY, the HELL that he's living in caused a complete breakdown, a new \"being\" is formed...he knows that the old him is DEAD. There is someone else inside. That man no longer exists. It's only this new one. Perhaps he pushed for this new person that grew inside of him, as an escape from the pain. In essence, he has killed his former self, i.e. the suicidal tones of the song at it's first layer.\n\nNo one but me can save myself, but it's too late\nNow I can't think, think why I should even try\nYesterday seems as though it never existed\nDeath greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye\n--he realizes that it's over. His former self, the man he was is gone, and although he MIGHT'VE been able to save himself, the pain was too much and this was his only escape. It's too late to go back. And why should he even try? Why go back to the pain. THe new person, the dark and probably EVIL person he's become has taken away the pain by eliminating his former self. All those vicious memories of pain are virtually gone, the pains of \"yesterday\" and beyond are just a thought. The new self has taken over. Who he was simply never existed.\nPeople always talk about feeling \"warm and tingly\" or \"a euphoric feeling of warmth comes over them\" when they feel intense joy, even joy from drugs perhaps. So the DEATH of his former self has eliminated the pain, and it greets the new evil person, with warmth and subconscious joy. \nHe says goodbye forever to who he was....and if you are to know who this new person is, he will strike the fear of God in you. Something horribly violent is about to take place. \nThe pain of the old self's life has Faded away...dead...to black nothingness. This new self has taken over, said goodbye to the good person he was....what is about to transpire is that of pure anger and loathing, and those around him are about to witness the unleashing of this new self, in the form of maddening, horrific acts, committed completely unexpected, baffling those who KNEW the OLD HIM.\n\nSorry for the long way to get to my final thought, but i always saw this song as something no one else really saw it, and simply put in two words: HE'S SNAPPED. \nA life of pain, anger, heartbreak, love lost, abuse, etc etc, has been killed. And in his mind, a new person exists. When someone \"snaps,\" we all know what is about to happen next. That is what has Faded to Black; a life destroyed, slowly falling into the empty black void of evil, of DEATH. Whatever happens after this, will be the acts of a monster....\n\nI hope people don't think im TOO crazy hahha..but we've all felt sometimes that we cannot take anymore, and that we're going to \"snap.\" But for the individual in this story/song, it's actually happened...and the end result is frightening...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nosu_cowboy2000 that is such bullshit!

If my sources are correct (wikipedia) :P, which it usually is, the amp stolen was no ordinary amp. It was given to James by his mother shortly before she died. Besides it being special that way, it was also very rare. Also the song is obviously about someone who has decided to kill himself, and what he is thinking before he does it. I feel I have to say this; Metallica didn't sell out. To say so is insulting. Just because they changed their music style doesn't mean they sold out. Also if they did sell out, wouldn't they have recorded something that people would have liked and not something that apparently everybody hates, eg Load and Reload. Half of their albums are thrash metal, isn't that enough. Just because a lot of people can listen to thrash metal for years and years, and enjoy it, doesn't mean Metallica won't get bored with it after years of writing and recording it. I'm not saying that their new stuff is better than their old stuff but lay off em. Metallica rule and if you think they sold out, fine, but don't go round saying it and tarnishing their rep. They don't deserve it. I'm not trying to target or abuse anyone, everyones entitled to their own opinion, I'm just saying what I feel needs to be said.

Also, the song becomes progressively heavier throughout, which depicts the man's despair growing inside him, driving him to his death. \n\r\nThe song was so controversial that some people wanted it banned, but within weeks of its release the band received thousands of fan-letters from teenagers who claimed the song healed them as they related to it and stopped them committing suicide.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\ni agree with echo into darkness it talks about somebody ready to commit suicide because he thinks there is nothing in life for him\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nThis song is about suicide. \"I have lost the will to live.

This is when they have written a suicide note/or their final moments that they/you have walked upon this earth. Death greets me warm, the person who commited suicide is dead.\nLook, I can't speak for everyone but this is my point of view about the song. And personally I am someone who has depression.

And Justice For All is my fav album though.\r\nosu_cowboy2000: Okay, how could Jaymz have written a song about Cliff's death when he was still alive? The song To Live Is To Die is about Cliff's death. Almost all of it is just instrumental but the quote that Jaymz says is in fact Cliff's.\r\nAnd NewFoundFinch, I'm not even gonna start with you, you suck ass and are full of shit.

Zepplin is Zepplin and will always rule in their own right, but a lot of their lyrics do tend to not be very deep or meaningful. ( I'm speaking mainly of a few songs by them mind you, you really can't fin any bad Zepplin, just some is better than others.)

That my friends is how we get a song like that. I've been a metallica fan for awhile and it has introduced me to alot of wat I would call good music. The song itself is not about suicide. The guy is just depressed as hell to the pnt where yea it would be nice to die right not but i am too much of a pussy to go through with it. \"need the air to set me free.\"  Things are going tough for him but he's not going to commit suicide why else would he NEED the air to set him free. His mindset of suicide is something he wants to do but doesn't have the ability or the balls one. Thats if you look at the lyrics. But the song has a good touch to it and brings alot of emotion out to the pnt where u don't even need lyrics. Its hard to say if this is their best song, i will always like sanitarium and to live is to die. \n\r\nBTW: The statment saying that metallica sucks would mean that they suck as musicians more than likely. I mean that's what they are a band not a person. and when you compare metallica's structure as far as lyrics and music wise they put every punk/pop band to shame.

This song has the best acoustic parts, headbanging parts(take your pick, you should be able to tell what mine is), and lyrics of any song b4, during, or after the era in which it was written. Yeah, that includes everything btw for some of you who are obviously intellectually challenged.

As far as meaning goes, whether or not it was written after the amp got stolen is irrelivant, that could only be inspiration of a dark feeling to put a person in the mood to write a song with these lyrics.  One way or another it's about death.  For some it can be about suicide, that easily links to the lyrics and i dont need to use an example if you have actually listened to this masterpiece.  However, you could also look at it like someone accepting and even being happy with the fact that they are dying.  Maybe even in a religious sense hmmmm??  I mean, if I'm dying and I know I'm going to Heaven, death is definately greeting me warmly (not that Hell wouldn't greet you warmly as well, just in a different sense)  Either way you look at it, it gets no deeper and no better than this song, bottom line!!

It has great lyrics, a great riff, a great solo, great vocals, great drumming (what's there, at least), great bass, a great chorus (the heavy guitar riff), the best acoustic part to any song ever (the first half), and to top it all off it's THE most emotional song I have ever heard.  No other song has made me feel the way I do when the acoustic guitars break in at somewhere around the 1:00 mark (give or take 20 seconds, i don't remember) and no other song has a solo as meaningful and telling as the one in Fade To Black.  Even if there were no words at all in this song, the music itself tells a story and when the solo hits its peak and the narrator presumably ends their life, it will bring tears to your eyes.  And then, so as never to have a dull moment, the song fades out almost immediately after the solo.\n\r\nI dare anyone to find me a better song than this.

This guy is drifting into a madness that few people have, and he's about to do something INCREDIBLY vicious and grim and drastic, and whether or not he gets killed afterwards, or kills himself afterwards, that \"old\" him, that person he was..that person is GONE\r\n\"growning darkness taking dawn, i was me but now he's gone\" \r\n---i think, CLEARLY, this guy has lost his mind, split into another person (speaking about himself in the 3rd person) and this new, evil version of himself has risen out of his old self fading away. \r\nIts easy to look at this song and say \"someone is so sad and depressed, he thinks about suicide.\" But i think the harder, faster parts of this song insinuate this is more than just some guy wanting to off himself. Those riffs indicate a tremendous darnkess growing inside this guy that has finally erupted and changed who he was into this human demon, and he does not know his next STEP, much less his next choice in life. \r\nTo put it in physical terms, maybe its the guy who goes on the killing rampage in hopes that the cops will kill him, police suicide or whatever they call it.\r\nTO me, Metallica's lyrics are MORE than just what they seem---they're too deep and too good of a band to simply just be what is written. The old Metallica anyway (i for one do NOT kill the band for their newer stuff..the older stuff is way better yes, but i still get fired up for virtually any metallica song).\n\r\nAgree, disagree, i dont care..this is what I THINK, and when i hear the song, that is IMMEDIATELY what i thought.

I get into the house and I drink some of my WHISKEY in a JAR but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ease the pain clearly caused by the THORN WITHIN. At this point even i know the only solutions to deal with the STRUGGLE WITHIN. In the SMALL HOURS of the morning I stare into the dark night and see ORION, but now is not the time to think about ASTRONOMY the pain is too much it feels like I'm TRAPPED UNDER ICE yet I cant seem to convince myself that its my fault, betrayed by who i thought was a friend and betrayed by THE JUDAS KISS now I go towards my bed in this old rugged house, how am I supposed to sleep in THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT after I shot him between the eyes and left him STONE DEAD FOREVER and at that point it felt like NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. I close my eyes and try to sleep hoping it will all just FADE to BLACK but THE MEMORY REMAINS clear to me that I will always be UNFORGIVEN and it worries me because the things i just did make me wonder AM I EVIL. This cant be I was raised right how did I turn to this BAD SEED I know what I did was wrong but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like I am on ANESTHESIA.\n\r\nI had lost my mind when I decided it was KILLING TIME, I ran around taking them all out high on drugs I believed I was the INVISIBLE KID and the opponents I took out one by one where DISPOSABLE HEROES. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep so I stay up looking at the DIRTY WINDOW and start to think maybe its time I DISAPPEAR because right now I am CREEPING DEATH at any point the cops and feds will be all over looking for me. For so long I looked forward to exerting my revenge but that day seemed to be THE DAY THAT NEVER COMES nothing hurts more than taking the life of your BROTHERS IN ARMS. The pain was too much yet still I feel like the HERO OF THE DAY and I decided not to think about what others thought of me after all to the one who I was revenging I would always be the perfect PRINCE CHARMING her LOVERMAN as was the case when she lived and everyone else called me KING NOTHING. As my nerves began to calm I remember what MAMA SAID about salvation forgiveness trusting in God and THE FOUR HORSEMEN but I will not pray to THE GOD THAT FAILED seeing as he let my loved one die she truly was MY FRIEND OF MISERY so I decide to live the rest of my life with NO REMORSE.\n\r\nKnowing my fate as I step into the bathroom that bottle of CYANIDE seems appealing but I will not give up I will FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. Arrested I find myself locked in a SANATARIUM because the cops couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any normal person could do what I did. The DEVILS DANCE is what they called it and maybe this is where I would spend the rest of my days on THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY.

From a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy RONNIE went on to become a killer and sometimes I would think SO WHAT right until the judge decided i would RIDE the LIGHTENING. I know I am SOME KIND of MONSTER but do I really deserve to die. The judge is not letting me off easy as he proclaims THAT WAS JUST YOUR LIFE and now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached THE END OF THE LINE. Alone in my cell I think it seems I have become THE OUTLAW TORN thinking about SUICIDE AND REDEMPTION what to do I cant let them kill me oh the STRUGGLE WITHIN talk about THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE.

Nothing matters, no one else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is a very vivid and strong set of lyrics because it shows how the singer is in such a dark space that he/she is so under the sense of darkness that they are just to themselves and so destroyed by the loss of their loved one, that they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care about anything else or anyone, they are just simply in a coma like state. This can be shown as the stages of Depression and Isolation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSimply nothing more to give. There is nothing more for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The loss of a loved one can be brutally heart breaking and soul crushing, especially of one such as a parent of a sibling. These lyrics show how they just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see a life without this person. There is no possible way that they can move on from them, as if they were their life source and motivation to keep moving forward and now without them they feel as if they have no more meaning to the world. The use of the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing\u00e2\u0080\u009d twice back to back also has a deeper meaning. By using the repetition of the word, the artist is conveying and really emphasizing the feeling of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing\u00e2\u0080\u009d, how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been drained of all hope.\n\nIn the next verse, the lines \u00e2\u0080\u009cThings not what they used to be. Missing one inside of me. Deathly loss, this can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be real.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is taken place a while after the passing, being it say the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cused to\u00e2\u0080\u009d are past tense. They finally reveal that it is indeed the loss of another being. Yet once again, it is shown how the loss is like having a piece of their soul taken away. The lyrics \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be real. Cannot stand this hell I feel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Is the person in utter shock. They can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just seem to grasp the fact that they are gone and they will never return, as if they stay up nights and just think that over and over, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gone. \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEmptiness is filling me. To the point of agony.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Is yet another set of words that have a significant meaning to the whole song.  It represents the total black hell they are in. It is also an oxymoron, as they are empty and feel absolutely nothing, yet the feel the excruciating pain of infinite despair. It continues to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrowing darkness, taking dawn. I was me but now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The singer has transformed into a totally different person, in the wrong way. He is no long the person that used to be him, possibly positive, happy. He now see\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing but a lifetime of living in a blinding darkness of hell and grief. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no going back to the good ol\u00e2\u0080\u0099 days when that person that was once alive and made everyone happy and just the best person, and they were taken away so young and with so much more to give. The artist once again uses style and language with the lyrics \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrowing darkness, taking dawn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as dawn being when he sun begins to rise, is instead replaced by a blanket of misery.\n\nTo conclude the song, the artist sings \u00e2\u0080\u009cYesterday seems as though it never existed. Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye. Goodbye\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d I feel as if these lines are meant to be taken literally. The day the person left the earth seemed a daze, like it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t real. Then one of two things is implied. One being, when sung, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeath greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d, that the person has come to peace with the persons death, and they understand it, so they say goodbye to the person, as most humans mourn for a very, very long time, and once they find peace they then say good bye. On the other side, the person could mean that death is their only option, as they just simply cannot understand why they are gone, and they cannot bear to live without this person.  From a person point of view, I was once in the position of this person, as I was deal with my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death from over a year ago. He had passed away the last day of school after being in the hospital for 3 days. His last words to me were \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry David.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think much of it, as he frequently went to the hospital, but he would always return. He had been sick for many years, but for some reason, he had passed on that day. I had felt and went through everything the song describes, from the depression and anger and denial, to the sound of the guitar and the way the lyrics are sung, but yet somehow I finally came to terms with it. As should anyone else dealing with loss.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_263": "\nAlmost everyone relates this song to suicide - and I don't disagree - but this should be the National Anthem of Alzheimer's disease.

Metallica is one of my favorite bands of all time but I have to admit, their lyrics aren't that good.
