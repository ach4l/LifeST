The song is saying that no matter what happened in your past he still cares about her,despite what everyone says about her.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nBasically he's singing about this girl who he sees hurting from what other people have done to her. But he sees her as something amazing who has such great potential who just needs a little love to reach her greatness, like an angel. He knows he can help her, and she can help him, because together they can be greater than everything. You have to listen to the end of the song carefully because the first time I heard it, I thought he was saying he was going to take back everything he had said to her. But actually he is telling her to tell the people who hurt her to take it back, and tell them that they are nothing if all they do is say hurtful things to people to bring them down.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
