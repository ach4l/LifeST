Maybe a life-changing type thing. Nothings keeping him down.  He has the world to explore.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nHah, oh, me, too. We've got this on our new in-store DVD on rotation, and it's just great.\n\r\nBut is it just me, but is this clearly more Bond-inspired than 'Man From U.N.C.L.E.' ? Hell, if they'd do it, this would be a great bit to put into the newest flick.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\n:dies:\n\r\nOh, lord, help me.

It's just simply saying that he's just told her how he feels and so now he has nothing to hide, and he's feeling alot better now.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nWell, it doesn't look like anyone is aware that this is not an original song by Bubl\u00c3\u00a9. This song was originally sung by Nina Simone in the 60s and I highly suggest you listen to it! Michael Bubl\u00c3\u00a9 does a nice job covering it, but no one can sing it like Nina.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nNina Simone's version of the song is great, but not comparable to Michael Buble's version. They are both good in their seperate ways. \r\nI would have to agree with lilybear on the meaning. I suppose you could apply the meaning of this song however you want. It is very braud. Perhaps he has had a life changing experiance, perhaps he is in love, perhaps being in love is a life changing experiance for him. Regardless, this song just makes you feel good; it's easy to get into the groove of the beat, and the way he sings it is just catchy. Exactly what every good song should do.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nI love this song, it sounds like something on 007\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nanyone know any versions besides this one, the muse noe and Nina Simone's??\n\r\nI heard this song in an ad (not coffee) you see and i have been searching for it...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nNina Simone didn't sing a \"version\" of this song.

Muse and Michael use the same signs : feeling good speaks probably about freedom after comunism.

It was actually written for a musical, but Simone was the first one to really make it famous. \n\r\nI think the song can be taken in many different ways.

The singer is very smug about why he/she feels good, he addresses inanimate objects, such as pine trees, rivers and stars and tells them they know he/she feels good, almost tauntingly as if it's a big secret that he or she isn't supposed to tell, which makes me come to the conclusion that the singer has just gotten laid, feels smug and wants the world to know about it!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_23": "\nMy thought of what this song is about that he broke free of a relationship and hes feeling good to be free.. but thats my point of view.... on the other hand I absolutely amazing AMAZING!!!!!! =)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_24": "\nI love Adam Lamberts cover of this song(: this sing has got to be one of my favorites. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_25": "\nAwh, now this song is a killer. An absolute killer. You can just feel the ecstatic freedom in Michael Buble's booming voice. \r\nIt's pretty obvious that the meaning of the song is one of pure joy and smug freedom. I knew it wasn't Buble's song originally, but I admit I haven't heard Nina Simone's version. I should look that up sometime. Still, Buble's version is just so completely powerful in that soaring big band way. Adore it! x)\n\r\nThis will always be my favourite song to sing in the shower. \"Aaan' I'm feeelin....GOOOOD!\" =D\n\r\n(BTW, just to clear it up, this was written by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse for the 1965 musical \"The Roar of the Greasepaint\u00e2\u0080\u0093the Smell of the Crowd\" starring Cy Grant, who originally sang this song.)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_26": "\nTo me, this song is an amazing emotion that a man hasn't felt for quite a long time! Unfortunately, this man is married and refuses to divorce his wife as he hates for his 5 year old son to grow with separated parents.\nHowever, this long time not felt sense is easing the pressure of him and helping him stand the shitty day to day routine at home and work. Yet, he doesn't wanna commit the beautiful and amazing angel he was blessed with into any relation as the age difference is big and this angel has a beautiful life before her! He is willing to do absolutely anything to this angel as a reward for her giving him this passion again to life.... this giving might even be a piece of advise with the person this angel might be in a relation with... and this might of course kill him every day until his last day!\nThe catch here is to enjoy the journey and care less for the result. It's gonna come anyway. Why bother now... Just enjoy the journey!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
