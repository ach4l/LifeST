But it's more 17th century anyway since the harpsichord is such a baroque instrument and absolutism a baroque concept, and baroque is by and large more 17th century. Those aspects of it that express the same attitudes as this song were working their way towards being reacted against during the first half of the eighteenth century, and after that there was the enlightenment and classicism. But then the harpsichord was popular throughout the eighteenth century as well, just, not versailles-style absolutism like this song is evocative of.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThe song as a whole seems designed to provide an ornate setting for \"prowesslessnesslessness,\" a rococo gem from le mine de Merritt.    \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
