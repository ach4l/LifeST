{"comment_0": "\nTo me this song is just about war in general.  Soldiers go off to war, defending their country, and are willing to give their life for a cause that they may not completely agree with or understand.  The part, \"For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know\" could mean men are defending a hill (strategic point on a battle field) and they are willing to kill the enemy but the overall cause of why they are fighting they do not know.  The part in the song referring to the men going insane is just a typical side effect of men going off to war.  All the blood, death, and screaming sounds on the battle field are enough to rattle any man's sanity.  Last of all, \"Take a look to the sky just before you die\" is the typical thing many people are said to do before they die.  As they are looking up at the sky their life flashes before their eyes and they get one last glimpse of this world and try to take it all in.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song is based on the Ernest Hemmingway novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, and it is about 5 soldiers left to defend a hill and are killed in an airstrike.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song I've always understood to mean about the insanity of war.  Obviously the title came from Hemingway.  After reading the book, it would seem clear that the band members have read it too.  In the book, you read of the moment that everything goes quiet, just before all hell breaks loose (hears the silence so loud)  There is talk of defending a hill, and there is mention of the stiffening wounds suffered in battle.  Near the end, the book's protagonist (the American whose name I forget) looks up to the sky while he is alone, dying.\n\r\nYes, war is insane.  But sometimes, folks, war is justified.  God bless America in her fight against terrorism.\n\r\nJR\n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nFirst of all, I think this is one of the best Metallica songs ever. It's absolutly brilliant and a good example for the band's and his lyrics' genius.

That whole \"defending our country\", \"holy cause\" and \"god bless america\" is CRAP!\r\nThere is no glorious war, no matter what people are fighting for. War was always the same and will always be the same: Senseless destruction and killing. I'me sure no one of you knows what war is like in reality. My mother often told me about my grandfather; about him sitting the whole night in his chair and crying because he couldn't forget what he saw on the front. \r\nSo I hope you pray to god (or whoever you pray to) that you'll never know what war is like in reality.

Don't go saying that being peaceful is how lunatics like Hitler become so powerful.\n\r\nAnyway, I read the book and the poem, and I do think that this song focuses on them, but I also think it goes a little further.

He is sent over to destroy specific targets for the Republic, and this target is a bridge. He works with 2 guerrilla bands, and one of them (made of 5 people) goes and steals horses because they don't have enough for everyone. But they did it during a snowstorm, and the snow stops. They are tracked and surrounded on a hill by a squadron of cavalry and are eventually all killed, but not without a fight. I think the first verse is about that battle.\n\r\nThe second verse, however, is probably about the actual blowing of the bridge. The dynamiter blows the bridge, but in the retreat, his horse is shot and collapses on top of his leg, breaking it. He lays on the forest floor, debating about whether to kill himself to keep from being captured and tortured. And then an enemy officer walks into view, and the book ends.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\nIt is CLEARLY about the book \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" By Hemmingway.

The song is very cool, but I don't think that it is really anti-war.

The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.

The song also expresses the view that the men who fight are tested by a war that strips away all belief systems and leaves each soilder with only his own natural instinct for self preservation and how all the fighting blinds then to the cause they were oringinally fighitng for and how wars continue throughout the ages, leaving the dead behind.   \n\n\n\n\n", "comment_103": "\nDefinitely off one of their best albums\r\nCliff wrote this song after he watched the movie about the book\r\nits about the 5 guys preparing to fight to keep their hill\r\nthe title of the book comes from \"Meditation 17\" a ESSAY by John Donne\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_104": "\nLike all tracks on Ride the Lightning, this is how we can stop war from happening but when it starts we can't stop it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_105": "\nLike doofer33 said, but in more detail, the story it's based on is about soldiers sent on a mission.
