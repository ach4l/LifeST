I bet this song would make me roll hard if I listened to it while I was thizzing.

They only have one night together so \"double your pleasure, double your fun\".\n\n\"And dance forever-ever-ever \nForever-ever-ever \nForever-ever-ever \nForever\"\n\nPretty obvious, he wants to dance \"forever\" with her, or at least in their mind they feel like they are.\n\n\"Feels like we're on another level\nFeels like our love's intertwined\nWe can be two rebels\nBreakin' the rules\nMe and you, you and I\"\n\nThey feels like their on another level of happiness or excitement. The line about their intertwined love is about how they're joined together on that night. They can be rebellious and have fun breaking the rules together.\n\n\"All you gotta do is watch me\nLook what I can do with my feet, baby\nFeel the beat inside\nI'm drivin', you could take the front seat\nJust need you to trust me\"\n\nI think he's trying to impress her with his moves. The front seat part, I'm not too sure, I think he's saying she could make the decisions too.\n\n*Chorus* \n\n\"It's a long way down\nWe so high off the ground\"\n\nFiguratively, they're high above the ground, in ecstasy.\n\n\"Sendin' for an angel to bring me your heart\"\n\nAwww, I luv this line, he wants her heart, duh. \n\n\"Girl where did you come from?\nGot me so undone\nGazin' in your eyes got me sayin'\nWhat a beautiful lady\nNo if's and's or maybes\"\n\nBy far, my most favorite lyrics from any song. He's saying, \"Where did a girl like you come from?\" She changed the whole way he thought about love and changed his life. Obviously the next lines means that when he looked in her eyes he quickly realized; she's the most beautiful woman no \"if's\", \"and's\", or maybe's\". True love right there.\n\n\"I'm releasin' my heart\nAnd its feelin' amazing\nThere's no one else that matters\nYou love me and I wont let you fall girl\"\n\nHe's pouring out his heart to her and it feels amazing! No one else in his life matters to him as long as she loves him the same way and he wouldn't let her fall for anyone else but him. #Romantic\n\n*Chorus*\n\nSo basically, being with her this one night, dancing, having fun, and expressing his love for her is like ecstasy and it's a simply amazing feeling.\nI love this song sooooo much.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_39": "\nWhile I support the idea that you can't simply associate certain words (like ecstasy) to imply the entire song is about drugs, I do believe this song has references to some type of substance.
