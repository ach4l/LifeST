{"comment_0": "\nThis is one of Tool's most amazing songs, and really sums up the entire theme of Aenima. This song is about growing, changing, and moving towards the next level of human evolution and conciousness. It's deeply rooted in Jungian theory. \n\r\nBasically, it's believed that there are three levels of human evolution and each has it's form of conciousness. There's the 1st level with 44 chromosones. These are primitve people's like the aboriginies in Australia who do not percieve anything outside of themselves. They only see one large conciousness with no distinguishment between organisms. Then there's the second level with 46 chromosones. That is us. We are a chaotic disharmonic conciousness that is basically used as a stepping stone between the first and third levels. The third level is 48 chromosones. (Or 46 & 2, with 2 being the sex chromosones x & y). This is the higher level of conciousness. Our destination. \n\r\nBut this is where the Jungian theory comes in. It is believed that you can not reach this third level of evolution without first delving into yourself and basically cleansing your conciousness for the next jump. That's where the Shadow comes in. The shadow is basically everything about that is unseen that you are uncomfortable with or hate. This is also known as the Anima (hence the name of the CD). \n\r\nThe last part of the song sums all of this up...\n\r\n\"See my shadow changing, \r\nStretching up and over me \r\nSoften this old armor \r\nHoping I can clear the way \r\nBy stepping through my shadow, \r\nComing out the other side \r\nStep into the shadow \r\nForty six and two are just ahead of me\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\n\"Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.

One of the reasons APC was formed was because TooL were in a battle with lawyers due to recording writes when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re producers or something changed.  TooL thought they were in titled to record another album but the they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re new record company didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree and when tool decided to take they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re stuff somewhere else they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re company tried to sue them for breaking a contract, this went on for years so during the time tool just toured on Opiate and Maynard started APC. He also stated that he feels more at home with tool than APC, which I think, is audible as it sounds so much.... Uh, you just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain it.

The shadow in this song is the same as the Snake in H \"my shadow's shedding skin\", which represents urges to treat Devo how his father treated him, abusively.  In order to eliminate his shadow he must first elucidate it's comments by looking into what he has repressed in his shadow.

When he has merged his unconscious fears and urges with his conscious psyche \"stepping through (his) shadow\" he will have gained understanding of why he feels the way he does towards Devo, and these feelings will no longer be unconscious urges, effectively evolving (but in a psychological way) which is what the line and title \"Forty Six and 2\" represents metaphorically.

He's talking about people clinging to being the same old repetitions of classic human behaviours, and not allowing ourselves to properly better ourselves as a race (picking scabs - stopping the 'healing' process).\nMy interpretation of the shadow symbolism is that we have to embrace the darker parts of ourselves in order to see the light; to be conscious of our destructive paths so we can aim for a better day.

Our current count is 44 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes, but scientists theorize that the humans may evolve to a new level of 46 & 2. The shadow is a part of a person's brain that contains the faults of their personality. Most humans deny that the shadow exists because they are afraid to face what they hate about themselves. This can cause people to project these attributes on others. It is possible that the song is saying that humans of 46 & 2 will have a very bad problem with their shadow, which might cause serious problems.\n\r\nThis song can be used in explination of the show Elfen Lied. It is a show about a new breed of humans that have horns on their head and invisible hands that can be used to move objects and kill. It is believed that these humans must kill the current breed of humans to prosper, so most of them turn homicidal. This is not entirely correct, as it seems that only ones that were treated poorly as children go insane. The plot revolves around a female of the new breed that is already insane.

However, the idea of evolving extra chromosomes sounds unlike Jung.  From other internet forums I've seen that apparently Jung thought Australian aborigines and Africans had only 42+2 chromosomes whereas the rest of the population has 44+2.  That's totally untrue, and clearly has rascist overtones.

These grids extend from about 60 feet under the Earth's surface to about 60 miles above the Earth, arranged in geometric patterns. Each species has its own grid, which supports life, and connects the consciousness of its particular species. Before any species can come into existance or make an evolutionary step, a new grid must be completed. When a species becomes extinct, that particular species' grid dissoves. \n\r\nA new grid was completed in 1989 - the 'christ-consciousness' grid. This grid will allow humans to evolve into our next version. We'll develop two additional chromosomes (which are really 'geometrical images' designed to resonate with our specific grid) for a total or 46 + 2. \n\r\nThe main change will be a shift to the \"unity consciousness\". Every cell in your body has its own consciousness and memory. You, the higher being that occupies your body, make the millions of different consciousnesses in your body work together as one being.

An Anima is a word whose etimology is derived from the studying of older religions whose explanation of nature is attributed to \"nature spirits\" or spirit gods who reside in natural phenomena like the ocean, the sun, and the animals.  The flushing (meaning of enema) of this Anima is quite clever on Maynard's part.  Because Anima is considered to be an outdated, non-acceptable form of religion by todays standards, it has been stripped away.  Most anthropologists described it as the way less civilized forms of men without science explained natural phenomena and the reality that surrounded them.  Maynard is poking fun at these anthropologists and historians and scientologists (haha) who denounce these seemingly historic religions because they overlook their own arrogance and knowledge (or lack thereof) of nature, and how future men will denounce their ideologies as ridiculous, as well.  Just thought I'd comment on the album title.  Back to 46 & 2...Oberones and Evilangel09 have the meaning of this song down pat...it definitely is the moving from one conciousness to another, higher conciousness.  The ideology (Jungian and Melchizadek) that Maynard refers to is used in a satirical fashion.  Maynard believes that an evolution of thought needs to take place in society as a whole, but he certainly does not believe any of this scientologyesque, genetic bullshit.  The whole idea behind the song is to poke fun at the ridiculous notions of forced genetic evolution in a society where artificial selection is so prevelant for reasons that are so incredibly shallow--like looks, material success, and fame (LA anyone?).  Maynard is saying sarcastically that he is clearing out, making way for the 46 & 2 just ahead of him...as if he was magically going to get 2 new chromosomes.

Chapter 46 verse 2 refers to the Isrealites, God's chosen people, migration to Egypt.  This is what  it says, \"There God, speaking to Isreal in a vision by  night, called, 'Jacob! Jacob!' 'Here I am,' he answered.  Then he said:  \"I am God, the God of your father.  Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you a great nation.\"  For the Isrealites, the next evolution in their society was the founding of a great established nation they could call their homeland...I believe Maynard pokes fun at this passage because as we all know, all the Isrealites found was broken promises and a backwards step in the evolution of their society, slavery.

It appears negative and pessimistic to anyone who does not know tool.  But to me I see optimism.  \n\r\nThis is how.  The idea of shadow I think is from Carl Jung.  Shadow to Jung is what we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see of our self that affects other people.  When we are aware of our shadow then we may change and self-improvement is possible.  Maybe I have been an ass to a person I love but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even realize it.  My loved one may let me know of my own shadow so that I can change to better myself.  CHANGE IS COMING THROUGH MY SHADDOW!  It is about change to better the self.  \n\r\nAnother theme that I see with CHANGE IS COMING THROUGH MY SHADDOW is that we must thank evil, our shadow.  Our shadows that we cast on others may cause problems with communication and relationships.  Yet it is only when we see the evil present when we may change.  Thanks shadow! You gave me a new state of being!  Like the old saying goes: without evil, good ceases to exist.  - Because all of our perceptions/reality is comparing things for perspective, in this case good/evil.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_103": "\nThis song's theme could be the intersection between the ancient, primitive process of evolution, and human consciousness.

Still, no matter how much we want to feel this cleansing, we are still mere pawns in the greater process of natural change.  \n\r\nWith self-awareness, people (perhaps uniquely) can evaluate possible actions, making their own decisions of how to grow and learn.

Instincts and impulses, these are animal-based reactions to situations in life, and usual bring about problems. This is the lowest level of being. \n\r\n2. Through reasoning, using intellect. This can bring more order and and fairness but is full of prejudgices, emotions and calculations of the mind that are basically limited. This level of being can still give rise to bad things in life. \n\r\n3. With consciousness, by being fully aware, we are able to unlock our consciousness and react to situations with pure objective and true intelligence of the consciousness. This is the highest way of responding in world situations; the highest level of being. We can react to situations without unnecessary calculations of the mind, emotions and negativity.\"\n\r\nAlso known as the \"Id\" \"Ego\", and \"Superego\" respectivly...

I do believe that people's spirits (and themselves as the spirit is a part of who you are) can progress to different levels and a human being can truly become a higher being before they leave this world.\n\r\nDo they look different?  Maybe, but most likely subtley.  Do they glow or give off an intense light?  No.  \n\r\nBut inside there is so much change that has taken place.  For example I feel that I have progressed to this stage in life because I have dug so deep spiritually.  I actually feel like my own components have a mind of their own at times.\n\r\nFor example my heart leads me most of the time, I have really learned how to master my emotions.  But, there are times when my heart differs in a direction with my mind.  And sometimes, like a child, I can feel my mind throwing a \"fit.\"  How it bombards me with thoughts of inadequacies when it feels it doesn't get its way, and how I can feel the conflict of electrical current surging through.\n\r\nI know I sound crazy, but after going in the direction that I have gone spiritually and being an empathic (a person who can feel other people's emotions), I am very sensitive to changes.\n\r\nI believe there is so much that goes on in this world that people have not even touched upon.  Why people don't spread the word of the truths they see is because of many different reasons.  One, is out of fear.  Fear of society condeming them (like in high school how kids were ridiculed for being different).  Another is doubt.  A person lacking in faith or doubting the things they experience cause them to keep such things inside.\n\r\nTHis is why I chose to post here.  THis is why I chose to write these interpretations.  In my own eyes, with my own heart to feel, and my own mind to remember, I am living proof of how life is not what is in your textbooks through what society states, it is what you truly experience.\n\r\nANd let me tell you... there is soooo much out there.  I am of course still learning and will be for a while.  The more answers I find, the more questions it creates.  \n\r\nBut I do know this.  Believe in the \"things\" that are over that roof in your house, believe in so much, because the truth is more of what is regarded as fantasy, then what is not.\n\r\nThe truth is about what we can all experience and join together.  One man cannot do this.  One woman cannot do this.  It takes two.  ANd then multiply that by two, and then again.  Hope you get the picture.\n\r\nI want brother and sister to stop disagreeing on what cannot be, and start agreeing on what truly is.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_107": "\n46 divided by 2 = 23\n\r\nTwenty three is the key\n\r\n(Seek and ye shall find)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_108": "\n46 + 2 = 48\n\r\n\"forty six and two ahead of me\" = 48 days left\n\r\nAccording to the Tibeten Book Of The Dead, there is a 49 day period of transcendence following the moment of ego death in which you are \"reborne.\" In this state you may obtain liberation if you can learn to accept that you have lost your ego and accept the changes or CLEANSING you have endured.

Now its pretty wierd stuff and isn't exactly plausible, but look past that. Stop repeating each other and not understanding it. The reason why I find him, and this song, interesting is because, like Jung, he seems to be interested in instinct. Jung thought psychics were the people who were more in tune with the wealth of instincts burried in our genetic make-ups (Jung's cousin). Melchezedek's sacred geometry sounds similiar to the  framework of instinct.  Like birds knowing how to build nests without ever being taught how, humans with psychic ability can draw from this framework to answer questions they should not be able to answer. Progress from within; change, and change is what will reveal what is in the shadow side - the repressed side. (either that or you'll start having incest fantasies. People who actually know 'Jungian Theory', and aren't just repeating the first post, know what incest fantasies represent: resistence to change)\n\r\nI also think Melchezedek is a freaking wierd a-hole cause for one - like I said earlier - his genetics ideas are not plausible, but also because he has named himself after Melchizedek who appeared to Abraham or something and many people beleive He was Jesus appearing to Abraham. What kind of nut job thinks they are Jesus... Besides Maynard.

The ideology (Jungian and Melchizadek) that Maynard refers to is used in a satirical fashion. Maynard believes that an evolution of thought needs to take place in society as a whole, but he certainly does not believe any of this scientologyesque, genetic bullshit. The whole idea behind the song is to poke fun at the ridiculous notions of forced genetic evolution in a society where artificial selection is so prevelant for reasons that are so incredibly shallow--like looks, material success, and fame (LA anyone?). Maynard is saying sarcastically that he is clearing out, making way for the 46 & 2 just ahead of him...as if he was magically going to get 2 new chromosomes.

You must have a little understanding of chromosomes and some science to get this if not just look any of this up online it is all acurate!! it took me a year or so to put this together due to my infatuation with a d*mn song!! eesh\"\n\r\nThe major underlying principles relate to chromosomes and Jungian theory. Some of the ideas behind this song are based on the teachings of Drunvalo Melchizadek. In his own words...........\"There are three totally different kinds of humans on the Earth, meaning that they perceive the One reality in three different ways, interpreted differently. The first kind of human has a chromosome composition of 42+2. They comprise a unity consciousness that does not see anything outside themselves as being separate from themselves. To them, there is only one energy - one life, one beingness that moves everywhere. Anything happening anywhere is within them, as well. They are like cells in the body. They are all connected to a single consciousness that moves through all of them. These are the aboriginals in Australia. There might be a few African tribes left like this. Then, there is our level, comprising 44+2 chromosomes. We are a disharmonic level of consciousness that is used as a steppingstone from the 42+2 level to the next level, 46+2...These two additional chromosomes change everything.\" \r\n\"Anima / Animus (pronounced On-ee-mah): \r\nIn Jungian psychology, the anima refers to personality traits regarded as feminine that are often repressed into the unconscious of males while the animus refers to traits regarded as masculine that are often repressed into the unconsciousness of females. \r\nAlthough suppressed from conscious awareness, the anima/animus influences our behavior in powerful ways. In most individuals,it is projected onto people of the opposite sex and accounts for the experience of falling in love with someone we hardly know. As the unconscious pole of the self, the counter-ego represented by the anima/animus can also be a guide to one's own unconscious realm. It is often experienced as the guiding female (if you're male) or male (if you're female) presence in dreams.\r\nTHE SHADOW!! \r\nIn Carl Jung's personality theory, the ego represents the individual's sense of personal self. The sense of personal identity is purchased, however, at the expense of certain tendencies that are rejected as 'not-self'. According to Jung, these rejected traits come together as a kind of unconscious 'counter-ego' which he termed THE SHADOW. \r\nWe may become unduly anxious or irritated when in an environment or around a person that in some way reminds us of repressed aspects of our self. If a person has rejected his or her own sex drive, for example, that person may feel irrational fear or anger around an overtly sexual individual. The shadow may appear as a person in one's dreams, usually as an individual of the same sex. \r\nOf all the archetypes, the shadow is the most powerful and potentially the most dangerous. It represents everything about ourselves that we fear and despise. \r\nTHE MEANING OF 46&2 and SHADOWS? HERE YA GO!!\r\nAccording to Melchezedek, our planet is covered with geometrically constructed 'morpho genetic grids'.YES!!! MORPHO GENETIC!! These grids extend from about 60 feet under the Earth's surface to about 60 miles above the Earth, arranged in geometric patterns\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_165": "\nI think it has a submerssive piece of the worlds puzzle. the puzzle of urantia.

Apparently, I didn't get the memo about the TPS reports,  as it seems that tool fans have taken the rhetoric of this song to heart.  It turns out that orangutans, chimpanzees, gorillas all have 48 chromosomes.  Potatoes have 48 chromosomes as well.  As far as current anthropological study is concerned, our most recent common ancestor with african apes also had 48 chromosomes.  Every human, disregading a specific case which I'll mention at the end, has 46 total chromosomes (diploid = 2 copies of each chromosome) in every cell, except for sperm and eggs, which of course have 23 (haploid = 1 copy).  There are cases of women who have 44 chromosomes, (occuring via mechanisms that I'll describe below) called Turner's Syndrome.  Since they are human like the rest of us, the Aboriginese have 46 chromosomes.  There is also no systematic evidence anywhere linking increasing number of chromosomes to higher functioning organisms.  For example, king crabs have 208 chromosomes.  While they are delicious, I wouldn't want them to be doing my taxes.  In fact, from an evolutionary standpoint, sometimes you see a reduction in chromosome number as a result of evolutionary change.  This is the case with us humans - the difference between us and our early hominid ancestors is that our chromosome 2 is a fusion of chromosomes 10 and 11 in the other hominids, e.g. current chimps, apes, etc.  This is an example of what you could consider an extreme type of chromosome translocation, specifically called centric fusion.  There are cases in humans where we do have an additional chromosome as a result of an error in the separation of chromosome pair 21 in meiosis 2 of our gamete production.  This results in an offspring with 47 total chromosomes, commonly known as Down Syndrome.  While this is an example of producing a triploid chromosome 21 and not a new chromosome altogether, perhaps the overall lesson is that there is little evidence to support that adding chromosomes is always a good thing.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_167": "\nHERE IS THE ACTUAL MEANING OF THIS SONG, BASICALLY EVERYONE IS OFF, SO FORGET EVERY POST BEFORE THIS ONE, 100% GARUNTEED RIGHT!!\r\n-sorry to be harsh but everyone is completely wrong with the Jungian stuff.\n\r\nMaynard is combining a few philosophical and psychological concepts into his own message. This song is very similar to Reflection. \n\r\nAs a few people have said eariler, the shadow is an archetype of Jung, archetypes are basically what Jung calls instincts in his theory. The Shadow archetype represents the our animal instincts. Every usage of the shadow (stepping through, shedding of it, etc.) is meant as symbolism, he is saying that he, unlike most other people, is ready to evolve. Maynard believes in \"crucifying the ego\", as noted in Reflection.\r\nEgo= Jung's concept of the conscious mind. What i feel Maynard means by crucify the ego is break free from the chains that hold you down with in your own mind. Learn from experience, expand your mind, actualize the unlimited potential that your human mind has to offer you. Crucifying the ego involves many aspects that i will go into depth in \"reflection\". \n\r\nSo you see, Maynard is saying that he has come dangerously close to fully reaching the potential of his mind, and now he feels the change of human evolution is approaching, and he is welcoming it. \n\r\nThat is the message of forty six and 2. Many of Tools songs relate in their messages. \n\r\nWhat refutes the previous arguments about Jung's theory is that their information was simply false. Jung believed that there were three levels of the personality NOT consciousness. the first being the ego, the conscious mind. The second being the personal unconscious, this was our dreams. Thirdly was our Collective unconscious, which was an acumulation of our instinctual needs, rooted in sentiment. So you see these concepts had were designed to explain the personality. Jung at no point mentioned anything about Human beings transcending from one level to another.

I got almost all of this information on this page from a book the band recommended on their 1994 newsletter called Nothing in This Book is True, but It's Exactly How Things Are by Bob Frissell. You can get more info in the Books section of this web site. The fine piece of literature explains that human beings are entering the next dimension or \"Christ Consciousness\" in which they will have 46 and 2 chromosomes. (Currently, we have 44 and 2.) This is the third level of five of consciousness according to Frissell. The fourth and fifth being 48 and 2 and 50 and 2. The book also explains in vivid detail sacred geometry and the future of earth. It is intriguing and a little unbelievable, but there is a lot to be gained if one reads it with an open mind.\n\n\r\nThe most important concept Frissell explains (He learned it from one Drunvalo Melchizadek.) is sacred geometry. Sacred geometry the path in which the creator moved in the void during Genesis. It forms the basis of everything in the universe, including mathematics. The Flower of Life, as seen in the picture to the right, includes in it all the necessary information for the creation of life. Frissell explains hows this figure is derived.\n\n\r\nIf any of you are like me, you have a problem with this idea because you don't necessarily believe in God. Inour terms, the Flower of Life would be the figure that included all ratios necessary for the formation of the universe. Figures that can be derived from the flower are the Phi ratio and the Golden Rectangle. Anyone with a small backround in mathematics knows these ratios are crucial in all living and many nonliving things. If you do not know what these are, look them up. (The movie Pi will also give you a rudimentry backround.)\n\n\r\nAn interesting fact is that the Flower of Life can be seen in the background of the Tool poster in which a man is emerging from a swamp. I am unaware as to whether anyone has scientifically proven the validity of the Flower of Life, but certainly a geometrical figure that included such ratios seems a logical explanation for many patterns in the universe. Many would argue, however, that it is simply a theoretical construct designed by humans to simplify the universe. If this flower does exist, it is etched into all creation. Every living entity is aware of it to a certain extent, but not necessarily fully conscious of it. Frissell explains that the most basic shape to come from the Flower of Life is the Tube Torus, the shape in which all living things emerge from including snakes, birds, rats, and human beings. One end of the tube evolves into the anal area and the other forms the mouth. It seems that since all life might share the same basic information, it might have the capacity to form a unity consciousness which would be 46 and 2. This idea has been explored by Carl Jung for those of you familiar which his work.\n\n\r\nCurrently, human beings are in the second level of consciousness, 44 and 2, but shortly they are expected to evolve in the next level. Supposedly, ascended masters have prepared the path for humans to change. 1998, was in fact, supposed to be when the change occurred. However, it looks like it might be postponed several years due to the abominable state of the world. For one to enter the 46 and 2 state, it seems it would take a mental and spiritual change. (Opening your third eye if you will.) It would require one to have a deep understanding of the world, themselves, and their consciousness. Most people are unaware that some people have vowed to change themselves and move up a level.\n\n\r\nI will not simply rehash information that I read, but tell you what I gained from it. I am not one to accept what someone wrote in a dogmatic fashion. I was very skeptical after reading Frissell and other associated reading. Obviously, what Frissell was saying cannot be literally true so I looked for a theme of teaching that could be attained. The book is very spiritual and emphasizes that people will be united at a spiritual level. The truth to this statement will be tested in the near future if all goes as Frissell said. The most important message to be derived from the work is the call for uniformity. The human race is slowly mixing out the resources of this planet and slowly usurping all space available. \n\r\nThe solution to this very real problem will not be solved unless people learn how to work together. The realization that all people are greater than their racial, socioeconomic, gender, etc. associations is crucial in my opinion. These are all the most petty issues around. The real issues deal with solving the real problems and living a real life. The above concerns are, of course, important but they can be overcome by any reasonably intelligent human being. I have accepted that all people are my equals, I cannot change them, and I do not care to change them. I want to work with them to make a better future. Though this whole point seems incredibly obvious, you just have to glance at the front page of a newspaper to learn most people are not overcoming these minor hurdles.\n\n\r\nAfter reading into such things I can only concluded that the song 46 and 2 is about Maynard's attempt to evolve into a higher spiritual being and enter the next level of consciousness. It is about looking in the shadows and discovering who he really is. An interesting line is \"listen to my muscle memories\". This might refer to the fact that within all cells lies to key to life, the mathematical construct that allows life to unfold in an orderly and consistent manner. I will not get through every line of the song, as I think you can make complete sense of them once aware of what 46 and 2 refers to. One interesting fact is that this song appears to take on a similar meaning as Third Eye. The Third Eye, or pineal gland, supposedly it an important point of access to the metaphysical world according to Eastern thought. It is one of the chakra points, designated the center of spirituality. \"Prying open my third eye\" takes on an obvious meaning once this fact is known. I apologize to the band if I severely fucked up the intended meanings of you songs. If you have read this whole thing, please do me a favor and share your comments on the bulletin board.\n\n\r\nSome of the ideas behind this song are based on the teachings of Drunvalo Melchizadek. Here's a snip of an interview with him (Leading Edge, 12/95):\"There are three totally different kinds of humans on the Earth, meaning that they perceive the One reality in three different ways, interpreted differently. The first kind of human has a chromosome composition of 42+2. They comprise a unity consciousness that does not see anything outside themselves as being separate from themselves. To them, there is only one energy - one life, one being ness that moves everywhere. Anything happening anywhere is within them, as well. They are like cells in the body. They are all connected to a single consciousness that moves through all of them. These are the aboriginals in Australia. There might be a few African tribes left like this. Then, there is our level, comprising 44+2 chromosomes. We are a disharmonic level of consciousness that is used as a steppingstone from the 42+2 level to the next level, 46+2...These two additional chromosomes change everything. \"Rachel Wells (eileen@loop.com) has written this moderately long, excellent summary of all the relevant.\r\nJungian concepts:\n\n\r\n\"Anima / Animus (pronounced On-ee-mah):\n\n\r\nIn Jungian psychology, the anima refers to personality traits regarded as feminine that are often repressed into the unconscious of males while the animus refers to traits regarded as masculine that are often repressed into the unconsciousness of females. Although suppressed from conscious awareness, the anima/animus influences our behavior in powerful ways. In most individuals,it is projected onto people of the opposite sex and accounts for the experience of falling in love with someone we hardly know. As the unconscious pole of the self, the counter-ego represented by the anima/animus can also be a guide to one's own unconscious realm. It is often experienced as the guiding female (if you're male) or male (if you're female) presence in dreams.\n\n\r\nThe Shadow:\n\n\r\nIn Carl Jung's personality theory, the ego represents the individual's sense of personal self. The sense of personal identity is purchased, however, at the expense of certain tendencies that are rejected as 'not-self'. According to Jung, these rejected traits come together as a kind of unconscious 'counter-ego' which he termed the shadow. We may become unduly anxious or irritated when in an environment or around a person that in some way reminds us of repressed aspects of our self. If a person has rejected his or her own sex drive, for example, that person may feel irrational fear or anger around an overtly sexual individual. The shadow may appear as a person in one's dreams, usually as an individual of the same sex. Of all the archetypes, the shadow is the most powerful and potentially the most dangerous. It represents everything about ourselves that we fear and despise.\n\n\r\nThe meaning of 46 + 2:\n\n\r\nAccording to Melchezedek, our planet is covered with geometrically constructed 'morpho genetic grids'. These grids extend from about 60 feet under the Earth's surface to about 60 miles above the Earth, arranged in geometric patterns (see 'Sacred Geometry'). Each species has its own grid, which supports life, and connects the consciousness of its particular species. Before any species can come into existance or make an evolutionary step, a new grid must be completed. When a species becomes extinct, that particular species' grid dissoves. A new grid was completed in 1989 - the 'christ-consciousness' grid. This grid will allow humans to evolve into our next version. We'll develop two additional chromosomes (which are really 'geometrical images' designed to resonate with our specific grid) for a total or 46 + 2. The main change will be a shift to the \"unity consciousness\". Every cell in your body has its own consciousness and memory. You, the higher being that occupies your body, make the millions of different consciousnesses in your body work together as one being. \n\r\nHow does this relate to this grid? Think of yourself as a cell and the grid as the higher being. We will still have individual consciousness, but will be united in the form of a higher being in order to work as one entity.\" Scientifically speaking, humans don't appear to be evolving new chromosomes (or much of anything else; thanks to technology).\n\r\nForty-Six and Two Essay Version 2.0 \n\n\r\nAs many of you already know, the song itself is based human evolution in consciousness by the means of chromosomes. The human genome - the complete set of human genes - is composed of twenty three seperate pairs of chromosomes. Twenty-two, of which, are numbered in order of size, from the largest (1), to the smallest (22). The remaining pair consists of the sex chromosomes.\r\nAccording to the teachings of Drunvalo Melchizedek, who is the founder of the flower of life teachings (floweroflife.org), and the originator of this theory, there are three grids for human consciousness around planet Earth, which correspond directly with the chromosomes in the human body. The first one is forty-two plus two, the second is forty-four plus two (our current evolutionary position), and a third which consists of forty-six plus two chromosomes. The third grid contains Christ conscioussness.\n\n\r\nDrunvalo predicted the planetary rise to christ conscioussness to occur before the new millenium. As you and I know, this did not happen. If you check up with Drunvalo, he now says that it should happen somewhere between 2010 and 2020. I believe most new age teachers, such as Drunvalo, are simply jumping on the prediction of Terence McKenna's Novelty Theory, which navigates the I-Ching to nail down a specific date for the jump in conscioussness. (see The Archaic Revival by Terence McKenna)\n\n\r\nIn my opinion, Drunvalo Melchizedek suffers from the same ill-fated guru/messiah syndrome that struck Carl Jung, Aleister Crowley, Jesus Christ, L. Ron Hubbard, etc. He is no more of a divine being than you and I. Drunvalo pulls in a substantial amount of money by presenting flower of life seminars to people who are willing to believe in someone and something new(ala, above the crowd, and prepared to lead the way). I hate to break the bubble of these belief happy new agers, but the current number of chromosomes (23) is of no significance at all. Many species, including our closest species amoung the apes, have even more chromosomes, and many have fewer. \n\n\r\nAlthough Druvalo is a scam artist, he does stimulate the mind, and he definately has an interesting theory behind consciousness. He also has some very interesting information about sacred geometry and how it relates to you personally. If you havent already, read Nothing in This Book Is True, But It's Exactly How Things Are, by Bob Frissell. In the book, Bob tells the story of Druvalos teachings, and reveals sacred geometry to you in an easy to understand way. \n\n\r\nNow you might ask, is TOOL, who have told us all, BELIEVE IN NOTHING, guilty of succumbing to the beliefs of a self-proclaimed space-traveler who is actually nothing more than a new age space cadet who probably ate way too much acid in the sixties? Go ahead and wipe the sweat from your face, TOOL would never do such a thing. What TOOL actually did with the song, and the teachings, was to explore a temporary belief system (coined by Robert Anton Wilson), also known as a reality tunnel, which stimulates and mind, and allowed themselves to explore a new way of thinking about consciousness and reality itself. \n\n\r\nBeliefs are cripplying to the mind, you should try and explore anything and everything. Even if you encounter success with a particular meditation, such as the MERKABA, or ritual magik, once you start to devolop your own dogma, your mind is dead. Temporary belief systems, temporary egos, or temporary reality tunnels (one in the same) are the way to go, because belief systems, are simply B.S.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_180": "\nOk, the whole deal with the 44 chromosomes.

It is only a reservoir of evil, if you are outwardly a good person..... a tyrants shadow would be kind and generous. See Man and His Symbols by C. Jung.\n\r\nJung's process of Individuation has to do with accepting all the parts of the personal unconscious, the shadow can be the most difficult part. But once you accept it, or step through it as Maynard has put it, you can discover what Jung called the Divine Self. storyteller mention Nagualism, and the Totality of the Self, but in reading that post and then reading Dr. Boeree's lecture cited to us by meddlehead40..... it is remarkably similar.\n\r\n\"Individuation means becoming a single, homogenous being and in so far as \"individuality\" embraces our inner most, last and incomparable uniqueness, it also implies becoming one's own self. ...\"self actualization\"\" C. Jung (collected works of C.Jung, 7, paragraph 266)\n\r\nIf you do go to read Dr. Boeree's lecture, please read it in its entirety, not just about the shadow and the anima...... read about the self and synchronicity...... this is the goal of individuation.\r\nThis song, in my opinion, is about the process.\n\r\nFinally there is obvious reference to Melchizadek and his chromosome theories..... lets clarify something here, I don't think anyone who posted about this actually meant that Aborigines only have 44 chromosomes, but that according to the definition set forth for that set (42 + 2).... the whole single consciousness between that being and the world around it, the Aborigines would be the best example.\n\r\nNow, go back and read that first post and what the different chromosomal levels are and their definitions, then read Dr. Boeree's lecture...... process and synthesis..... and you'll find that there are underlying similarities.  The 42+2 level would represent what Jung would call the collective unconscious, the 44+2 would represent the persona or the ego, and the 46+2 would represent someone who has gone through process of individuation, achieved Transcendence, and is now engaged in synchronicity...... Someone who truly believes that \"No man is an island\".\n\n\r\nI'm sorry, I didn't mean for that to get so long..... everyone here has good ideas...... honestly, Maynard may have just been playing with his shadow on a sunny day, lol, but that is the beauty in the autonomy of art.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_188": "\nThis song relates to the meaning of Tool's word (i can't type it) Aenima.

This term describes the song Aenima much better, but still applies to forty-six & 2.  The whole idea of chromosomes blew me away, yet I think that without going into detail, it can be summed up.  Maynard is describing the feeling of letting himself go and embracing this cleansing of his soul and growth into a higher level of consciousness.

Also the writer wants to connect to his audience which is easier to do while describing personal events eventhough it may be in poetic fashion (though some bands have gone completely artisitc, poetic, conceptual... like old Genesis, Pink Floyd, YES, etc.)  I believe he is also describing an event he experienced.  Some of the lyrics are familiar images or expressions that are well known such as \"old armor\".  I also think that \"Forty Six and 2\", in his description... seeing that he is singing as though in that moment in time giving the listener the sense that we are watching a scene in a movie, is an address.

Now saying that we evolved from apes, would be saying that somehow a pair vanished. Well it didn't go away cause that would be lethal, but what he found was that the 2nd chromosome in humans, is actually made of TWO chromosomes fused together, that would explain where the chromosome difference came, and would also add a lot more to the theory of evolution, because naturally chromosomes don't form like that... so at one time there must have been an original with regular chromosomes.

The next step of evolution would likely result in human DNA being reorganized into 46 and 2 chromosomes, according to Melchizedek.\n\r\nFurthermore, the song references a wish to experience change through the \"shadow\"; an idea which represents the parts of one's personality that one hates and fears, which also exists as a recurring theme in the work of Carl Jung\n\r\nThe song is mostly in 4/4 time with some sections of 7/8 in between. In the intro, Danny Carey plays 4 measures of 7/8 on his ride cymbal over the rest of the band playing in 4/4, and they all meet up on the downbeat of the 5th measure in 4/4.
