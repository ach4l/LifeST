A more subtle \"Californication,\" perhaps?\n\r\nA dismembered constellation would be a bunch of stars that are split apart and are off by themselves.  They should be grouped together, but instead they alone.  There are more kinds of stars than literal gaseous fireballs in the cosmos, such as movie stars or music stars.\n\r\nThe radiation, which has been going on for years, is the unintended(?) message that Hollywood has been sending out for years about the magic of the movies and the glamorous lifestyle of celebrities.  It contaminates people's minds; they are left with dreams concocted by an industry that they can never achieve.\n\r\nThe stars from the dismembered constellation are the lonesome people who grew up in a western culture, who spent all their life idolizing movie stars and believing that the Hollywood lifestyle is what they truly want.  The message is still, and always will be, reaching them, and plaguing or haunting them.  They still feel that they can be rich and famous someday.  They think they *really* belong among the Hollywood elite (a \"constellation\" or group of movie stars.)  The gloomy and rainy sounding music and imagery of cobwebs falling on what these people bsaed their dreams on just illustrate what a sorry state they're in. \n\r\n\"Beyond your... etc.\" When you look past what the industry does (entertains, makes a point, spreads ideas, and most of all, sells) you see the people it effects.\n\r\nThe sad line about flies and spiders getting along together (really- brilliant writing.) shows the impossibility of these dreams.  Flies and spiders could never get along, because spiders feed off of flies.  Does Hollywood feed off of these people?\n\n\r\n...\r\nEh, it's just an idea.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI think that he makes references to quasars.

Even if CAKE had a certain intention for a specific message to be taken, if you take another it simply adds to the song's meaning.\n\r\nMy interpretation is rather simple. The old man is collecting old artefacts in the knowledge that 'he'll be rich someday'. The old man has lived long enough to know that history repeats itself, akin to the 'old skipping record' , therefore his collections will one day be of high value. Cross reference with 'Sad Songs and Waltzes' in which CAKE tell of a cheating lover whose crimes won't be listened to because 'sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year' and it's a warning that even if people try to hide the truth, in the end there will be a moment when someone will be listening the truth will out.\n\r\nI agree with the interpretations already made of the radio signal, but would like to add my own. The source of the signal, like a collapsed star, may have ceased long ago or may play completely new music at the same time that Frank Sinatra has reached stars far away. I apply this to the old man, who may die soon but he will leave a legacy. Summary: art/music/collections of fine things are a way to become immortal (this is of course partially self-referential on CAKE's behalf).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nForgive me for my Tin Hat theory, but I've always thought this song was about time travel. So, in a future world, we are not doing well. The world is violent, aoverpolutted, etc and I guess you could so close to apocalypse/armageddon. So, one of the world's goverments manages to send a man back in time useing a terminator time machine ( one-way, no way back.) \"...while Frank Sinatra plays stormy weather...\" The man is sent back to approxmantly 30's-50's, a big time for Sinatra. Useing the objectives his govement gave him, he manages to fix many of the world's future problems by correct them as they first begin in the past, creating an almost butterfly effect. While thier, however, he manages to \"collect some stamps\" because he'll be \"rich one day.\" He basically invests in things thought trivial during the 30's-50's and gains welath from them, knowing how they would be used in the future. Now, the \"...flies and spiders getting along together, while cobwebs fall on an old spinning record.\" I'm pretty sure theirs a Biblical verse that roughly states \" theirs a season for all things.\" Theirs been so many different kingdoms and empires throughout history, but even grand empires fall, and those who are left pick up and create a new empire in its place, starting the cycle over again. Now, a skip in a record is when the needle has reached an error in the disk, and goes backwords to a more durable part in the disc to continue playing ( I'm pretty sure it can also move forward during a skip, not sure though.) This means that with this new technology of time travel, their will never be another \"fallen empire.\" and that we can just send another man back in time to correct our mistakes, thus breaking the \"season for all things\" cycle, and creating an almost, if not totally perfect, society.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nWe know of an ancient radiation \nThat haunts dismembered constellations \nA faintly glimmering radio station \nWhile Frank Sinatra sings \"Stormy Weather\" \nThe flies and spiders get along together \nCobwebs fall on an old skipping record\n\nThere's a somewhat literal interpretation in the cosmic radiation background. Anywhere you go in the universe, including dismembered constellations, you will find the first light of the universe. It's been cooling for 14 billion years and presently registers on the high end of the radio band of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum (2.7GHz). It constitutes a majority of radiation in the universe, but on Earth we are very close to a star and make a lot of noise ourselves; it's fair to describe it as \"faintly glimmering.\" About 3% of the static on old antenna TV's was the radiation background; not exactly a station in and of itself.\n\nSo it's literally the most ancient radiation in existence, or so the majority of cosmologists believe, and you can pick it up with what I'd loosely call modern radio equipment - faintly.

If they throw in a reference to another song it isn't going to be randomly chosen.  So to understand the song its important to read the lyrics to Frank Sinatra's Stormy Weather.  Stormy Weather is probably Sinatra's most depressing song so its appropriate that Cake's most depressing song references it.  Here are a few lines from Stormy Weather:\n\r\nLife is bare\r\nGloom and misery everywhere\r\nStormy weather\r\nJust can't get my poor self together\r\nI'm weary all the time\r\nEvery time\r\nSo weary all of the time\n\r\nWhen she went away, the blues walked in\r\nAnd then they met me\r\nIf she stays away, that old rocking chair is bound to get me\r\nAll I do is pray the lord will let me\r\nJust walk in that sun once more\n\r\nCan't go on\r\nEverything I had is gone\r\nStormy weather\r\nSince my gal and I ain't together\r\nKeeps raining all the time\n\r\nOk, so its a song about a guy who's lost his girl, he's depressed, sits around inside and dwells on the past, worried that he will never get over it and end up a lonely sad old man.\n\r\nIt's not a coincidence that Cake's song then paints a picture of a lonely sad old man.  Its the same man 50 years later!\n\r\nThe song doesn't aim so much to tell a story but to paint a picture of the conclusion of the story told in Stormy Weather.  The beginning of the song tries to pull us back into the past, where this man still dwells, referring to the ancient radio waves from his time just now reaching the far ends of the galaxy.  It then zooms in back to earth where this man now lives.  Time has gone by in the rest of the world, but this man is still stuck in the past, he has forgotten the world and the world has forgotten him.\n\r\nI'm not sure about the flies and the spiders part, unless the spiders are so depressed they gave up hunting the flies.

The Cosmic Background Radiation, which was found by Penzias and Wilson at Bell Labs while testing a new powerful radio telescope, is the \"ancient radiation\".  They won a Nobel Prize for this. \n\r\nLight is a form of electromagnetic radiation, as are x-rays, radio waves, gamma waves, infrared rays, and ultraviolet rays.  They are all the same thing with different wavelengths.  As light moves away from an observer quickly its wavelengths are lengthened, or 'red-shifted'.  Light that is very red shifted becomes infrared, and finally a radio wave.  The Cosmic Background Radiation is the light left over from the Big Bang that has been red-shifted to the extreme, as it has been traveling at the speed of light almost directly away from us since the beginning of time.  The \"dismembered constellations\" is certainly a reference to this event and/or the galaxy formation/destruction brought about by it. \n\r\nNow that would mean that this \"radio station\" has been playing since the light had been 'red shifted' to a radio wave.  This would take some time, but given the approximate age of the universe of around 12 billion years, it could easily be half of that.  Have you heard the idea that if a huge group of monkeys typed away on typewriters for millions of years by sheer chance one of them would manage to pound out a Shakespearean sonnet?  Well, what if the radio station played more or less a random signal for 6 billion years?  Wouldn't \"Stormy Weather\" by Frank Sinatra have to be played at least once?  Now at this wonderful time when everything comes together and clicks and all is in harmony in the universe wouldn't the flies and spiders get along together?\n\r\nI think in the end that's what the song is about.  We only have the short amount of time that we have been given so enjoy every moment.\r\nwe know of an ancient radiation.\r\nthat haunts dismembered constellations,\r\na faintly glimmering radio station.\r\nwhile frank sinatra sings stormy weather,\r\nthe flies and spiders get along together,\r\ncobwebs fall on an old skipping record.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_43": "\nDefinitely about delapidation.  I think it describes a single subject, but is about a general idea.  The vaguely dark tone of the song also hints at this.  The first 3 lines (ancient radiation) quite possibly refer to radio waves in one way or the other, as many have said already.  However I think the radiation could be the ambience of a room inhabited by a depricated hermit-type; like the erieness of the home of someone who is no longer able to keep up with the world.  The person whose life is reduced to collecting worthless crap, antiques and such.  That ambience sort of haunts the room.

It mentions Frank Sinatra as he is such a powerful symbol of the past I mentioned in the last comment, thus the flies and spiders get along together.  It symbolizes the harmony of society of the past.  But at the same time, \"Stormy Weather\" is an extremely melancholy song.  So as the song plays, it is still able to bring to mind the harmony and happiness of that time, but it has the melancholy aspect of the fact that it's all gone now.
