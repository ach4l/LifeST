{"comment_0": "\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not the only woman who felt they could relate to Anne-Marie upon listening to her new track \u00e2\u0080\u009cFriends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In a world that misguidedly continues to consider the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfriendzone\u00e2\u0080\u009d a thing (spoiler alert, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not), women are consistently berated for considering men to be friends when they really believe we should be throwing ourselves at their feet. Yup, I said it. Anne-Marie goes out of her way in this song to let the man crushing on her know that she only wants to be friends with him; she even goes so far as to LITERALLY spell it out for him. But alas, like so many other women in her shoes, she starts to get sick of finding ways to nicely say \u00e2\u0080\u009cno.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be reasoned with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says, as though she should have to reason with someone about her feelings (seriously?). And then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m done being polite.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Girl, you are not alone. There are several clues, both subtle and blatant, throughout the song that the person trying to win her affections is incapable of taking a hint \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I honestly think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be done too.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
