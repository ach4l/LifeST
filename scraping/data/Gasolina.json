A country and its people are respected in the same manner that one respects God and family. Secondly, it is physically impossible for this to have occurred since I have not visited Mexico since March 2005, due to the demands of my work schedule, which has included among other things recording and launching of my latest album, Barrio Fino en Directo; the filming of my movie Straight From the Barrio, launching of my new line of clothing with Reebok and my radio program On Fuego.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ask that the people of Mexico remain confident that such a despicable act never occurred and not allow such mean-founded individuals to affect the great affection we have for each other.
