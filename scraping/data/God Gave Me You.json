{"comment_0": "\nThe song is not only about Miranda being there for Blake when he needed her it's about Miranda making him into a better person.\n At the time I am writing this, the two are no longer together and have both found new partners. That does not mean that they love each other any less. God gave Miranda to Blake just as God gave Blake to Miranda, they were put in each others lives to better one another and even if doing so it meant that they would divorce and no longer be together, they still both seem very happy in their new relationships.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThe song was written by David Barnes and dedicated to his wife Annie.\r\nIt had already become popular on christian radio and Blake heard it , loved it and had to record it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nWhen Blake and Miranda met they immediatley began falling in love. Blake was married and it was on the rocks. Miranda stood by Blake during the divorce and was always there for him. This song in my opinion is to Miranda saying thank you and saying hey god gave me her for a reason he gave me her for the ups and downs and stuff like that\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
