{"comment_0": "\nOut of all of the sexy female empowerment hits that have come from Ariana Grande's album \"Sweetener,\" this song might be the sexiest and most empowering. I mean, it doesn't get much more empowering than calling yourself a deity. This song goes above and beyond glorifying female sexuality, as the singer tells her partner that she is going to rock their world so hard that they will believe that she must be a god. Then she incorporated religious imagery like prayer and blessings, really driving home the contrast between sex and religion. Beyond the lyrics, Ariana really plays up her slow, sensual singing style to make this song a fun and sexy hit that you might want to play while you're...well, replicating the lyrics.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
