The Gods are the celebrities that are worshiped just because they are famous and everyone thinks they're so amazing. The Monsters are the addictions, sins and all of the trouble that comes along with being in that world - \"The garden of evil\"\n\nShe was an angel because she was innocent when she was first brought into that world. She was already addicted to alcohol, but wanted fame and love.\n\nEventually she got into the world of the monsters and if she was addicted to things, her life with the Gods/Celebs would be over, but she still sings. She kept telling herself if God is dead, no one can take her soul away. When you're a celebrity, it takes your soul away in a sense because you have to grow up fast and your whole world changes and eventually you get into things that take the innocence away.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI suppose some people can't understand the meaning of metaphors or just simply using an artistic approach to explain a situation other than using bubbly pop catchy phrases to get your point across. I think the entire song is a metaphor about living a dirty lifestyle. \"I was an angel, living in the Garden of Evil.\" \"Put your hands on my waist do it softly, me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing. No ones gonna take my soul away, I'm living like Jim Morrison.\" Yup, party rocker promiscuous lifestyle just about sums it up.\nWhile I understand the general public isn't use to hearing words like \"God's dead!\" in songs, it doesn't mean this artist is worshiping Satan. I see it as a way of saying \"Living a fucked up, care free life in a world where everyone is living like there is no such thing as sinning.\" But, \"God's dead\" just about sums it up too if you have the ability to open your mind and wrap your brain around the possibility that some songs or lyrics aren't going to be straight forward and to the point.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nTo me this song is one of three things: fictitious, biographical or autobiographical. \n\r\nIt could be pure fiction, a story of an unnamed young woman.\n\r\nIt could be biographical, most likely about Pamela Courson - Jim Morrison's love. Del Rey has written in the form of a persona before, so this wouldn't be totally unheard of. Born to Die is full of references to Lolita, from the 'heart-shaped sunglasses' of Diet Mountain Dew to the track Lolita itself. Moreover, in the video for National Anthem, Del Rey portrays both Marilyn Monroe and Jacqueline Kennedy. However, I am not fully convinced that the song is wholly about Courson.\n\r\nFinally, it could be about Lana Del Rey herself - I think this is the most likely explanation. \n\r\nThe song could also be a response to LA Woman by The Doors - at the very least there are some interesting allusions.\n\r\nOne thing, however, is certain. 'The land of Gods and Monsters' refers to LA.\n\r\nI will now take it lyric by lyric.\n\r\n'In the land of gods and monsters,\r\nI was an angel.\r\nLiving in the garden of evil,\r\nScrewed up, scared, doing anything that I needed.'\n\r\nThe land of Gods and Monsters, as I have mentioned, refers to LA. For many, Los Angeles, and specifically Hollywood, is a sort of paradise, the culmination of the American Dream. 'The Gods' refers to the icons in LA - the Marilyn Monroes, the adored, the promise of what Hollywood has to offer. 'Monsters' refers to the vices that permeate LA, whether excessive wealth, drugs, alcohol or fame.\n\r\nI was an angel - this could be a response to LA Woman, in which Morrison sings 'are you a lucky little lady in the city of light? Or just another lost angel?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Del Rey answers that she was an angel. Her use of the past tense is significant. She is no longer an angel. This begs the question: what is she now? An angel would be expected to live under God. If she is no longer an angel it suggests she has succumbed to the dark side of LA - the monsters.\n\r\nLiving in the garden of evil - this is an obvious play on words - the Garden of Eden. In the Book of Genesis, the Garden of Eden was the paradise created by God for Adam and Eve. However, evil entered the Garden in the form of the snake, and tempted Eve to sin by eating the forbidden fruit. This is in keeping with the previous line - LA has become a place of evil and sin, it is no longer the paradise it appeared to be, and Del Rey has fallen from grace.\n\r\nScrewed up, scared, doing anything that I needed - she has turned to the dark side of LA in order to survive - this could refer to alcohol and drugs (Del Rey has reportedly had alcohol problems in the past) or even prostitution, whether literal or metaphorical. (Del Rey has also alluded to prostitution in the video for Ride - however, I am in no way suggesting she has personal experience, it is merely part of the story of the song and the lifestyle that goes with it.)\n\r\nShining like a fiery beacon - this would seem to possibly be another reference to LA Woman, in which Morrison sings 'I see your hair is burning, hills are filled with fire'. Alternatively, beacons are often lit as a sign of distress - could it be a cry for help? Or is she burning bright, and will inevitably burn out.\n\r\nYou've got that medicine I need, \r\nFame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly - who is she speaking to here? Possibly the city itself. She has become addicted to the lifestyle in the city and all that comes with it.\n\r\nPut your hands on my waist, do it softly - this is an image of seduction. She is still being drawn in to the city. Again, the question is raised \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to whom is she speaking? Los Angeles or a specific person? Perhaps Morrison, who represents the dark side of life in LA for a troubled but brilliant artist.\n\r\nMe and God, we don't get along, so now I sing - if the land is one of 'Gods and Monsters', and she doesn't get along with God, that suggests she has joined or associates with the monsters. Again this comes back to the dark side of LA and the American Dream.\n\r\nNo one's gonna take my soul away,\r\nI'm living like Jim Morrison - Del Rey will not compromise who she is or what she does. This is highly existential - she will live in the moment, true to herself. If that means being drawn to darkness, that's where she'll go. Morrison was the ultimate self-destructive artist. He lived on his own terms and could not be tamed or controlled. He was a poet, an artist, an intangible chameleon, a Dionysus. He did what he wanted and allowed others to pick up the pieces - which they inevitably did. He lived fast, and died young - a member of the infamous '27 club'. Ultimately his lifestyle got the better of him, and he died in Paris. In some ways his death could be seen as an escape - he was tired of the fame and the rock star persona, he wanted to be a serious artist and viewed his lyrics as poetry. However, he has been immortalised in his music. Perhaps this is why no one can take Del Rey's soul? She has poured it into her own music. Just like Morrison, she is living life on her own terms, full of the vice of LA, the 'monsters'.\n\r\nHeaded towards a fucked-up holiday - as mentioned above, Jim Morrison died in Paris. Does Del Rey see herself heading for a similar fate? 'Jim wanted to be like a shooting star; now you see him, now you don't, but for that brief moment he burns as the brightest star in the galaxy.' - Danny Sugerman, friend of Morrison. Is this line indicative of a death wish, much like Morrison?\n\r\nMotel, sprees, sprees and I'm singing - this is a definite allusion to LA Woman, where Morrison sings 'Motel, money, murder, madness'. Both money and murder have connections with the word spree - a spending spree and a killing spree are both commonly recognised terms, and both indicate a form of insanity or 'madness', crazy excess, going overboard. This line is the strongest connection between LA Woman and Gods & Monsters.\n\r\nFuck, yeah, give it to me\r\nThis is heaven, what I truly want \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she sounds like she is trying to convince herself of something, as though there is a gnawing  suspicion that something is still missing. She is taking on all of the excess LA can throw it her, and challenging to give more. Also, if LA is the land of Gods and monsters, then she feels like she is heaven when she has achieved everything she thinks it has to offer.\n\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innocence lost. \r\nInnocence lost. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is in keeping with the line \u00e2\u0080\u0098I was an angel\u00e2\u0080\u0099. She has been corrupted by the land of Gods and monsters.\n\r\nIn the land of gods and monsters, \r\nI was an angel, lookin' to get fucked hard. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 again, Del Rey suggests that she was an angel, innocent and na\u00c3\u00afve. However, she was looking for trouble and looking for fulfillment outside herself. She wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looking to \u00e2\u0080\u0098fuck hard\u00e2\u0080\u0099, she was looking to \u00e2\u0080\u0098get fucked hard\u00e2\u0080\u0099. This requires another person. Her happiness depends on an external factor, she is incomplete. This is in keeping with a lifestyle of fame \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she needs to feel loved by others.\n\r\nLike a groupie incognito posing as a real singer,\r\nLife imitates art \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this line seems to be autobiographical. Del Rey sees herself more as a groupie, following the famous ones rather than being a famous one herself. She cannot quite believe that the world has bought the lie that she is a true artist; she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel worthy or that she is one. She went to LA and was catapulted into this position, and any moment the rug will be pulled out from under her.\n\r\nYou got that medicine I need\r\nDope, shoot it up straight to the heart please \u00e2\u0080\u0093 now the medicine has changed from the previous reference. All that matters now is the drugs, and the dose is intense \u00e2\u0080\u0093 straight to the heart. She needs a greater and greater fix in order to survive.\n\r\nI don't really wanna know what's good for me \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she knows this lifestyle isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t good for her, and people have tried to tell her; perhaps her parents in her days of alcohol abuse? However, she is shutting that part of herself off, she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to face reality. The \n\r\nGod's dead, I said 'baby that's alright with me' \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This could be a reference to Nietzsche, who famously declared \u00e2\u0080\u0098God is dead.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Nietzsche was referring to the fact that the modern world has in many ways made God redundant. Could Del Rey be suggesting that she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need God as long as she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in LA and living the dream? She has replaced God with her lifestyle. Also, if this is the land of Gods and Monsters, and God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead, she has now entirely moved to the dark side of the lifestyle, only the monsters remain. Before she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get along with God, but he was still around. Now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entirely gone.\n\r\nNo one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna take my soul away,\r\nLiving like Jim Morrison.\r\nHeaded towards a fucked up holiday.\r\nMotel, sprees, sprees, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m singing,\r\nFuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I truly want\r\nIt's innocence lost. \r\nInnocence lost. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 see above for chorus.\n\r\nWhen you talk it's like a movie and you're making me crazy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who is she talking to here? Again the theme of movies is in keeping with LA and Hollywood. Like a movie implies an idyllic existence and has romantic connotations, which links back to the earlier image of seduction.\n\r\nCause life imitates art \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a repetition of an earlier line. She has become immersed in art and the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of LA.\n\r\nIf I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?\r\nYou tell me life isn't that hard. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she feels the pressure to conform to the expectations of her lifestyle, and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel worthy as she is. She is looking to be the best version of herself, but only superficially. The person she is speaking to tells her life isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that hard, again, a very simplistic view.\n\r\nNo one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna take my soul away,\r\nI'm living like Jim Morrison.\r\nHeaded towards a fucked up holiday.\r\nMotel, sprees, sprees, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m singing,\r\nFuck yeah, give it to me, this is heaven, what I truly want.\r\nIt's innocence lost.\r\nInnocence lost.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI think some of the lyrics in this song have a hint of sarcasm in them. Like when she sings, \"I was an angel lookin to get fcked hard.\" I think she is saying a lot of guys hit on her and kind of told her she was just asking for it. And when she sings, \"this is heaven, what I truly want,\" she is trying to convince herself that it is. and she finally gives in to the liquor and sex and what not. and I think when she sings, 'no one's gonna take my soul away,\" that was something someone said to convince her to give into sin.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\ni find this song quite enigmatic, but here i go with what i think about it. \ni think it all revolves in the lines \"its innocence lost, innocence lost\", the lyrics start saying that in the land of gods and monsters she was an angel living in the garden of evil. its about this girl, full of innocence and purity that lives in this evil place. she gets consumed by life there full of drugs, alcohol, sex and ends living 'like jim morrison'. she then realizes that god is 'dead' as she stopped being that innocent and pure 'angel' she had been. she also says that no one s gonna take my soul away because of her new lifestyle but shes so consumed by this world that she dosent care anymore.\n\nwell hope you like my point of view :) bye and thanks! realtruth.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nThis song, at least on the surface, is about the internal conflict many people face about the temptations or 'sin' of the world.  These include drugs, sex, and other typical things that come with fame (think sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll).  She takes these and sexualizes them in an analogy throughout several lines;\n\n\"fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly\"\n\nIn the chorus, she's kidding herself (or whoever the narrator is);\n\n\"No one's gonna take my soul away\" is her way of saying that despite all the things she does, she will still be that \"angel\", or at least she hopes she will.  However, by the end of the chorus, she's admitted the truth; all of this has taken away her innocence.\n\nAlso in the chorus, she mentions \"living like Jim Morrison\".  Jim Morrison's life was plagued by drug abuse and a lot of sex with groupies.  I believe when she says \"headed towards a fucked up holiday\", she is referring to the date of his death, July 3rd.  This is obviously right before the America's Independence Day, July 4th.  Both Morrison and Lana Del Rey are American, so this is appropriate.  This life she is living will one day lead to her death.\n\nThe religious theme throughout I'm not really sure about.  Gods and monsters could represent the seemingly prominent figures in the music industry, or other people in her surroundings.  God isn't painted as a caring one in this song, but one of destruction, wrath, and conflict with Lana.  She wants to think of herself as an angel among monsters, but she's really not that innocent.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nWhy does everyone have to argue over something that they nor no one knows the true meaning in behind? WHO CARES. Just because you voiced an opinion over another's and it is contrary to their's doesn't mean anything. Your opinion over another's does not mean you are MORE CORRECT.\n\nThe beauty in this song is that it can mean something so different to every person. THAT is what great songs are meant to do. Inspire. Create. Shake you up. Make you think. It should mean something different to every person who listens to it. To sit around and correct people on their interpretation is just silly. Even if you are/ may be right, fine. What did you get for it? A sense of accomplishment from someone \"out there you've never met\" commenting the same way you are that you don't even know??

If it were about being addicted to drugs, if you have the drugs you are needing then it's heaven to you at the time.

She has someone getting shot up in several of her older videos, I think. That being said, this is my favorite song on the new album.

It's basically a song about fame and that \"sex, drugs & rock and roll\" lifestyle. \n\n1\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0 Verse - \nI think here is lana saying \"I'm not a big deal\" it's like she doesn't valorize herself, she's just another singer on that big music industry and she thinks she has nothing that can oustand her from the other singers. So when someone gives her fame she can actually feel like she's good enough, so it becomes an addiction, like a drug that makes you feel good about yourself. \n\nChorus - \n\" No ones gonna take my soul away\". Well, she doesn't want to be a product ( like a lot of singers nowadays), she wants to live wild  and freely and \"innocence lost\" there's a comparasion with sex, like when you have sex for the first time and you actually see what is about, you lose a lot of ideas that you had and it turns out that the real deal is better than what you have thought, so she's basically saying that she now understands the world and she gets how it is to be famous, and that feels really good. \n\n2\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b0 Verse - \nShe's putting herself down again, she doesn't feel good enough to be a singer. \n\"I was an angel, lookin' to get fucked hard\" I love this, because it brings singers to a human level, we all think the famous guys are differente than us, it turns out they're not genderless angels, they're human and the shit, they have sex and stuff. Again she puts herself away from God, like it doesn't matter to her, because He doesn't care for her so what is His purpose? It's really amazing how she puts it in the song. \n\nBrigde - \nShe's saying ( to a guy I don't know) that when he talks, looks like a movie. Like he's really talented and she's not, so she thinks if she gets prettier they can be together. SDhe puts herself down again, like she's not on the level of those hollywood starts. \n\nTO SUM UP: It's basically Lana saying that she's not good enough to be a star, and that this isn't for her. She thinks she's just another poser of singer trying to get to the top and that everyone around here it better, they're Gods and monsters. I think she really makes us think about how we deal with famous people, like they're not human or something, and what I love the most about Lana is that she wants us to know that they're not, they feel insecure, and they feel bad just as we do, so for me that's the magic of this lyric.

Sung in the first person it could very well be autobiographical, but could also easily apply to anyone in the same position: seduced by success and encountering its dangers. For Lana or any young woman the dangers are even more inherent and have a sexual overtone. Lana clearly illustrates that she is a na\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afve, young woman tempted by success, but also becomes aware of the dangers on the path to success, but ultimately affirms that no matter the cost or danger of achieving success it is what she wants; and that what she discovers and experiences along the way is a \u00e2\u0080\u009closs of innocence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLana describes herself as an \u00e2\u0080\u009cangel\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Living in the garden of evil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a \u00e2\u0080\u009cland of gods and monsters\u00e2\u0080\u009d where her \u00e2\u0080\u009cinnocence (is) lost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She truly is an angel, young and na\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afve. \u00e2\u0080\u009cScrewed up, scared, doing anything that I needed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no wonder she \u00e2\u0080\u009cshines like a fiery beacon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A young attractive woman with great talent and wanting to succeed could be guided to success by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgods\u00e2\u0080\u009d within her industry. Producers, agents, and mentors who recognize her talent could certainly help her. But all too often, people in those positions could also take advantage of someone like Lana. These are the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonsters\u00e2\u0080\u009d who could user her for personal gain or pleasure. When Lana sings \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was an angel, lookin' to get fucked hard\u00e2\u0080\u009d there is a dual meaning: she is a na\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afve, young woman who lacks the experience to navigate the treacherous world of people, especially men, who could use her desire to attain fame and success for their own gain and pleasure; and, she is a na\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00afve, young woman in awe at the influential people who are helping her and possibly sexually attracted to them. \n\nIn light of the dangers that she confronts, she undoubtedly wants to attain her success at all cost. For Lana, the path to success is seductive and dangerous.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cFame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly. Put your hands on my waist, do it softly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Like a double edged sword, the seduction is tempting, but also wrought with danger. Is this Lover a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgod\u00e2\u0080\u009d or a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For many women this really hits home. The courtship of a new Lover undoubtedly highlights the duality of this situation. Is this new Lover a god with all the best intentions and truly admiring me or is he a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonster\u00e2\u0080\u009d telling me what I want to hear only to take advantage of me for his own pleasure. The temptation has a strong sexual overtone. She is \u00e2\u0080\u009clooking to get fucked hard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but in the end will she just get fucked over. In light of the potential danger, she proclaims, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFuck yeah, give it to me, this is heaven, what I truly want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor Lana the dangers of success don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just come from those who are willing to take advantage of her, they are also personal. They are the pitfalls of living a fast lifestyle, \u00e2\u0080\u009clike Jim Morrison,\u00e2\u0080\u009d who battled his own personal demons, exacerbated by fame and leading toward his early death on a holiday weekend, July 3rd 1971.

I have to say that this song is catchy and well produced, but after watching the video I found it a bit condescending and even a bit racist in its portrayal of the \"garden of evil\" with its imagery portraying societal degredation at the hands of non-white \"thugs\" (black and hispanic) surrounding the precious white angel Lana as she weaves through his urban landscape devoid of goodness.\n\nThe lyrics don't correspond to the imagery either as it implies that she wants to live like Jim Morrison. That line alone tells me that either her or the ghost writer know nothing about Jim Morrison's rather short stint as a rock star, but furthermore as an artist and poet.\n\nI do give her handlers credit for a well polished album, and I guess Lana has cultivated a huge following with wannabe youthful nihilists who have yet to figure out what being an adult is all about. I just think her message-heavy songs could infuse a bit more \"real world\" wisdom based on the autobiographical experience of Elizabeth Woodridge Grant.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_29": "\nsorry my favorite lana song i can relate in some sense...the gods and monsters are the gangsters. and drug lords and the innocence of a girl who gets exploited because of her innocence..in the land of godsand monsters I was an angel lookingto get FUCKED hard like a groupie in cognito posing as a real singer life imitates art ..you got that medicine I need dope shoot it straight to the heart please..its the lifestyle and part of that lifestyle. unfortunately is soul snatching \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_30": "\nOk hear me out! I'm not crazy nor do I think any of this is a bad thing. Also I love Lana more than anything! She is a queen. \r\nAnyway, this song symbolizes how Lana sold her soul to the devil. Ever wonder how she rose to fame so quickly and how her Born to Die album came out of no where and was such a masterpiece? She sold her soul to the devil as many artists do in order to attain fame in the music world.\n\r\n\"In the land of gods&monsters, I was an angel. Living in the garden of evil.\"\r\n-This line was written in her days prior to fame.\r\n--In the land of gods( superior people) and monsters (terrible people), Lana was an angel (a being of Light, wholesome, pure) living in the garden of evil (sinfully tempting place). \n\r\n\"Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed. Shining like a fiery beacon.\" \r\n-Lana was yearning for her career to finally take off. Some bad choices made her \"screwed up, scared and doing anything that I needed\" in order to make it by. She was \"shining like a fiery beacon\"a call for help --> like a warning fire on a beacon).\n\r\n\"You got that medicine I need\"\r\n- You (Satan) has the medicine (the thing to make it all better) that Lana needs in order to make it in the music industry. \n\r\n\"Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly\" \r\n-Lana is asking the devil to give her fame and liquor and love. These are the things she most wants and she wants them given to her slowly so she can take the time to truly feel and enjoy it all. \n\r\n\"Put your hands on my waist, do it softly.\" \r\n-Lana is telling the devil to grab her and take control of her but to be gentle. \n\r\n\"Me and god we don't get along, so now I sing.\"\r\n-Lana and the path god laid out for her is not what she wants. She doesn't get along with god but has now been able to get along with the devil by selling her soul to him to achieve fame through the art of singing.\n\r\n\"No one's gonna take my soul away, I'm living like Jim Morrison.\"\r\n-No person is going to take away what Lana truly is or decide what her fate will be. Instead, she chooses to live like Jim Morrison AKA selling her soul to the devil for the things she wants (Morrison sold his soul to the devil too for fame, power, and fortune at a young age in Los Angeles.\"\n\r\n\"Headed towards a fucked up holiday.\"\r\n-Lana is now on the path to a destructive end date. \n\r\n\"Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing,\"\r\n-motels (lifestyle of a singer always on the road staying at motels), sprees (drinking sprees, sex sprees, money sprees) while she's singing (doing what she wants to do).\n\r\n\"Fuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I truly want. It's innocence lost.\"\r\n-\"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is heaven, what I truly want (she's expressing extreme satisfaction with how the devil is paying her back for her soul, and using satire to refer to it as her form of heaven. Her innocence is gone and she is no longer that angel she once was.)\n\r\n\"In the land of gods&monsters, I was an angel, looking to get fucked hard. Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer. Life imitates art.\"\r\n-In the land of gods( superior people) and monsters (terrible people), Lana was an angel (a being of Light, wholesome, pure) looking for sex (perhaps she thought sex could get her noticed in the music industry) much like how groupies look for sex by pretending to be real singers when they're out-and-about in Hollywood. \"Life imitates art (what Lana is doing in her life is purely inspired and influenced from the different forms of art she's experienced).\n\r\n\"You got that medicine I need, dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart please.\"\r\n-once again, \"you\" (Satan) has the \"medicine\" (the thing to make it all better) that Lana needs in order to make it in the music industry. \"Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart please (Lana is craving the \"medicine\" and wants it given to her directly and immediately.)\n\r\n\"I don't really wanna know what's good for me\"\r\n- Lana doesn't care anymore about what's good or bad, she just wants her glory.\n\r\n\"God's dead, I said 'baby that's alright with me'.\" \r\n-the devil, now in complete control of Lana, tells her that god is no more and it's only the devil who is here. Lana replies that she's fine with it (now that of course she has the lifestyle she's always wanted).\n\r\n\"When you talk it's like a movie and you're making me crazy\"\r\n-Lana tells the devil that when he talks to her, she's completely entranced in him (much like a viewer of a movie) and it drives her crazy (she can't get enough of it).\n\r\n\"Cause life imitates art.\"\r\n-Lana is having these reactions to the devil in her life because of her experience through various forms of art. \n\r\n\"If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?\" \r\n-Lana is so drawn to what the devil has done for her that she is now trying to be the perfect woman for him so he can give her even more! (Sugar daddy? We all know Lana likes that concept)    ;)\n\r\n\"You tell me 'life isn't that hard'.\"\r\n-as I said just prior to this, Lana is so drawn to what the devil has done for her that she is trying to be perfect for him and be his baby so she can have anything she wants. She lost sight of the ability to get things on her own. She sees the devil as a \"sugar daddy.\" The devil replies to Lana that she doesn't need to be his baby and that she doesn't need to be any \r\nprettier because \"life isn't that hard.\" He gave her fame but he's telling her that she doesn't need EVERYTHING from him and that she can get some things in life on her own. Perhaps he doesn't care to help her any further...he is now the owner of her soul and that's all he cares about. \n\r\nThe end! \n\r\nLDR, forever <3\n\n\n", "comment_31": "\nAll of the comments so far on 'No ones gonna take my soul away' I disagree with.\n\nI have two opinions though on what it could mean, my first I think is the most likely sensible one..  'No ones going to take my soul away'  simply put FAME is everylasting depending on your level, people today still idolise, make videos, play music, dress up as people who have been dead for hundreds even thousands of years. Cleopatra anyone?   I cannot find the quote but Brad pitt playing Achilles in 'Troy' springs to mind, the speech he gives about death and fame... Basically with fame you never die, your average person who remembers them once they have died once family/friends have died out, if they havnt done anything noteworthy in their life they wont even be remembered in their own family let alone anywhere else.\nFame makes people immortal\n\nIn the past few years its become almost internet mainstream the whole 'illumanti' thing. Hundreds of singers have been asked in interviews now what they think about the whole 'illumanati' thing and whether they are part of it.  People are dedicating their lives spreading the word of the 'illumanati' that they are almost turning it into some kind of religion.. kind of ironic that the people so worried about it are the ones creating the whole illusion. Every new singer now that gets famous is accused of being a 'puppet' or 'part of' the 'illumanati'\n\n I think Lana is aware of this concept and is abit of a joke saying even if they could that nobody is taking her soul.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_32": "\nSuch a gorgeous song.\n\nTo me, it's about being trapped in a lifestyle or addicted to a person that you know is bad for you, but you can't stop.\n\n\"Fuck yeah, give it to me. This is heaven, what  I truly want\".... to me, this doesn't seem sarcastic. It seems like an admission-- what she SHOULD want, and perhaps presents to other people, is a healthy, functional relationship in a land of normalcy. What she really wants is intensity, Gods and Monsters, alcohol and this guy who doesn't treat her right.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_33": "\nI think it's about making a deal with the Illuminati for fame, not by selling her soul however; but by sacrificing her life at the age of 27. There is something called the 27 club or something like that, google it. It's about celebrities who have been sacrificed at the age of 27, but their deaths have been staged to look like drug overdoses, suicides etc.. including Amy Winehouse, Jim Morrison and more. \n\nBefore she starts singing it sounds like she's repeating LA (los angeles) aka city of angels, so the 'garden of evil' to me seems like it's LA or hollywood.  \n\n'Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed, Shining like a fiery beacon.'\nLike moth to a flame, they see a pretty girl with talent and slowly turn her into lana del rey. She agrees to the deal because they have what she needs..\n\n'You got that medicine I need;\nFame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly.'\n\n'Headed towards a fucked up holiday.' Her death date.\n\nShe said this was her last album, I wonder why..?\n\nJust my thoughts on the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_34": "\nyou can disagree with me all you like but it's true.\n\r\nJust think as if she's singing this for an other entity, other than God, what\r\ncomes to mind, is the other dark one, the filth, Satan himself.\r\nJust keep an open mind, and it all will shape right in front of you.\r\nThey are not hidden meanings any more, they are and have been out for quite a while now.\n\n\r\nany one wants more can check Florence and the machine, no light, no light.\r\nIts no more hidden, the meanings of pop culture, it's right in front of you.\n\r\nJust keep an open mind.
