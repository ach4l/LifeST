The single was released June 22, 2015.Some have wondered if this song is directed at Selena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off and on boyfriend Justin Bieber or her more recent professional (and personal?) partner Zedd.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI think the song pretty much speaks for itself, she just wants to look good for her partner, and wants to show them how proud she is to be there girlfriend. I don't think this song is about Bieber at all, yes they had a interesting on & off relationship but she is over him and has moved on...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song is strip club material.\n\nA stripper on a pole with this as her cabaret kind of has everything nailed as far as a strip club experience goes from a mans point of veiw...so interesting that it's a lass who sings it and deliberately innocently to add.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\n\"Leave this dress a mess on the floor\" verifies what Ali2522 said.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
