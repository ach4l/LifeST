{"comment_0": "\nOne of my favorite off of the album. Pretty self explanatory - not all \"good\" things are the same. This particular \"good thing\" was good because in the moment, it made Sam feel good. But, it's becoming bad because true feelings aren't being expressed, he thought the friend felt the same way - maybe the friend did, but didn't want to jump all the way..who knows. Seems like Sam gets led on way too much..damn jerks leading people on...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nIt's proof that when you hear that someone or something is too good to be true, it usually is.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nIncredible song. It's honestly one of my favorites that he's sung. I think he's trying to get across the idea of sometimes at the beginning of a relationship, things are good and nice and happy but after awhile the fire begins to dim and it's not 'good' or meaningful anymore. \n\nOr it could mean that things we think are good may not actually be that great. Like things that are coated in happiness and lies(like being a singer or actor) when in reality it's stressful and scary.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
