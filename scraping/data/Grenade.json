He asks why were her eyes open, but the only way he would know hers were open is if his were also open. Him saying that should have been the signal she was bad seems a little obsessive and almost threatening. I can almost hear the persona from the song cornering this woman and aggressively asking \"why were your eyes open?? why didn't you close your eyes??\"\n\r\nNext he says that all he ever wanted was for her to give him ALL of her love, and that's it. \"I just wanted you to love me unconditionally. Why couldn't you do that for me??\" \n\r\nThe chorus goes on to say he would do all of these things for this woman (intercepting a grenade, jumping in front of a train, getting shot in the head) and it's a little too obsessive. Imagine if you were to just start seeing someone and after two weeks s/he was already saying they would die for you and they don't want to live unless it's with you. Granted, we don't know exactly how long the characters have been together, but it's still a very unhealthy way to look at a relationship.\n\r\nSo really, to me, it sounds like this man came on too strong to this girl in the early part of the relationship and she felt uneasy and maybe that she was in danger, so she decided to stop seeing him. As a result, we hear the story of an extremely sick and obsessive man wondering why she couldn't feel the same way about him as he did about her.\n\n\n", "comment_2": "\nFirst I love this song and this video is soooo awesome. I wish they didn't give him that haircut though! \n\r\nThe song means the obvious but the video has lots of metaphors that I can't bypass because they put the lyrics' meaning on display. There is this guy who is very heart broken (suicidal) and the pain inside is the weight (piano) he drags around. This pain is weighing him down. As he is passing through this forsaken (poor neighborhood) road of heart ache he is alone. He encounters threats to his life- his own thoughts seem deadly, they are the tattooed thugs you see. They look dangerous and deadly and this being a metaphor for how his own thinking is trying to kill himself-threatening his life. His mind is telling him, die, kill oneself. He passes the thugs unharmed but frightened because his own thinking frightens him. Then when those thoughts subside the pity thoughts for the self starts this being the old man/hobo that runs at him and pointing at him mocks and laughs. You are an idiot how could you love her, she hates you and you want to kill yourself for that?\" Some times when you are in that kind of pain ( I have) you'll tell yourself \"ah you are fucking stupid, why do you feel this way?\" Or you'll say things like \" I cant believe you feel this numb, you are wasting away gosh you are an idiot!\" Next point cars and people ( a woman dressed in all black) pass him aware but uncaring or oblivious to him and his pain/weight. Then comes up to the house where the stupid bitch has her man whore. Here is all the things he is singing about, he would do anything for her, even look for her carrying the piano, thus, this and what follows sets the entire lyrics into place. He looks up and sees them-realizing there is no going back, he then lowers his eyes then his head. Right then deciding to end it. He drags away that piano, as the pain deepens and the weight (life) becomes unbearable-he can barely push the piano on such steep uphill climb- the weight is going to crush him if he doesn't hold it. And the moment of death appears when the nun and the Priest slowly pass looking. Religion and God seem significant when crossing that road. Flashing red lights means extreme danger, train crossing means crossing over to the other side, him and his pain/piano/weight are right on the tracks and faces the end. The reason why he has the piano on the tracks is that this whole time the piano wasn't a material thing outside of him, it was the pain inside him which can not be separated ( cannot be left outside the tracks) and it must die with him.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nAre you (expletive) kidding me?  People are impressed with these lyrics? LOL\n\r\n\"The chorus is fantastic.\" ROFL you are kidding me right?  \n\r\nTHIS is what the our dumbed down current/future generations find to be lyrically/emotionally poetic?  May god have mercy on us all.  Anybody who actually thinks these lyrics are emotional is even worse than those who can't even understand what the song means.  The fact that you understand the line \"I'd catch a grenade for  you\" means literally what it says, and associate \"fantastic\" with it, means you are a culturally bereft and intellectually stymied moron.  \n\r\nThe future sucks.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI haven't seen the video, but when I hear a song as unambiguous as this, I like to think of it in the situation of an \"unreliable narrator\" so they say.\r\nI'm reluctant to hate this woman he's singing about until I know the singer's trustworthy. The listener doesn't actually have any proof that this singer isn't a crazy stalker who pursues the woman desperately against her wishes.\r\nCertain lyrics, like \"why were they open\"...I can imagine that he forced a kiss on her and she's afraid to refuse him. Same with \"You said you loved me, you're a liar\", as she felt scared of him so said she loved him to appease him.\r\nThe fact that she wouldn't catch a grenade or jump in front of a train for the singer (as he would for her) becomes a lot more justifiable if this is some psychotic stranger who she just wants to leave her alone. \r\nWhen he says lines like how she'd watch him burn or smile and pull out the brakes of his car, that is a \"would scenario\" that he is telling us; we have nothing to go on that she did do this, and this is purely his speculation that she would be so cruel.\r\nSo I just think its interesting that, however plain and simple this song seems (while being amazing and emotional at the same time), it could represent something totally different if you look at it another way. \n\n\n", "comment_5": "\nThe meaning behind this song is rather straight forward. he threw his heart on his sleeve and she took it for granted. she is thought of as hellish at one point in the song \"Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where you're from.\" basically he wants her love and would do anything for her but she doesn't care.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI saw this video of him dragging the piano uphill and singing about how he would \"take a granade for ya\". How his love was so great that he would sacrifice himself for this girl. I wonder if Bruno Mars saw the Christian the symbolic nature of the video and if not, did anyone else see it.... I know saw it and immediately thought of Christ dragging the cross uphill to make the ultimate sacrifice for my sins and the world. At one point in the video, he is harrassed by a street gang and ridiculed and I thought of Christ, again. How He humbled Himself to ordinary men when He could have stopped it at any time. He went through it all and died for us so that we may live through Him. Most will definitely see it as a love song for a girl while I see IN it a love song for the world. Who would have thunk it?

In a purely *metaphorical* sense, we're all willing to do that to some extent, and it might be reasonable to expect some minimum level of devotion from your partner, but grenade-catching? Head-knifing? A bullet through the brain? D:\n\nTo be prepared to literally *mutilate* yourself is not healthy (unless it's in the heat of a life-or-death situation perhaps, but even then I probably wouldn't blame a person for not going so far). To *expect* that same kind of willingness from your partner is disturbingly unhinged. To try to send a *guilt trip* over the failure to share these gleeful inclinations to self-harm is ample cause to put a lot of distance between oneself and such a person, imo.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nI love this song.

Anyway in the video he is dragging a heavy piano which could represent jesus carrying the cross, you have the gang members who shout out him and he doesn't argue back but just keeps walking and accepts it. Thats what happend with Jesus apart from it wasnt gang members lol. He meets other people on the way but noone helps him. Then there is priest and the end before the the train tracks which could be the end of his life. As for the lyrics it's simular to how jesus died for us but we take it for granted and the line: 'Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb' could either symbolise how we talk about religion taking names in vain etc.. or the pain that Jesus went through coming close to the end he just looked numb, didn't let the pain show and the line  'Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where you're from' Could mean that we are following the devils way and giving in. and so on.
