{"comment_0": "\nwhat part does the brahma bull play in the song? I always assumed it was Georgia Southern's mascot.\r\nAfter all, you have references to the University of Georgia (the Bulldogs) and George Tech (Yellowjackets)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis is a true story: Greta hippie-looking, kinda groovy  bartender in Athens, waaaaay back in the day. I think Jojo used to date her. She had an episode where an intruder tried to break into her house one night...she was alone and only had her dog to protect her. Pissed off (In a fighting mood) at the intruder (who attempted to climb in through her bedroom window after \"pawing\" at the front door and finding it locked), she sicked her dog on him. The dog mauled the intruder's face, leaving him hospitalized. Greta was ticketed and got into trouble for the incident by her landlord. Her gun was confiscated after the incident.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nHuh, I knew she was a bartender at the Nowhere bar & now works at Browncat, but I'd never heard that story.  I assumed the \"gun\" was a bar gun (which dispenses soda), silent hurricane was a hurricane (the new orleans drink), and the dogs and yellowjackets were duelling UGA & Gtech fans...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI have heard the bartender story, but never to that detail.  Thanks.\n\r\nThis song has always been likened to environmental issues.  That mother nature (greta) is getting mad abot the state of the earth, and is fighting back.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
