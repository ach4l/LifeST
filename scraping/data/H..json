{"comment_0": "\nOkay guys, I'm pretty positive on this meaning.  This isn't my own interpretation, therefore I do not take credit for it, but I do agree with it.\r\n  Okay, about the meaning from toolshed.down.net... it's partly true, but not completely.  Ya ever wonder why they just DO NOT play that song on tour, like hardly at all, even though it's so popular?  Well it's because this song has a special meaning to Maynard.\r\n    Devo Keenan, his son, has the middle name of H... not anything extra... just H.  The song isn't about any person at all, it's about his son... think about the song.  Maynard had a bad relationship with his father when he was young, constantly being abused.  Even though he loves Devo, sometimes he has a problem, and wants to hurt him.  He gets it from his father... and it causes him to want to lash out at his wife and his child. that's why when he says they're \"void of hate, but killing him just the same\"... he means that Devo loves him, but he's still hurting Maynard because of Maynard's past.... \r\n  When he talks about \"snake behind me hisses, what my damage could have been\", he's talkin about how what his father did to him wants to resurge through him and onto Devo.  then the next verse \"my blood before me begs me, open up my heart again\"... he's sayin that the blood before him (his children, future grandchildren, etc.) is begging him to forget the past and start over... Infer the rest of the song for yourself.  I think this is the best explanation possible.  Thanks for botherin to read this.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nMost say this song is about his son, name being Devo H.

But I think that's not exactly about the fear to replicate upon his own son the violence that he himself has suffered from his father.\r\nI think that the lyric involves directly or indirectly 4 charachters:\r\nMaynard : who is the center of an inner conflict.\r\nThe snake : Personification of Maynard's hate, rage, and revenge feelings for what he suffered when he was a child\r\nMaynard's father \r\nMaynard's son.\r\nKeeping these in mind, all we have to do is understand sentence by sentence whom the song is referring to.\n\r\n>>> \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's coming through is alive. What's holding up is a mirror.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nMaynard's son lead Maynard to look at himself and think again about his sad childhood.\n\r\n>>> \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what's singing songs is a snake. Looking to turn my piss to wine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThe snake is the temptation to indulge in hate and resentment, making them look like pleasant feelings (piss to wine).\n\r\n>>> \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey're both totally void of hate, But killing me just the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThat's referred to the snake and the father.\n\r\n>>> The snake behind me hisses What my damage could have done. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\n\r\nThat's ambiguois. I think the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdamage\u00e2\u0080\u009d could be the mark of the father on Maynard, the fact that his personality changed in worst because he became full of hate, resentment, etc.\n\r\n>>> My blood before me begs me Open up my heart again.\n\r\nBut his inner voice (me) and his son (my blood) beg him to not let his father, the hate and resentment win, but to open his heart instead.\n\r\n>>> And I feel this coming over like a storm again. Considerately.\n\r\nAll the fear, inner conflicts, rage, etc. that he experienced in the past as his father came to beat him are happening once again in his mind.\n\r\n>>> Venomous voice, tempts me, Drains me, bleeds me. Leaves me cracked and empty. Drags me down like some sweet gravity.\n\r\nAs above the snake is the temptation to indulge in anger and bad feelings instead of fighting them.\n\r\n>>>  I am too connected to you. To slip away, fade away. Days away I still feel you. Touching me, changing me. Considerately killing me.\n\r\nThat's the climax of the inner fight: Maynard is scared that the past hurted him to deeply and too much, so that's impossible for him to change, to forget.\n\r\n>>> Without the skin here, Beneath the storm. Under these tears now, The walls came down. And as the snake is drowned And as I look in his eyes, My fear begins to fade Recalling all of those times. I could have cried then. I should have cried then. (\u00e2\u0080\u00a6) I have died and will die. It's all right. (I don't mind)\n\r\nAt the end Maynard won the fight, he is reborn: all the anger that surrond him like walls are gone, the snake that tempted him is gone.  He look in his son's eyes in order to find the strenght to change and let the good feelings win. But even if he won this fight he can't erase what happened: he still recall those days, he still remember all the bad feelings he had to hide, all the time he wanted to cry, all the time that he died inside. And every time he will remember what happened he will die inside once again.\n\r\nAfter all this song is pretty similar to \u00e2\u0080\u009cReflection\u00e2\u0080\u009d: both describes an inner fight against bad feelings (anger and resentment / selfishness and sloth), and both ends up with the win of the good side of the soul.

He is tempted (by the snake, his father, with whom he had an abusive relationship) to distance himself from this child. He realizes, however, that his former relationship with his father is a thing of the past, and he has the opportunity to kill the tendencies he could have inherited from his father by opening his heart and being vulnerable in having a loving relationship with his child.

They are his son, who he is speaking to and a part of himself that isn't ready to be a father.\n\nHe is having a conflict between the part of him that's ready to be a father and the one that's not (the snake). He's been having it since he found out he was going to have a child. \n\nBeneath the storm is referencing his final \"break down\" after his son is born. He's realizing and understanding the fearful part of himself is the problem.

Based on Maynards previous interviews, the H stands for devo's middle name, as others have already stated.\r\nThe entire song is loaded with imagery. But everything has a meaning, no matter how simple. My interpretation is based on something maynard said in concert in '96 to introduce this song.\r\nStraight from wikipedia:\r\n \"Any of you ever seen those old Warner Bros. cartoons? Sometimes there's that one where the guy is trying to make a decision, and he's got an angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other. Seems pretty obvious, right? The angel is trying to give him good advice while the devil is trying to get him to do what's bad for him. It's not always that simple, though. A lot of times they're not really angels or devils, but friends giving you advice, looking out for your best interest but not really understanding what's going to be best for you. So it kind of comes down to you. You have to make the decision yourself. This song is called 'H.'\r\n-MJK himself\r\nSo using that quote as a framework, let's break down the song in the classic line by line style.\n\n\n\r\n\"What's coming through is alive\r\nWhat's holding up is a mirror\r\nBut what's singing songs is a snake\r\nLooking to turn this piss to wine\"\n\r\nThis is very important. These first four lines are describing each side of his shoulder: one side is a mirror that's alive, a reflection of himself- in my opinion, it makes sense that that's devo: a living mirror of maynard. The other side is a snake that is looking to turn his piss into wine, i.e. a somewhat more nefarious side that's trying to turn a bad situation good.\n\r\n\"They're both totally void of hate\r\nBut killing me just the same\"\n\r\nBut we have to remember what maynard says, neither side is inherently good or bad, they both care about maynard. According to this line, theyre also simultaneously doing him harm.\n\r\n\"The snake behind me hisses\r\nWhat my damage could have been\r\nMy blood before me begs me\r\nOpen up my heart again\"\n\r\nSo the snake is whispering what his damage could have been: how badly he could be hurt. This is integral to my theory of who or what the snake represents.\r\nIn my mind, its not his abuser, but rather, his defense mechanism against abuse. All those repressed feelings of hate and angst from being abused as a young boy in ohio created a snake-like defense mechanism in maynard that whispers at him whenever he gets too close to someone, reminding him of the danger, the possible damage.\r\nOn the opposite side is his blood before him- his son- begging him to open up his heart and emotionally connect- which is the exact thing the snake is telling him NOT to do. Ironic.\n\r\n\"And I feel this coming over like a storm again\r\nConsiderately\"\n\r\nSo whenever his son and wife or anyone else is tugging at him to open up emotionally, that snake is whispering and hissing at maynard, and he feels all those feelings from the past well up and start killing him inside: condsiderately, mind you.\n\r\n\"Venomous voice, tempts me\r\nDrains me, bleeds me\r\nLeaves me cracked and empty\r\nDrags me down like some sweet gravity\"\n\r\nThe snake is tempting him, draining him, dragging him down: encouraging him to draw inside and away from everyone else. Cut himself off to keep from being hurt.\n\r\n\"I am too connected to you to\r\nSlip away, to fade away\r\nDays away I still feel you\r\nTouching me, changing me\r\nAnd considerately killing me\"\n\r\nBut at the same time he knows that he's too connected to his family so slip away, and so he won't leave them. But being around them is still killing him inside, because it reminds him of his own abuse.\n\r\n\"Without the skin\r\nBeneath the storm\r\nUnder these tears\r\nThe walls came down\"\n\r\nAs he's being battered around by the storm of repressed feelings seeping out of his subconscious, he finally finds the strength inside to make his own decision and brings the emotional walls down.\n\r\n\"And the snake is drowned and\r\nAs I look in his eyes\r\nMy fear begins to fade\r\nRecalling all of those times\r\nI could have cried then\r\nI should have cried then\r\nAnd as the walls come down and\r\nAs I look in your eyes\r\nMy fear begins to fade\r\nRecalling all of the times\r\nI have died And will die\r\nIt's all right I don't mind\"\n\r\nThe metaphorical storm of emotions floods out into this dreamscape and the snake- the defense mechanism that he had long since outgrown- is drowned in the torrent. As he looks in it's eyes, his fear of emotional commitment fades. He remembers the times he should have cried- the times he should have been emotionally available for his family, and uses that regret to break down his walls. As he looks in his family's eyes, he remembers all the times he almost died from the abuse of his biological father, and makes his peace with it. He no longer minds.\n\r\nI am too connected to you to\r\nSlip away, to fade away\r\nDays away I still feel you\r\nTouching me, changing me\r\nAnd considerately killing me\n\r\nSo he knows the truth- that he is too connected to the ones he loves to allow them to slip away because of his own past.\n\n\n\n\r\nThat's my opinion, anyway.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nThe struggle between good and evil in all of all.

For me this song is about love. Hear me out... I used to constantly be betrayed and hurt at the hands of people I really cared about and I built a shield.

I held out for about 6 months, then I thought for a olng time about it, and the period that I was thinking, is like the period that the song takes place. The snake is the pain from the past and the shield that I put up, the blood before me is the desire to let go, to live again. Finally, I looked in her eyes and let go. I just gave up my shield, made myself vurnerable again. She had to do the same thing, and it worked out.

Although the song may be for his son, his son's presence/person was not intended to be found in the lyrics.  This song, though, is indeed about the treacherous relationship Maynard endured with this abusive stepfather growing up.  It also happens that Maynard's original middle name was Hubert and his son's H.  The song is struggle between the past and the present, a father-son relationship.  The snake symbolizes the residual presence of Maynard's stepfather and the other person mentioned in the song symbolizes the Maynard's undaunted, unadulterated person.  When Maynards says:\r\nWhat's holding up is a mirror \r\nBut what's singing songs is a snake \r\nhe is refering to his own person when mentioning the mirror and is refering to his stepfathers residual presence in himself when he refers to the singing snake.\r\nAhh....clever Maynard, clever.  But Maynard is even more clever than first thought.  A true TOOL fan knows the multiple levels on which Maynard always wrote his songs...the first and foremost being Biblical Allusions...usually relating to terrible times in his own life...Maynard trying to reveal the hypocracy of what he grew up knowing as the Chistian Baptist faith.  As we all know, Maynard was raised in a strict Baptist household growing up, but was subject to horrible sexual, verbal, and physical abuse from his stepfather...the hypocratical betrayer of his own message of love and diligence.  Maynard grew up not trusting Christianity, Baptist Christianity in particular, and even found evil and hypocracy in its God, the symbol of its values, Jesus Christ.  I believe Maynard makes a symbolic reference.  The snake symbolizes something evil, yet something that supposed to come off as being righteous, being loving...the snake symbolizes Jesus Christ, who Maynard thought to be the devil at the time and in this song.  Anyone who swears will understand the next bit.  When a man swears using the Lords name in vein, he sometimes says, \"Jesus H. Christ\".....ahh yes!!--the glorius connections is made.  This view of Jesus parallels the his view of his stepfather, someone who comes off loving but who betrays you at the most intimate level.  When refering to H., I believe Maynard is refering to that terrible time when that was his middle initial, and I believe that he is also refering to the negatively connotated so-called middle intitial of Christ.  He is afterall drawing parallels between the two things, that time in his life and that message in his life.  To futher provide evidence supporting the Biblical Allusion, he says:\r\nBut what's singing songs is a snake \r\nLooking to turn this piss to wine\r\nwhich shows real animosity towards Jesus Christ, \"turning this piss to wine.\"  You see the symbolic reference of the snake being the devil/his stepfather as well:\r\nThe snake behind [in the past now] me hisses \r\nWhat my damage could have been [if he were to be like his stepfather]\r\nhe also says:\r\nVenomous voice [Satan's/stepfather], tempts me, \r\nDrains me, bleeds me, \r\nLeaves me cracked and empty \r\nDrags me down like some sweet gravity\r\nall of these references are past and done with but still effect him immensly even today.\r\nThis explanation of H., I believe, is more thorough than what was previously stated.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_63": "\nhow do you know that maynard's son's middle name is H?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_64": "\num, i think most everyone's intrerpretations are correct and extremely intelligent, but how do you know about Maynard being abused as a child and how do you know that he sometimes thinks about abusing his son-or was that just a theory?

The song isn't about any person at all, it's about his son... think about the song. Maynard had a bad relationship with his father when he was young, constantly being abused. Even though he loves Devo, sometimes he has a problem, and wants to hurt him. He gets it from his father... and it causes him to want to lash out at his wife and his child. that's why when he says they're \"void of hate, but killing him just the same\"... he means that Devo loves him, but he's still hurting Maynard because of Maynard's past.... \r\nWhen he talks about \"snake behind me hisses, what my damage could have been\", he's talkin about how what his father did to him wants to resurge through him and onto Devo. then the next verse \"my blood before me begs me, open up my heart again\"... he's sayin that the blood before him (his children, future grandchildren, etc.) is begging him to forget the past and start over...

As Maynard is about to start the song, he talks about the old Warner Bros Cartoons. He recounts when the angel and the devil are on each shoulder and tell him to make a decision. Maynard says it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a no-brainer, as the angel obviously has the right decision. \r\n Maynard then snaps back to reality and reminds us that life isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always that easy, and that people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinions and suggestions aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always right or true, so ultimately you should make the decision for yourself. \n\r\nSo what if the two theories were combined. Maybe, Maynard was advised to raise his child with some issue, or maybe to have him at all. Ultimately, the song is about making choices for yourself, and how Maynard realised this, and it turned out for the better.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_96": "\nthis song is amazing..i never really got into tool or apc much before, but lately in the past few days, they are all i can listen to. im so interested in their music and maynard. its almost like i cant pry myself from it all.

It's a constant battle inside, constantly pushing down the rage and  making myself be a good mom. I get better at it every day but it's not easy and there are days when I get the urge to sneak away and never look back because some small part of me tells me I never should have had kids and I might have made a mistake. But then the depressed trapped feelings go away and I know that my children are better off with me and I know that they are worth the constant struggle inside to be a good parent. I know that having well adjusted, healthy, happy children is worth the battle to be a better mother, then my mother was to me. \n\r\nIt's very hard to a parent when your own childhood was traumatic, the very act of parenting can be daily reminder of how fucked up things use to be when you were a child.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_127": "\nI know everyone says Maynard's son's middle name is H. and that is all fine and good. But I really can't help feeling it's about heroin. After the APC song \"Weak and Powerless\" about H, I've always suspected Maynard has done it because he describes it so accurately and vividly. And this song is no different. It conveys the same idea and feeling that are assosciated with heroin. The best connection I make is with the idea that you always feel the heroin no matter how long it has been. At least I would say there is a double meaning here. Because the official title of the song is a lower case h with a period. So this doesn't seem to fully coordinate with a name which would be capitalized. Whereas, something like heroin wouldn't require capitalization. So to review, heroin is clearly prevalent to Maynard through \"Weak and Powerless\", \"h.\" is clearly conveying the feeling of heroin, and the title remains ambiguous.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_128": "\nand if maynard has said it is about \"good\" and \"evil\" and \"love\" and \"relationships\" all of these terms apply to heroin as well.

It could be about a past love, Maynard's son, and it does point to heroin. \n\r\nWith the latter, I don't think it is about that because from what I've known, Maynard's never been addicted to drugs. When he wrote \"Weak and Powerless\" he said in an interview that it was difficult to write for him since he hasn't been addicted to drugs. He had to write that song using the experiences of people he knew. Not his own. Still, if that's what it means to you and it helps you with you own life, that's great.\n\r\nI think the meaning about his son makes the most since, but I can't relate to it as easily as others. That's why I found a different meaning: temptation.\n\r\nIt's quite obvious that the snake is meant to symbolize temptation (a reference to Genesis, as been's stated before). The snake makes promises (\"turning piss into wine\") which sound good, but they are bad for you.\n\r\nThe blood before him could mean his family trying to help him out and steer him on the right path.

Maynard uses contrasting imagery of 'piss' and 'wine' in the first verse, showing how to him heroin is both a filthy liquid and at the same time one that is both sweet and precious. 'both totally void of hate' - hypodermics?? im not sure about that one, 'killing me just the same' should be obvious though.\n\r\n'My blood before me begs me, Open up my heart again' - this again is easily linked to shooting up, but the language used, specifically the word 'beg' and the phrase 'tempts me' in the line before suggests that Maynard is trying to fight against the urge to use heroin\n\r\nthe analysis can go on... 'leaves me cracked and empty' - the comedown is obviously harsh with a drug like heroin. 'drags me down like some sweet gravity' - we've all seen trainspotting right? that bit where ewan mcgregor shoots up and seems to sink into the floor? might be something similar..\n\r\n'too connected to you to slip away' - shows how maynard feels he is dependent on the drug and cannot  get off it.\r\n'days away i feel you touching me' - perhaps a reference to the lasting effects of heroin\n\n\r\nand this is the bit that could make or break this interpretation\n\r\n'i feel this coming over like a storm again.'\r\nif we take 'storm' here to mean the hit you recieve from heroin, then this rolls into the next stanza:\n\r\n'without the skin\r\nbeneath the storm\r\nunder these tears\r\nthe walls came down'\n\r\nif you switch the words 'without' and 'beneath' around, and already take storm to mean a hit from heroin, we can interpret the walls coming down to mean the horrible experience of going 'cold turkey' when you're addicted to smack (without the storm)\n\r\nanyways i might be totally wrong, but i think the references are too easy to spot and the links too easy to make for this to be totally unintentional.. plus as someone already mentioned heroin does indeed begin with the letter 'H'.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_242": "\nI cried when I heard this song, for me, it's about  someone who is in love with someone else, but the other person is nothing but harm to you, whether they realize it or not.

You just wish they would have seen it in themselves.All the times you \"should have cried\" you didnt you just kept putting up with it.Wanting to help them.They are too full of themselves to care.(that is the snake to me).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_244": "\nI'll say again, this isn't about Heroin. Mild experience with Tool will show you that, just as in Stinkfist and many other songs, you can either lose meaning and take it literally, or take it metaphorically and gain a deeper understanding of the lyrics. Literally, yes, it could be interpretated as being about Heroin; but anyone can take a Tool song literally, but it's far more enjoyable if you derive your own metaphorical meanings to the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_245": "\nTo me this song is about the R-complex, or the reptilian part of the human brain.  The R-complex developed first in reptiles(hence the name) along the course of evolution and still exists in the human being.  The line \"the snake behind me hisses\" points to the past, or earlier stages of evolution - \"what my damage could have been\" suggests the fact that the R-complex is more inclined to animalistic behaviors.  \"My blood before me begs me, open up my heart again\" strongly suggests reaching into the neocortex to overcome our primitive behavior, keeping in mind that we are on an evolutionary course, so keep the future in mind.\n\r\nThe way he talks of drowning the snake is more evidence of this meaning.\n\r\n\"Recalling all of the times I have died and will die\" suggests to me the stages of evolution.  Keep in mind the early forms of human life are now extinct.  Who's to say that our current state of existence is not permanent and will be replaced by the next stage, in a sense die.\n\r\nSo in effect this song is about abandoning our more instinctual tendencies to embrace rather a more heart felt state of being, so that we can usher in the next stage of evolution.  That stage is more of a higher consciousness state of being.\n\r\nAs a side note I like to think most of Maynard's lyrics are more encompassing to the human species, rather than just a personal meaning to Maynard.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_246": "\nYou guys are way over-analyzing this.

Its killing him while sending him to a euphoric place.  you see the damage and death but you cannot turn away.  \"i am too connected to you, to slip away, fade away..Days away I still feel you touching me, changing me, and considerately killing me\" you know whats in store, you feel it coming over you \"like a storm again\" but you cannot stop.

I think that the oligarchic dictatorial governments that the world has had for the last 3000 years has an impact on the family dictatorship at home of parents verbally and morally abusing their children. So in this case parents are like the oppressive governments and the children are the working class. However I want to say something related to this, i admit that I have had many verbal fights with my father, and my father has had sometimes an oppressive dictatorial way of treating me and my brothers and sisters. But I think that this is ingrained in the capitalist system.\n\r\nI think that the only solution for this is a mental, spiritual, socialist, christian revolution in this world(Not the Republican Party type of christianity), i mean the liberating socialist-christianity.\n\r\nAnd many simplistic people in this world are very wrong in blaming all their personal failures in life on Obama and the capitalist ruling class. But the dictatorial abusive parenting is also to blame. However that dictatorial way of treating children is really rooted in the capitalist oligarchic dictatorial political system we have in USA and in many many other nations.\n\r\nOnly a political revolution toward workers socialism can be a solution for this male-supremacist system and dictatorial system of abusive parents, abusive husbands, abusive teachers, abusive institutions etc.\n\r\nthanks\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_295": "\nFor those that got angry at the guy commenting how he thought it was about heroin, saying \" i think this song is deeper than that\" and other things..

It's the thing that has the venomous voice that tempts you and then drains you, bleeds you and leaves you cracked and empty.

Most if not all cultures have defined their lives through religion. Knowing Maynard's thoughts on religion i think the meaning is really deep. \n\nI think the first line is: \"What's coming through is a lie. not \"alive.\" \"What's holding up is a mirror.\" This is to say that we ourselves create the reality of this world and that everything you see id but a refection of your and everyone elses thoughts. This is about how no matter what the religion or thoughts about a god and a devil it's a lie cause we cannot define what life and existence really is. We try through religion to give us purpose thusly defining our existence. \n\nWhen he says that they're both void of hate and killing me just the same. He's talking about god and the devil not really hating us but that for each we must die. Religious debate aside there are those who feel the devil also loved us and that by showing eve the way to a higher level of consciousness so that we aren't simple monkeys like it seems god wanted us to be.\n\nWhen he says that he feels it coming over like a storm he's talking about dying and that no matter what the form \"change the way, I still feel you\" he still feels the existence of what we would call god. but not split up into good and evil. when he speaks about being without the skin here, beneath the storm hes talking about that place when you die. the storm is the storm of life and all the things that go on in it. Time there has no bounds, the walls of existence itself come down, and he is able to see his past lives.\n\nHe talks about when the snake is dry, (when this life is over.) The snake of life behind him hisses what his life could have been. And his blood, his flesh begging to open his heart and live again. \n\nAs the snake is dry, There's a look in his (god) eyes, my fear begins to fade, recalling all of the times he dies. He thinks about times where he could have cried about dying that way. and the times when he should have cried about his death. And as he comes to realize the true nature of existence he doesn't mind dying again. I visualize crazy death scenes in the guitar solo part where he thinks about the hundreds of times he's lived and died. at the end he starts again saying that \"I sense someone killing me.\" He starts again in a new form.\nChange the way, I still feel you touching me, changing me.\n\nThat's just my personal interpretation..\nBig Tool fan and probably the only black guy at their concerts. lol....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_299": "\nFolks - not to diminish the value of your speculation about his son and this and that, but I must tell you that someone who has been up to .5gr of H + .2gr of Ck in a single shot 3 times a day the meaning of the song is beyond transparent.

When someone is abused as a child they will suppress the emotional pain and feel another emotion instead, in my case anger.  But you can't bury your emotions forever (\"I am too connected to you to slip away, fade away\") so when that emotional tank is full the dam breaks and it all comes pouring out and you feel months of emotional pain condensed into a very short period, in which you flash back to painful periods where you should've felt your feelings.  The snake is the pain he's carrying around, the song is about the mixed feeling of the intense agony of feeling the outpouring of emotional pain with the sense of relief at being able to feel with a part of you that has been numb for so long and being able to unburden yourself, thus \"considerately killing me\".  \"And as the snake is drowned, and as I look in his eyes my fear begins to fade, recalling all of the times I could have cried then... I should have cried then, and as the walls come down and as I look in your eyes my fear begins to fade, recalling all of the times I have died, and will die - it's alright, I don't mind.\"  As someone who experienced this many times growing up it is a profoundly beautiful and poetic (not to mention deep and thoughtful) description of the whole experience.\n\r\nThough like with all art, any meaning you get out of it through other interpretations is still meaningful - but this describes the emotional disorder in question so well and so specifically that it's hard to subscribe to the other interpretations I've read.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_308": "\nOMG~ lol of corse this is an embarrassingly late moment of 'oooohhhh sshiiiit.....

However, songs mean different things to different people and move us each in a unique ways.  I believe it could very well be about heroin addiction, but I think it can also be about co-dependency in relationships. \n\n Like when someone is so attached to someone since they feel such emptiness, but they become very distressed when they sense distance (i.e. I am too connected to you to slip away fade away).  I think the beginning part about temptation is when someone is tempted into a relationship that may be toxic, but they proceed anyway, becoming addicted to the person who fills a void for them.  They try to keep their feelings in check (hence, \"Days away I still feel you touching me, changing me.  Considerately killing me\").  The person knows they are in over their head and that their emotions are being controlled by their attachment to someone.  It is killing them, but they choose to bear with the pain. They are empty, and afraid; not knowing what else to do, so they hold on, and the cycle continues.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_314": "\n The lyrics of this song always made me think of Jesus in the desert, being tempted by Satan, and the resolution  that Jesus  faced while on the cross. The title of the song, \"H\" was something that I did not understand.   Looking back I probably got it all wrong, it probably has more to do with his personal relationship with his child, or  perhaps a poetic expression about heroin addiction.   Either way, all of us identify with the feelings expressed in our own personal way .\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_315": "\nWell, I have been listening to this song and album since I was 14, I am now 32 and believe you me I have changed my opinion of this song many times depending on the knowledge and experience I have gained throughout my years.\n\nI believe it IS about his abusive past and his son BUT, I believe it is also coming from a more spiritually enlightened point of view. The \"snake\" he refers to is indeed from his Stepfather but is NOT his stepfather. Let me explain further.\n\nMaynard obviously sold his soul to the Devil to make this record, as he bluntly expresses in \"Hooker with a penis\" on selling your soul the truth of reality is reveled to you by a God (not Lord God) and you start to understand things that you never knew before, like the fact that a demon can travel through your family line and cause abuse, suicide, mental illness etc passing down through your family tie's, this can happen if a rule is severely broken, a sin (Lord Gods Law) .\n\nMaynard knows this because of what he bought into, eyes opened and truths reveled. So, with this extensive knowledge he is very much afraid of the snake (Demon) that influenced his step Dad as it could possibly influence himself, and therefore his son and so on. This happens in a spiritual realm, when you are abused spiritually, your wounds are opened to the abuser. \n\nIf you really feel and listen to what this album is about, you know it's not about just the physical realm but the hidden ones he has dabbled in.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_316": "\nI absolutely love to Tool, but I am sure there are bigger fans out there that follow along with what the members of the band are doing in their personal life .....etc \r\nI see some people are saying that this song has something to do with Maynard son, and maybe it does? \r\nI'm more apt to believe however, that the song is about Heroin..... and if it isn't it should be.......... the lyrics match perfectly ......\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_317": "\nThe Fall of Man\n\n1 What's coming through is alive.\n2 What's holding up is a mirror.\n3 But what's singing songs is a snake, it is,\n4 Looking to turn my piss to wine.\n5 They're both totally void of hate, and,\n6 Killing me just the same.\n\n1/2 Whats appearing is \"alive\" and has a mirroring effect\n(Made in God's image)\n\n3  The snake (Satan/Temptation) is tempting and alluring.

Inviting and coaxing with flattering words and with the power of an ancient muse/siren. The temptation to learn and have wisdom and free will has become enticing\n\n4\n The snake has the ability to produce mirages and illusions. Offering to provide Eve/Adam with knowledge and the power of free-will \n\n5\n Both God and Satan are void of intentional hate and ill will. Both wish to make Adam/Eve in their image.\n\n6 However, both Deities have condemned the two. (a)The eating of the apple provided them additional knowledge, but it also gave them the ability to conjure negative and destructive concepts such as shame and evil. (b)This act of rebellion (free thinking/free will) eventually leads to their expulsion, manual labor and pain in childbirth.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1 The snake behind me hisses,\n2 What my damage could have been.\n3 My blood before me begs me,\n4 Open up my heart again.\n\n1 The tempter/temptress is no longer singing a lovely melody of false, it is now a demand. \n2 The narrator is presented with the \"damage\" of not eating of the Tree of Knowledge; bliss,ignorance, complacency,etc.\n3/4  Adam's blood (rib/Eve) begs Him to also partake of the forbidden fruit. The pomegranate is the passion fruit, also called the food of love. The pomegranate is believed by many to be the true forbidden fruit, not the apple. This fruit stains that are similar to blood stains.\n(Still you pray, you never stray\n. Never taste of the fruit\n)\n(You never thought to question why/\"Judith\")\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd I feel this coming over like a storm again, considerately...\n\n1 Having been tempted the consideration (considerately) to gain additional knowledge, to think for one's self, and the overall temptation in general has led Adam/Eve to consider the possibilities and weigh the decisions (brainstorm) (As below, so above and beyond, I imagine\nDrawn beyond the lines of reason\n. Push the envelope, watch it bend/There is so much more\nAnd beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities\n/\"Lateralus). This could be the Serpent tempting Eve or Eve tempting Adam.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1 Venomous voice tempts me,\n2 And drains me, bleeds me,\n3 Leaves me cracked and empty,\n4 Drags me down like some sweet gravity.\n\n1 Adam's own conscience has now become the voice of temptation as He now indulges in the Fruit. \n2 The Fruit has now opened Adam's eyes to the world around Him. \n3 His Third Eye is no longer blind (to the \"naked eye\") and He is fully aware of right and wrong. He now has a sense of guilt and understanding. Adam/Eve then cover themselves in \"leaves\". The Union with God is \"cracked and the Garden is now \"empty\" of luxuries.\n4 Adam/Eve now experience guilt, shame, disgrace and depression (drags me down)\nAdam is now doomed to till the Earth and toil the soil\nThe Serpent was also \"cursed to the ground\" to crawl \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1 I am too connected to you to slip away, fade away.\n2 Days away I still feel you touching me, changing me and \n\n1. Connected by the rib (under the arm/care) the Two are inseparable. They are also forever bonded to God having been made in His Image.\n2. Days after the Expulsion they are still being \"touched\" by their \"Creators\" hand and being changed into who they have now become, yet always with the ability to \"change\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConsiderately killing me.\n\nThe Creator still seems to be punishing the Two\nLonging and lamentation over having been expelled\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWithout the skin here,\nBeneath the storm.\nUnder these tears now,\nThe walls came down.\n\nFrom the Creator's perspective:\nWithout the Creation in the Garden there is now a void and a sadness. The walls that once separated God's Children from the outside world is now non existent\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOnce the snake is drowned and as I look in his eyes,\nMy fear begins to fade,\nRecalling all of the times I could have cried then.\nI should have cried then.\n\nAs the walls come down and as I look in your eyes,\nMy fear begins to fade,\nRecalling all of the times I have died, and will die.\nIt's alright.\n\nI don't mind.\n\nAdam/Eve now fully understand to gain this knowledge and truly be free the Fruit had to be eaten. With knowledge comes responsibility. There is no gain without pain. Once the snake becomes a figment of the imagination it ceases to hold power and sway. They recall all the times They could have cried and did not because it was never necessary. Both Good and Evil need to exist. The mental wall, the fear, the obstacles come down.

I built myself up with walls all around and I would let no one in, approx. a year after that I met another man who tried to get me to open up to him and it took him forever but it finally worked and this song helped me realize that I have died, and will die again, so I needed to open my heart up literally. Every line has an important meaning to me and when he played it for me it helped me so much. Four years later I'm a healthier happier independent individual with a successful relationship. So even if it's painful to others to me this song is a reminder to me that pain is okay and must be overcome.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_329": "\n\"I am too connected to you to\r\nSlip away, to fade away\r\nDays away I still feel you\r\nTouching me, changing me,\r\nAnd considerately killing me\"\n\r\nthis song is obviously about a lover that's like a drug. and it's about fucking each other REALLY HARD.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_330": "\nThis song is about how you must die to the world before you can be saved and born again.
