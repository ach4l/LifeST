I think anyone who is a child of divorce will understand the concept of using a kid as leverage - \"look at how much I love her. You bitch\". If he really cared about his daughter so much he wouldn't turn a love song for her into that bullshit (which makes up the majority of his other songs). Listen to \"Drips\" - that's our new grown-up Eminem. That's like saying Family Guy is more mature and refined than South Park.\n\r\nBy the way - to all the 14 year old idiots going \"Fuck Kim yo\", you've never met her in your life and she has not had the platform to say one word about her marriage to Eminem.  Just because he airs all his dirty laundry in his songs doesn't make it all true. He says so himself.

Does everyone SERIOUSLY think that the people like Eminem are REALLY like that?  It's called BUISNESS!  He's fucking FAMOUS.  Do you think he'd dump all that?  Would you?  I also think that if it came between his daughter and his career, he'd dump his career.  The point is that I think Eminem is a pretty sensitive guy when it comes down to it.  He's not what everyone thinks he is.  This song shocked and moved me nearly to tears.  Em may not have the best singing voice in the world, but then again, do YOU?
