{"comment_0": "\nThis song paints a beautiful portrait about the pain of letting go and the sacrifices that we make for love. I am torn about the video, mostly because I have lost my own dog in the past, and reliving that pain is rough. However, the video has such beautiful imagery, that it was overall wonderful to watch. The video features a young girl (played by Miranda Cosgrove when the girl becomes a teenager) who, in the midst of feeling left out and abandoned by her friends, receives a puppy for her birthday. The dog makes her happier throughout her lifetime, but in the end, she needs to learn to be happy on her own. Her dog passes and she grows up to have her own daughter, who receives her own puppy for her birthday, and the cycle begins anew. The lyrics deal with reassessing relationships and making sure that they are still healthy for us and others before proceeding. The song and the video both recognize that while letting go is hard, it's a natural part of life, and once we get rid of things that no longer serve us, we can grow to be better than before.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
