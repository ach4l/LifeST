{"comment_0": "\nThis is the MOST CLEVER pop song ever and you're all wrong on its meaning.  The song is about a woman who learns her man is cheating on her and decides to shoot him (Happiness is getting revenge on your cheating husband by shooting him).  The song begins: \"She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a girl who misses much. \r\nDo do do do do do do do \r\nShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand \r\nLike a lizard on a window pane.\"  She's observant and when someone tries to conceal something she notices (You would wear velvet gloves to prevent stains and therefore prevent someone from detecting you).  The next lines follow: Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy \r\nWorking overtime \r\nA soap impression of his wife which he ate \r\nAnd donated to the National Trust. \r\nLying with your eyes indicates infidelity while his eyes desperately try to conceal the truth, the soap impression means that he didn't have high regard for his wifes intelligence, he figured he could commit sexual infidelity and she'd never notice because she trusts him too much.  Mother Superior jump the gun simply means Mother Superior (a nickname for the lady) pulled the trigger and shot him.  Then comes the brilliant twist, happiness is getting back at the unfaithful man.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI believe this song is about heroin addiction. \"she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a girl who misses much.\" describes the attitude of a heroin user who is relatively content with her new lifestyle. \"She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand\" is saying she is familiar with the high heroin produces, comparing the calming feel of the drug with being rubbed by a velvet hand. \"like a lizard on a window pane\" If you think about what is taking place when a lizard is on a window pane it is not hard to connect it again with opiates. Just think of an animal blocked from the natural world by a window, the outside world is visible but the animal (or heroin user) is disconnected to it. \"the man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors on his hobnail boots.\" describes a person who could possibly go undetected amongst a crowd but upon closer inspect would obviously be considered odd, someone who is different, a heroin addict. \"lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime\" says that this addict is trying to conceal his drug habits while he is busy pursuing them. \"a soap impression of his wife which ate and donate to the National Trust\" refers to the corruption of his once clean lover who he consumed (turned her into an addict) and changed into something disgusting (turn her into trash and flushed her down the toilet: donating to the National trust) \"I need a fix cause I'm going down, down to the bits I left uptown. I need a fix cause I'm going down\" is saying: I need to use heroin because I'm coming down, and going through withdrawals, the lack of drugs is ripping him apart, and the uptown reference could be referring to a particular spot in which drugs are purchased, saying, I need some more heroin because I'm hurting from withdrawals, so I need to go uptown, the place I always go to get heroin. The next set of lyrics uses \u00e2\u0080\u009cgun\u00e2\u0080\u009d to represent a needle. \"Mother superior's jump the gun\" is talking about a woman preparing a shot of heroin. \n\r\n\"happiness is a warm gun\" A needle+Heroin(which is usually heated prior to use) = happiness. The next line could be about a heroin addict singing to the needle \"when I hold you in my arms\" can be interpreted as when I've got the needle in my arm, \"and I feel my finger on your trigger\" and I feel my finger on the plunger (the part of the needle you need to push to inject the heroin) \"I know nobody can do me no harm because happiness is a warm gun\" the drug user knows that he's about to get high and therefore won't care about anybody or anything else. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBang, Bang shoot, shoot\u00e2\u0080\u009d are slang terms for shooting heroin.  \n\r\nAnd of course this is just my opinion, so, obviously it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 100% accurate and everyone else is totally wrong\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\n\n\n", "comment_2": "\nAccording to Lennon, the title came from the cover of a gun magazine that producer George Martin showed him: \"I think he showed me a cover of a magazine that said 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun.' It was a gun magazine. I just thought it was a fantastic, insane thing to say. A warm gun means you just shot something.\"[1] The reference, whether or not intermediately from the magazine, was one of many 1960s riffs on Charles M.

Come on, give the Beatles more credit. Their songs became ever more philosophical.

The message here is about human nature and the disturbing way that we embrace violence rather than peace.\n\r\nBut I admit he \"I need a fix 'cause I'm going down\" line sounds like drugs, haha.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nDefinite sexual innuendo. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nThe title of this song comes word for word from an advertisement John Lennon saw in a local paper.

Either getting a fix (of drugs) to try to fix their lives or to kill themselves with. Or a fix as in a fix for their situation. They need a fix cause \"I'm going down\". And \"happiness is a warm gun\" because they've finally escaped, they've just shot themselves. The gun comforts them when they \"hold you in my arms\" because they know the pain is almost over.

Mine is actually much simpler, although maybe not as good.\r\nListening to this song, especially with the line \"Happiness is a warm gun\", I felt it was about how you always seem to hurt someone when you're happy. Humans suffer so others can be happy and when it's their turn to be happy, they often make someone else suffer.\r\nThe girl who doesn't miss much is waiting to be happy, the reference to masturbation could indicate she's a teenager who wants to fall in love. The man in the crowd is probably happy but it's obvious his wife suffers. The mother superior (if it is a nun and not Yoko or a dealer) is going crazy because she has spent her life working on behalf of others, so they could be happy, and she has missed much. The narrator (John?) is unhappy because he's going down (as opposed to being high) and needs a fix (a shot of heroin), for him too happiness involves suffering, actually his own.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nHappiness is a warm gun, if you don't take the phrase literally, is a metaphor for conversation and how people say things.

[off-topic:  did you notice the reference in the film Trainspotting, where the dealer and veteran junky (who shoots the least experienced, i.e. \"jumps the gun\") was nicknamed \"Mother Superior\"?].   I can believe John took the title from a magazine cover but man... just listen to the entire lyrics and choruses, can any informed person claim it is not about junk or heavily influenced by it? It is noteworthy that the Beatles have refrained from speaking about the meaning of the song... They knew they were more popular than JC and tried not to set the worst example. Heroin was a rising issue these days, a tabboo floating around, dangerous and attractive. In fact it was about to become pandemic and (sadly!) destroy counter-culture and hippism. Very soon \"the dream was over\" (replaced by hang-over). Very few dared to talk straight about such a problem these days. Lou Reed did (and long before Lennon). Compare the lines of V.U.'s Waiting for the Man,  \"up to Lexington... hey you white boy what are you doing uptown..feel sick and dirty..etc\" with \"I need a fix cos i'm going down, down to the bits that I left uptown\". There is another song in the same [white] album that is also plaged with [rather petty in this case] euphemisms: Savoy Truffle... Have you read the \"song meaning\" account by its own author? You just won't believe it !

Lennon revered her and had somewhat of a oedipus complex towards her, seeing her as a mother figure. \r\nThirdly, the first part of the song is meant to be non-sensical. Lennon loved words and wrote his songs to fit the rhythm of the words that he used. He picked somewhat random words and put them together in a way that was metrically and rhythmically interesting.\r\nFinally, it is true that the idea for the song came from the cover of a magazine so it would not be a strech to say that it also has an ironic anti-war message. \n\r\nThe person who said that this song has many different layers is completely right.

I listened to it again a couple of times after reading some of the posts. Here's my interpretation:\r\nThe beginning is about John's obsession with Yoko: how she is mature enough to understand that sex is a game and promiscuity is widespread. 'Velvet hand' and 'lizard on a window pane' hint at prostitution. 'The man in the crowd with multi-coloured mirrors on his hobnail boots' is a pervert, that masturbates while looking up women's skirts. He was reduced to such a form after he consumed the idealized image of his wife ('soap impression') and subsequently parted with it ('donated to the National Trust').\r\n'I need a fix cuz I'm going down' is John dealing with the realization that relationships are inherently phony to human nature and promiscuity is abound. From this point onward, sex and drugs become interchangable: the 'gun' can be both a syringe or a phallus. 'Mother Superior' can refer to a drug dealer or a woman jumping 'the gun'. The 'warm gun' that creates happiness is purposely ambiguous as well (bang, bang creates sexual innuendo whereas shoot is more strongly connected to narcotics).\r\nIt's quite possible that the contrasting time signatures between drummer and vocal parts in the section that starts with 'When I hold you in my arms' was done to illustrate that sex and drugs, while topically different, have an intertwined foundation. 'Feel my finger on your trigger' seems to be an obvious double-entendre. 'I know no one can do me no harm' ties both sex and drugs together with the freedom of mind that mortality can create. The high 'gun' is a final orgasmic pageant, all things examined. :o)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_95": "\nWow, i totally agree with Dirty dan. i never thought of the song that way until now. It all makes sense. The song is about a woman who's man is unfaithful and obviously thinks lowly of her. He could also be abusing her (and i feel my finger on your trigger, and know no one can do me no harm) that quote also makes it seem like it was his gun that she took to shoot him. There is a definite sexual innuendo and the man seems like a creep (using mirrors on his boots to use look up girls skirts). I believe the song is coming from the woman not the man. also Lennon could have added the metaphor of shooting up heroin (\"need a fix, cause i'm going down) so it could go both ways at the same time, maybe a hidden desperate message of his drug abuse.  tho i wouldn't call this song pop, more like blues mixed with pure 70's brit rock.

(donating to the National Trust is a sarcastic statement about helping the National trust, an organization dedicated to perserving the enviroment by shitting in bushes.\n\r\n\"I need a fix 'cause I'm going down\r\nDown to the bits that I left uptown\" - He needs Yoko, his frustration is mounting.\r\n\"Mother Superior jump the gun\" - She gives it to him.\r\n\"When I hold you in my arms\r\nAnd I feel my finger on your trigger\r\nI know no one can do me no harm\" - An obvious exclaimation of his feeling safe with Yoko and pleasing this woman brought him back home.\r\n\"Because happiness is a warm gun\r\nYes it is\" - A warm gun is a dick in a vagina. And yes it is indeed happiness. Especially now that John doesn't feel so frustrated any longer.\n\r\n(Herion version)\r\nSee spiddygoodlegs post, it explains it pretty well.\r\n\"The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors on his hobnail boots\r\nLying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime\r\nA soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust\" - This is John professing that he has so far been into LSD and had not yet ventured into herion but was just lying to the outside about not wanting it while his hands were craving it since his Mother (Yoko) used it and she was smart, and wise and he wished to be her equal. In doing so he would be again, shitting out his wife who did not do herion and spoke against such hard drugs and was therefore 'clean', hence the soap.\n\r\n(Including current world affairs)\r\nSome of the opening statements are about stories in newspapers or magazine ads which he related to his sex and drug situation.\n\r\n\"The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors on his hobnail boots\r\nLying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime\r\nA soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the National Trust\" - See both explainations above.\n\r\n\"Happiness is a warm gun (bang bang, shoot shoot)\r\nWhen I hold you in my arms\r\nAnd I feel my finger on your trigger\r\nI know no one can do me no harm\r\nBecause happiness is a warm gun\r\nYes it is\" - Comparing a soldier's emotions of comfort with a gun to that of his own toward drugs and sex. Recognizing the relation to his own idiocy of need for his pleasures and the idiocy of a soldier with his gun.\n\r\nAlso, I think that Dagger dan could also be correct. And that his version could be Lennon's fear of his own wife if she were to discover his wrongdoings.\n\r\nPoint is, the song is meant to evoke a specific mindstate that Lennon felt in several areas in his life. Even though each subject is different, they all made him feel the same. So he worte a song that covered them all and connected each emotion and feeling.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_123": "\nAlso, about the time signaturesa being absolutely ridiculous... they are.\n\r\n     She's not a girl who misses much...

She believed he loved her and ultimately she kills him and herself for her betrayal of her vows and her God. Here is a line by line analysis (somewhat out of order for clarity): \n\r\n\"Mother Superior Jump the Gun\" is a multi-layered reference literally about a nun having intercourse prior to her death (and not just any nun, the leader of the convent), when she will (according to Catholicism) ultimately be (re)-united with her groom, Jesus. (Nuns wear a wedding ring on their right hand indicating they are \"married to Jesus\"); however, this is very likely a shot at organized religion by John.In addition, it also talks of her ultimate fate, which is suicide because of her earthly seduction by someone who doesn't love here.\n\r\n\"She's not a girl who misses much\": again, when taken in this context, she doesn't miss much, but not in the observational sense; in the experiential sense; not the normal things a nun should miss such as carnal knowledge and human love, although it also, based on the line: \"Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime.,\" is irony insofar as she could not tell that he was not truly in love with her and he seduced her and threw her away for sexual gratification only, at first with his eyes and and and with his soft caress.\n\r\n\"A soap impression of his wife\" - soap implies cleanliness, so he lied to her about his wife or marriage or cleaned the picture up in someway (perhaps telling her she is dead., or he cleaned it up in some way as to make it more palatable,) \"which he ate\" --why do we eat soap or have our mouths washed out with soap? For lying of course. \"And donated to the national trust.\" - he used this piece of information to win her over or to manipulate her, national in this sense meaning more universal or far-reaching.\n\r\n\"I need a fix cause I'm going down, down to the bits that I left uptown\"- this is literally a heroin reference to coming down, but here it means a sexual fix: he is going back to the broken woman he left \"uptown\"-- this word is important and is one of the key reasons that this is not a drug reference: If he meant heroin, he would have said \"downtown\", a euphemism for heroin (just as 'uptown' is a cocaine euphemism) but he is talking about the bits or shell of the woman he had this relationship, uptown implying class or somewhere of importance.\n\r\n\"Happiness is a warm gun, bang bang, shoot shoot,\" the nun ultimately commits suicide because she violates her vows and betrays Jesus, after she commits murder: she kills him. [There is a slight reference to Dante here insofar as she is already damned to Judecca, the 9th Circle, 4th Round of Hell (Canto XXIV) in Dante's Inferno (Part III of \"The Divine Comedy.\" The 9th Circle is reserved for Betrayers, but special betrayer's and the 4th Round in particular is for those who have betrayed God; it is reserved for the Biblical giants lie Judas & Satan as well as the assassins of Caesar, Claudius and Brutus (because Dante thought they betrayed Italy and the World by killing the Divinely Appointed unifier of Italy.)] Since she will already be damned for betraying Jesus, she will receive no additional punishment by killing her betrayer (whom she betrays by taking his life), and killing herself.\n\r\n\"When I feel my finger on your trigger, I know nobody can do me no harm\" This is irony as she believes no human can do her any more harm or even God because of her damnation. The warm reference in \"warm gun\", in addition to denoting that she fired the weapon, also is an ironic Dante reference because in the 9th Circle, you are frozen in ice and not burned by fire, up to a level commensurate with your crimes.\n\r\n\"She's well acquainted with the touch of a velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane\" - this is a masturbation reference not an LSD reference. Her desires for love and carnal pleasure have often lead to masturbation. \"The man in the crowd with the multi-colored mirrors on his hob-nail boots\" Hob-nail boots imply that he was working class, used for traction so the he doesn't fall off and reveal his true self to her; the mirrors have several meanings: one, the obvious one, is that he is a pervert, peaking under dresses using mirrors on his boots, but below that level is that of her vision of herself as she looks down, constantly reflecting back at her the betrayal she is about to commit. He is also covering his working class boots with the reflection or the fantasy of what he wants her to believe, but she is a willing participant, ready to believe him.\n\r\nMobiusDick\n\r\n****Note that all interpretations of this song are valid except one and that is John Lennon's own. If you study the literary criticism of the 2oth Century beginning with Ezra Pound, John Crowe Ransom, James Joyce and TS Elliott, you realize we are in the century of Relativity; whatever meaning a song has to you is a valid interpretation [It is the meaning a song has (to you)]. The reason the author is excepted from interpretation is because of another artifact of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics (i.e,,modern physics) references, and that is related to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In physics, this means that we cannot exactly know both momentum (velocity, { that is {times mass}) and location X at the same time. [\u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009dX \u00c3\u0083\u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00a0P \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00b0\u00c2\u00ae h\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0081\u00e2\u0080\u009e2\u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0082\u00ac ]. When we know one exactly, we must sacrifice our knowledge of the other such that the product of the uncertainty of the two measurements is greater than Plank's Constant divided by 2\u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0082\u00ac ; or, in terms of Energy and Time [ \u00c3\u008e\u00e2\u0080\u009dE \u00c3\u0083\u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u0086\u00e2\u0080\u00a0T \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u00b0\u00c2\u00ae h\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0081\u00e2\u0080\u009e2\u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u0082\u00ac].\n\r\nWhen using this in terms of literary criticism, the person creating the work has too much psychological baggage to interpret his or her own work. In other words, you cannot step outside of yourself and see what you look like to other people. A good example of this occuring to me personally where I began to really understand the significance, was when I was reading over some poetry from a college poetry magazine I had been involved with in the early 1990's, The pages were typed so I could not recognize the handwriting. I read two peoms that I was blown away by and I was trying to determine which of the people involved in the magazine had written the poems. I suddenly realized they were my own work; immediately, I no longer was able to see anything special about the poems, and I began picking them apart line by line. I have always been very critical of my own writing and I cannot look at it from an unbiased veiw. No matter how many people tell me how much they like it or how impressed theey are, it is hard for me to get beyond the phase of self-doubt.

She is used to the role like a lizard is used to be on a windowpane (also suggests a sort of voyeurism to the song).\n\r\nThe man wears multicolored mirrors on his  Hobnail boots (inexpensive boots with nails on the bottom of the shoe that were popular in World War II the Nazi's/ German soldiers wore them and goose stepped with them). Cocaine you use Mirrors to cut and use.

To me The White Album is more of a Lennon album.\r\nSgt. Pepper & Magical Mystery Tour-- basically Paul's.\r\nJohn really did like the MMT album tho.\r\nI think that after all the acid & LSD, then Yoko came into the picture, John started really writing kick-ass songs like he did on Revolver & Rubber Soul. You can tell what albums that he really was into.\r\nI love songs that aren't quite as popular as the \"big hits\", \"greatest hits\" or what have you, that you hear over and over all the time on the radio. I like the deep cuts.\r\n\"Happiness...\" is a deep cut. But is one of the best songs on the White Album.\r\nThere's a few crappy Paul songs that really shouldn't be on \"The Beatles\"!!\n\r\nAllsIknow is when it gets to the lyric:\r\n\"I need a fix cuz I'm goin down\"....

I've been a fan of The White Album since it was released, and this is one of my favorites on it. \n\nThe meaning, however, only occurred to me recently, while I was attempting a \"big picture\" understanding of the Beatles.\n\nAn alternative, though appropriate name for this song could very well have been \"Brian's Song\". \n\nThe importance of the role Brian Epstein played in the Beatles saga can not be overstated! They were talented when he met them, but he CREATED them. Their look. Their on-stage manners. Their recording contract. And perhaps most importantly, his ability to MANAGE them, with their egos and all (esp Lennon / McCartney). Brian resolved all their differences in one way or another. He was, in some ways, their boss. They fought amongst themselves, but Brian could always make it ok. \n\nThen he died. Suddenly. Tragically. Early. Without him there to be \"the glue\" that held it all together, they fell into disharmony, competition, and to some level, contempt.\n\nThe White Album is their first studio album RECORDED after his death. (Mystery tour was released after his death, but the recordings were completed by April '67. He died in August.)\n\nContemplate the lyrics in that light, and they make perfect sense. George and Paul had both stated it is their favorite cut on the album. That is not only because they actually collaborated. It is also because it is a memorial to Brian. (As is, I believe, the utter absence of any cover art. ie \"go into the light\")\n\n\"She's\" not a \"girl\" who misses much. (Brian was gay; referring to him as \"she\" would not be that unusual.)...Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime. (Brian was closeted by necessity. It was still illegal in the UK until a year after he died. Meanwhile, he was very savvy and ambitious. His efforts paid off, big time.)\n\n\"I need a fix 'cause I'm going down\". On the night of his death, Brian had planned to host a \"party boy\" night at his country estate. When the party boys didn't show up, he went back to London, where he accidentally) overdosed on sleeping pills.\n\n\"Mother Superior Jumped The Gun\". Brian WAS \"Mother Superior\", in managing the Beatles. He \"jumped the gun\" by accidentally killing himself, in his early 30's.\n\n\"Happiness is a warm gun\". The double meaning is obvious.\n\nThe song is clearly a memorial to Brian Epstein.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_173": "\nObvious interpretation happiness is a temporary state\n\nwarm gun\n\nheat causes bullet to fire\n\nfucking idiots\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_174": "\nAlternative explanation the gun is warm not at firing range.
