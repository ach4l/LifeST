Here is my interpretation of the lyrics for each of the 3 verses in the song:\n\r\nVerse 1:\r\nMy Life Suffocates\r\nPlanting Seeds of Hate\r\nI've Loved, Turned to Hate\r\nTrapped Far Beyond My Fate\n\r\nI Give\r\nYou Take\r\nThis Life That I Forsake\r\nBeen Cheated of My Youth\r\nYou Turned this Lie to Truth\n\r\n-- This is giving a historical view of the Harvester of Sorrows' life. It explains how he became the Harvester of Sorrow. It's pretty straight forward, no need to go into detail here.\n\n\r\n2nd Verse:\r\nPure Black Looking Clear\r\nMy Work Is Done Soon Here\r\nTry Getting Back to Me\r\nGet Back Which Used to Be\n\r\nDrink up\r\nShoot in\r\nLet the Beatings Begin\r\nDistributor of Pain\r\nYour Loss Becomes My Gain\n\r\n-- This verse explains how he thinks about himself and how the Harvester of Sorrow deals with it. He attempts to \"get back which used to be\" by abusing drugs and alcohol. Which results in him becoming violent. At this point it does not indicate that he is violent towards his family. The Harvester of Sorrow could just be getting in fights at bars or places he gets drunk and high at (like when people get drunk at bars and start fights ... get it?). Essentially, he gets drunk/high and takes his anger out on others.\n\r\n3rd Verse:\r\nAll Have Said Their Prayers\r\nInvade Their Nightmares\r\nSee into My Eyes\r\nYou'll Find Where Murder Lies\n\r\nInfanticide\n\r\n-- This is the verse that indicates that the Harvester of Sorrow has finally snapped and beats and murders his children (indicated by infanticide ... which has nothing to do with abortion BTW). He has finally become the Harvester of Sorrow.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI've always inferred that this song was about someone who's suffered horribly and perceives themselves as being wronged and even persecuted on all sides.  As a result, they become bitter, unable to feel compassion for other humans, and lash out angrily and even violently.  This resembles certain schizophrenia-type mental disorders (note: scizophrenia =/= multiple personality disorder), where the sufferer becomes paranoid and perceives themselves as being persecuted on all sides.  The song's lyrics and its emphasis on violence, alienation, and emotional blunting best matches the development of clinical psychopathy.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI'm thinking this is either a generalized Grim Reaper/Final Judgement song like Metallica is so fond of, or a bloody-justice teenage revenge anthem. I'm leaning towards the latter. Why you ask? I'll explain.\n\r\nThe song clearly indicates a strong feeling of victimhood and unjustified abuse. A person of formerly pure intentions (\"Planting Seeds of Hate, I've Loved, Turned to Hate, Trapped Far Beyond My Fate\") has been driven into vengeful bloodlust by a lifetime of mistreatment (\"I Give, You Take, This Life That I Forsake, Been Cheated of My Youth, You Turned this Lie to Truth). \n\r\nThe person in question is now motivated only by pure rage and pain (\"Anger, Misery, You will Suffer unto Me\", Distributor of Pain, Your Loss becomes my gain\" etc.) and he proceeds to exact bloody payment (\"All Have Said Their Prayers, Invade Their Nightmares, See into My Eyes, You'll Find Where Murder Lies) on those who planted the seeds of hate in his heart, pushed him beyond his normal limits of morality, took from him when he did nothing but give to them, and robbed him of his innocence. \n\r\nHe has become the Harvester of Sorrow.\n\r\nSo basically, take your average school shooter's life story and make a song out of it, and this is what you get.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\njust listen in sorrow and awe to the skill of the drummer in the first 1.17 minutes.. this song is really a chellenge for any respectable drummer and Lars seems to to give the best of himself here... It is a song dominated by anger, frustration and sorrow. The heavy guitar riff and the Bass drum rolls confirm this... i believe that if you take away the lyrics from this piece, the song will loose none of its prowess, and will still express the true pain and feeeling put in the treated subject.... Lars rules, and though technically he may not be at the skill of such drummers as Mike Portnoy, or Danny Carey, he is still my favorite drummer cause he has the ability of transmitting all his wrath and passion through his pounding...

The Harvest of Sorrows, it was when the russians when to a city where their were a bunch of farms, they made the people harvest their crops and give it to them. for years the russians came back and took all their crops, causing the people living there to die of starvation. \"Planting seeds of hate\". Obviosly these farmers who were planting the crops knew where they were going to, so they hated planting them becuase they knew the russians were gunna take it. \"I give, You take\" this explains that the people gave little crops at first, then the russians got greedy a took it all, this isnt a song about \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nJoeMaster bullseyed it; thats the original meaning intended by the composer(s). Very straight forward.\n\r\nNever the less, I like to think that beyond that straight forward meaning there's also an obscurant or faithfull one. It's a general complaint from a man directly to God himself - (sort of like a angry prayer if you wish), about how the poor evolution of his life (\"My life suffocates, Planting seeds of Hate\"; \"I love, turned to hate\"; \"you turned this lie to truth\"; \"I give, you take, this life that I forsake\"), turned into a present state of total frustration, considering facts and indicators that could initially point in his favor (youth, innocence, inconditional love torwads life and people). \n\r\nWith \"Anger, Misery, You'll Suffer unto Me\", God responds to him in his particular, intangible and superior way, like a true and all mighty master submits servants, by telling them that in order to reach his symphaty (and whatever that can lead to), he must first suffer to gain His trust...you know, to be reliable. To me, \"You'll Suffer unto Me\" is a too strong verse to refer simply to bad parent towards his child, or to any sort of \"booze itself\" torwads any drunk. But it fits nicelly if u think it's God. With \"your loss becomes my gain\", eventually the guy compreends that God knows that all his sacrifice will obvisously mean little or nothing to him in his mortal, short and pathetic life, but will certainly favour Him, in a misterious and much superior way.\n\r\nThe complainging comes from a man who has a life not even close to what he once expected it to be, or thinks or thought he deserved - this based in a self-judgement he makes of his once young self - a pure, innocent and highly energized and life-loving child - \"I loved, turned to hate\". The self judment is also implied in \"been cheated of my youth\" and \"trapped far beyond my fate\". It all helps building the obvious frustration. The background can be only one: poor, if not horrible, but at least neglectful - parenting.\n\r\nIn the end, he's feels so miserably torwards life, he senses he's got nothing else to give or fight for, thus leading him to start feeling he's closed to dying, or at least he can no longer feel that life welcomes him, but instead its death he senses coming closer (Pure Black Looking Clear, My Work Is Done Soon Here). At this point, God then tries to encourage him by a very tricky and dubious verse: \"Try Getting Back to Me; Get Back Which Used to Be\". This could mean God wants him to love life again, like he did in his young age, by whatever \"good means\" necessary.\n\r\nIn the end, the man remembers times he thought of murdering ppl as a way of ending great sources of the suffering (this could've come in momments of getting bullied, for instance, as many bullied children actually think or even dream of assassinating their agressors).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nI believe this song is about depression and how it can take the toll of an individual to a deep, dark path, eventually into drugs, booze, then to murder.

As the first one said I believe it is about a man who snapes.

Like the person after that saying that \"Planting Seeds of Hate\" refers to unwanted sperm, i have to agree no teen wants to be a parent.  As for \"Been cheated of my youth\" refers to after you have a kid you can no longer act like a kid and are forced to grow up. \"Ive loved turned to hate\" could refer to the man blaming his girlfriend for getting pregnant which is a natural respons for a teen.

Much like Drugs in \"Master of Puppets\".\n\r\n\"Let the Beatings Begin\" - Not necessarily beating someone else up, but pschologically beating yourself up because you've fallen off the wagon, or you hate how you are after drinking and therefore beat yourself up over it.\n\n\r\n\"Your Loss Becomes My Gain\" - Often Alcoholics will continue to drink because it numbs whatever their pain they're going through.\n\r\n\"Harvester of Sorrow\r\nLanguage of the Mad\" - This is saying that alcohol will only make you depressed, and that it'll make you mad, as often alcoholic end up.\n\n\r\nInterestingly, when you view this in context of the time, James was reportedly going through his partying/drinking phase, which would culiminate in his checking into rehab many years later, during \"St. Anger\".\n\r\nSo, as quite often the case, maybe this song was a form of subconscious therapy for James at the time.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_27": "\nChris Geez,\r\nIt looks to me that you thought about this song way too much, even though I know what you are saying and somewhat agree with you.

There is a verse in the Bible, the first part of which says, \" he who soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption\". The song is talking about the actions or \"vices\" of a person having direct consequences. His life suffocates as a direct result of the seeds of hate he has planted. Ive loved, turned to hate- thats talking about a vice, habit, or action of some sort that the person  \r\n\"loved\" , but has only returned \"hate\" or misery, as a direct consequence.\r\n I give, you take, this life that I forsake.  Again, giving his time and passion to his vice,  the vice ending up figuratively, or even literally, taking his life. ( been cheated of my youth) \r\nYou turned the lie to truth- The lie that the vice would bring satisfaction, but turning into the truth that his life has been destroyed\r\n Anger, misery, youll suffer unto me- The \"vice\" is talking, saying that anger and misery are the result of the action  or vice that the person engaged in.\r\n Pure black, looking clear - The vice or action is pure evil (black), but on the outside , it looks pure and harmless ( clear) before he gets sucked into its consequences.\r\nTry getting back to me, get back what used to be- The person wants to get back to the beginning when the vice was fun and appeared to be harmless, but the consequences of  his actions has caused damage and pain that he cannot get out of.\r\n I could continue , but the rest of the lines of the song obviously follow the same theme- that sowing corrupt or evil actions causes reaping of sorrow and misery.

I dont see how that would fit into the rest of this emotion filled song.\r\nInfanticide is simply the killing of a baby or and infant, usually by a parent or caretaker. A baby is a completely defenseless and innocent undeveloped creature that relies completely on the trusting the parent or caretaker to survive and grow. So I doubt any babies being killed were the problem in this song. If taken figuratively and in context, infanticide might refer to a total bitch move on a trusting and defenseless victim. Naturally the victim might want revenge.\r\nSo in light of the rest of the song which gives a strong sense of a victim mentality, I think that infanticide further drives home the justification for revenge.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_64": "\nI think you guys are being too literal.

I get into the house and I drink some of my WHISKEY in a JAR but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ease the pain clearly caused by the THORN WITHIN. At this point even i know the only solutions to deal with the STRUGGLE WITHIN. In the SMALL HOURS of the morning I stare into the dark night and see ORION, but now is not the time to think about ASTRONOMY the pain is too much it feels like I'm TRAPPED UNDER ICE yet I cant seem to convince myself that its my fault, betrayed by who i thought was a friend and betrayed by THE JUDAS KISS now I go towards my bed in this old rugged house, how am I supposed to sleep in THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT after I shot him between the eyes and left him STONE DEAD FOREVER and at that point it felt like NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. I close my eyes and try to sleep hoping it will all just FADE to BLACK but THE MEMORY REMAINS clear to me that I will always be UNFORGIVEN and it worries me because the things i just did make me wonder AM I EVIL. This cant be I was raised right how did I turn to this BAD SEED I know what I did was wrong but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like I am on ANESTHESIA.\n\r\nI had lost my mind when I decided it was KILLING TIME, I ran around taking them all out high on drugs I believed I was the INVISIBLE KID and the opponents I took out one by one where DISPOSABLE HEROES. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep so I stay up looking at the DIRTY WINDOW and start to think maybe its time I DISAPPEAR because right now I am CREEPING DEATH at any point the cops and feds will be all over looking for me. For so long I looked forward to exerting my revenge but that day seemed to be THE DAY THAT NEVER COMES nothing hurts more than taking the life of your BROTHERS IN ARMS. The pain was too much yet still I feel like the HERO OF THE DAY and I decided not to think about what others thought of me after all to the one who I was revenging I would always be the perfect PRINCE CHARMING her LOVERMAN as was the case when she lived and everyone else called me KING NOTHING. As my nerves began to calm I remember what MAMA SAID about salvation forgiveness trusting in God and THE FOUR HORSEMEN but I will not pray to THE GOD THAT FAILED seeing as he let my loved one die she truly was MY FRIEND OF MISERY so I decide to live the rest of my life with NO REMORSE.\n\r\nKnowing my fate as I step into the bathroom that bottle of CYANIDE seems appealing but I will not give up I will FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. Arrested I find myself locked in a SANATARIUM because the cops couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any normal person could do what I did. The DEVILS DANCE is what they called it and maybe this is where I would spend the rest of my days on THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY. A brilliant mind I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve to be here but what i did deserves to be punished and that is SAD BUT TRUE. At this rate I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think even a priest can PURIFY my soul. I think of to myself POOR TWISTED ME but I decide to not have self pity because when it comes to who killed those men I will always be the ONE. From a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy RONNIE went on to become a killer and sometimes I would think SO WHAT right until the judge decided i would RIDE the LIGHTENING. I know I am SOME KIND of MONSTER but do I really deserve to die. The judge is not letting me off easy as he proclaims THAT WAS JUST YOUR LIFE and now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached THE END OF THE LINE. Alone in my cell I think it seems I have become THE OUTLAW TORN thinking about SUICIDE AND REDEMPTION what to do I cant let them kill me oh the STRUGGLE WITHIN talk about THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE. After a nights sleep I think maybe its fine after all TO LIVE IS TO DIE what is this THE UNNAMED FEELING maybe its time to TURN THE PAGE. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
