{"comment_0": "\nWritten by JB for his friends T&L Ewing. Historical account about Charles Hatfield and his brother hired by the Wide Awake Society of San Diego to bring water to the town in a drought. \n\r\nThis song also is about a big fat German lady who gets drunk, plays all sorts of different blues on all sorts of differently stranged banjos. She also lures the children to her home like scylla and charibdes with pies and booze...her daughter also helps in this corruption of children by going around the neighborhood with a 6 pack of assorted beers:Usually Pabst Blue Ribbons and Gennie Cream Ales.\n\r\nThe Hatfield family is currently under investigation for running a child pornography ring.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
