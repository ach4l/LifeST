In this song, he talks about his desire to make his relationship with the right girl last. This song encourages us not to give up and to stay positive during even the most heartbreaking cases of relationship. \n\r\n The beginning of this song is Michael Bubl\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9 talks about having his heart broken many times and trying to get too worked up about it. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a line in the song that says \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I know someday that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all turn out\u00e2\u0080\u009d (10) and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s him showing that he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given up yet.  Then in the next stanza it says \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make me work, so we can work to work it out\u00e2\u0080\u009d (11). In this stanza he is talking about working really hard in the relationship that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have with the right girl so that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to go through another break up again. The beginning of this song, I think, is elegiac. He seems sad about getting his heart broken. I think the rest of the song is hortatory because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s encouraging and positive. \n\r\nI think that this song is postmodernism because it is a personal song. The things Michael Bubl\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9 is singing about is not a universal truth, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how he thinks about his own life and how he chooses to live it. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nAMAZING LYRICS :) thats all i can say in my 2 cents\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nstory of my life.

After a couple of heartbreaks, people can start easily attaching to people just in hope of finding \"the one\". \n\nThat is my interpretation, at least. I am most definitely one of the people who do this anyway.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_32": "\nMore like he's learned a lot from the mistakes in his life, specially in love and relationships, and continuously learned from them.

Go figure. Great lines, well put words, nice rhymes, good phrasing.\r\nOverall it's a very good piece of music, even though it's modern.

For instance, when he says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give so much more than I get\u00e2\u0080\u009d;  newborn babies and even just kids in general aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always easy to parent, so he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying that he knows it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be hard, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s willing to work for it. He also wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t refer to a love interest as \u00e2\u0080\u009ckid\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which is also what leads me to think he really is singing about his child. He also starts the song saying that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really want to have kids, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna do it anyway. It sounds like his wife really wants to have kids, but he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so much. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convincing himself that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna work out and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be great. Then, it wraps it up when he says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t met you yet\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Of course he hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t met a kid that hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been born yet. So, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my interpretation of the meaning, but I could be wrong.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
