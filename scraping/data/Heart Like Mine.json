She's not the norm, she's the opposite of what people consider right. But she's saying that whatever she does, bad or good, that God loves her and that He would understand her. I can relate to this song to a tee. Great song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nEven though she doesnt fit in with the Christian stereotypes that judge her, she knows that her relationship with Jesus is solid and doesn't really give a flip what they think..  Love this song, would love to hang out drinking wine with Jesus!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
