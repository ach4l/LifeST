{"comment_0": "\nI've heard Tyler's pastor speak. This is his philosophy and the philosophy of most modern non-denominational churches these days. Those of us who are Christians should be part of the non-Christian world. We aren't great at accepting \"heathens\" into our midst, but we absolutely need to accept them AND LOVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE, HOW THEY ARE, WHO THEY ARE. Engage with the culture. Love them. Love people in trouble, people in prison, people in need. Don't preach. Just build relationships with them. Don't jump immediately into sharing your faith - take it slowly and get to know them first. You don't know how they may have been abused by so-called Christians in the past. And be sincere in your love for them - if you're just there trying to convert them, they'll smell your intentions. Wait for them to ask YOU about who you know (Jesus). By then, you will be a trusted friend and you can share the story of the love and grace you have received. And whether or not they convert doesn't matter - that's not your job - your job is to just share the love you have received with the rest of the world, share your faith if the opportunity arises, and let God do the rest.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nWho do YOU know?!\n\r\nOnly a heathen with rooms of people will know the meaning and that is the way it needs to be or it would never get played on a single radio.

Like I said, I'm still kind of sceptical about this theory\n\r\n\"Your loving on the phsycopath sitting next to you,\r\nYour loving on the murderer sitting next to you\" \n\r\nLike I mentioned before, this might be referring to people who have mental issues from killing people in war\"\n\r\n\"Just because we check for guns at the door, doesn't mean our brains will change for hand granades\" \n\r\nAlso could be mental issues from war\n\r\nIt would also explain other things mentioned in the song (trust issues, being skittish, etc.)\n\r\nI'm a bit sceptical on this theory but whatever \n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI think the song is referring to the clique (twenty one pilots fans) and the new people in it and telling them to be careful as the clique doesn't handle newcomers or outsiders (heathens) very well.  I think Tyler is also talking about the fans who only know stressed out or ride when he says \"wait for them to ask you who you know\".\r\nWhen the voice in between parts of the song says \"watch it\" hes telling the new fans to watch their back.\r\nAt the end of the song he says \"I tried to warn you just to stay away\" hes referring to the song and hes warned you about the fan base and now \"it looks like you might be one of us\" one of us being the Skeleton Clique.\r\n|-/\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nPersonally I think it's a story, the singer is the narrator and is telling you about what's going to happen next before it happens but at the same time says \"take it slow\" as if all knowing and don't worry about it, almost in a relaxed manner and in the end it says \"looks like you might be one of us\" as a you have come this far and you so tangled up in it even though they where warned not to get involved and in the end the person is no better than the murders and psychopaths and there's no turning back to being a normal person.And in the end your like everyone else, doing what ever it takes to keep the people you care about safe even if it means sitting next to a strange person that could change your life forever ether in a good way or a bad.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nAmazing this is the best song on earth i love it it is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nThis is the only 21 Pilots song I know.

Everyone in there is from a tough background and is just having a hard time dealing with life. Most times it's from past abuse that people are having a hard time grieving from. And while someone is checked into a mental hospital life that you get to really know the psychopaths that are sitting next to you. People that are literally on sedatives because they are diagnosed psychopathic. It's pretty interesting to look at it from that point of view. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nOK so don't get mad just is this MY interpretation of the song only because a news story is stuck in my head regarding Muskogee and a man jailed for stalking.

My interpretation is the narrator is part of a gang consisting only of heathens that has suffered significant amount of abuse from others and thus united to fight back against the abusers. Afterwards they find that many people want to join them, but \"always\" for the wrong reasons (could eg. be a teenager rebellion where they arent really mistreated, wanting the status etc.) or other things are wrong about them. And here the narrator procceed to warn those people with prhases like \"We don't deal with outsiders very well\" and \"they say they can smell your intentions\". And for the part about them being heathen, well heathen means someone who dont belong to a widely held religion, and it could be coincidence, but I think the emphasis lies on \"dont talk to us about your god\" like we dont need anyone to tell us what to think and believe in, we already made up our mind\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nHeathen is to be naive or innocently unaware of god (synonymous with love). It implores people to be gentle and compassionate instead of judgemental. We're all worthy of love. Its not a Christian song, its a human one. Catholicism simply coined the the term heathen.
