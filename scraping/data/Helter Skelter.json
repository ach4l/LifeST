This song, in particular, was believed to tell them to start a race war between the blacks and the whites, in which the blacks would end up winning and then then Manson Family could emerge from the Bottomless Pit in which they had been staying while the war had been going on, and they would rule over the blacks. When Manson personally felt that the race war wasn't happening soone enough he decided they would start the war, and ordered the Tate murders and then the LaBianca murders. The song really has nothing to do with that, or at least, most people don't interpret it that way.\n\r\nCharles Manson didn't think he was Jesus, by the way, not really.
