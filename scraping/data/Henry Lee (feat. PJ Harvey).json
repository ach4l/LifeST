In a twisted kind of way.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nwow! i first heard this song when i friend of mine played it at a party....the \"la la la la la\" part just haunted me for days before i figured out which song it was from the lyrics. theres something so eerie and waltz-like about it. the melody just wraps itself around your head and twists in hooks with the lyrics. a truely beautiful song. seriously.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nSlightlyMad, I think you are right on with the comparison to Poe.\r\nIt also have some charactaristcs from mideval ballads with expressions like \"lily white hand\", and the rythm of the lyrics with the same lines at the end of every verse instead of the usual verse-chorus-verse-chorus...or however the modern pop song go.\n\r\nA wonderful song. The meaning is very straight forward though. Not much room for interpretation there, hehe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nBeautiful song, and the video is damn sexy.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nI don't know if nick and Pj were ever a couple.

Mr. Cave has the job of keeping these tracks alive pretty much to himself these days.  Fascinatiing stuff.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\n'Murder Ballads' is an equal opportunities album! Altho' most of the murderers are male (as in life), the women get a fair go, too. Old ballads are full of jealous & murderous women, & some of those ballads are far more extreme than anything Nick Cave has done. That last verse is chilling - \"the girl you have in that merry green land/ can wait forever for you to come home\". That line sends a shiver down my spine.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nI think Nick Cave draws pretty successfully not just on Poe's style but also on the whole Victorian predilection with the macabre, as well as a style that reminds me of early 20th century/depression era.\n\r\nHe also does a pretty good job of taking traditional/historical themes and putting his own spin on it. \n\r\nMurder Ballads is a good album to hole up with and listen to when you're pissed off with the world.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_19": "\nThis song reminds me a LOT of William Faulkner's short story \"A Rose For Emily\".\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_20": "\nI always thought it had something to do with Henry Lee Lucas and his somewhat incestous relationship with his mother...anyone else ever heard that?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_21": "\nSimply gorgeous.
