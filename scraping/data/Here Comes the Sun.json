The use of \u00e2\u0080\u009csun\u00e2\u0080\u009d giving off a bright and joyful feeling, and I believe that and the fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repeated 10 times throughout the entire song is used to emphasize the idea that better times are coming. \n\nIn the first verse of the song, The Beatles reference winter time even though the majority of the song focuses on the sun. I believe that they did it to symbolize the more melancholic times. That can be seen as they say \u00e2\u0080\u009clong cold lonely winter\u00e2\u0080\u009d, for the use of \u00e2\u0080\u009clonely\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009ccold\u00e2\u0080\u009d give off a sadder mood than the rest of the song. \n\nHowever, in the second verse they say that winter \u00e2\u0080\u009cseems like years since it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been here\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and I say that is done in order to metaphorically say that the subject of the song went from a depressing and more \u00e2\u0080\u009cwintery\u00e2\u0080\u009d time to a happier \u00e2\u0080\u009csummer\u00e2\u0080\u009d time. \n\nLastly, the subject of the song constantly references a \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle darling\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and those two words turned the entire song into a conversation form one to another, as if it could be a father and a daughter or maybe a couple. It makes the song a lot more encouraging because it shows that as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telling the other person that thing can and are getting better, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s realizing that himself.\n\nI believe that in its entirety, the message of the song is that better times are coming no matter how \u00e2\u0080\u009ccold\u00e2\u0080\u009d life is getting.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_45": "\nA very optomistic song.

Its a Sunday-afternoon-post-lunch-stoned-15-minutes-nap song for me. George I miss you man. I dont think George is underated. To me he is the best musician and human being ever existed on this planet.

That's just it. Wow. This song is just amazing. It makes you feel like everything's gonna be alright because one day that sun (whether it's a person, God, or some event) will come on out and take away all of your sorrows. I simply love this song. George rocks. He's definitely my favorite and I wish that he was still here... :'(\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_79": "\nThis another song that was supposed to be a \"Paul is dead\" clue.  It's about the morning after Paul had his car crash (a very rainy night, you can hear the \"storm\" at the end of She's So Heavy), and about the band members moving on and finding Paul's \"replacement\".

I'm not to sure why but somehow the whole song is just so... uplifting. At one point I'd listen to it constantly. Now I'm listening to it again many months later.

When a sun rises shows that its the dawn of a new day, throughout the song it is referenced that \"it feels like years since its been here\". My imperpretation of the \"long cold lonely winter\" was war, or something tragic that happened. The war/tragic event has passed and therefor the sun has risen.\n\n\"The smiles are returning to the faces\" is showing that people are recovering from the tragedy and it has been a while since it was that way. \"The ice is slowly melting\" shows the bitterness of war (winter) causes people to be close minded and predujice towards one another, but the \"ice is slowly melting\" and now its a lot more open and free.\n\nThis is an absolute amazing song and its bound to put a smile on someone's face, I love the beatles and see them as one of the big pioneers of music.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_91": "\nGeorge may have been familiar with the writing 's of Samual Birley Rowbotham. ..Earth not a Globe.
