{"comment_0": "\nI think this song is far more personal to James than being about soldiers off to war but everyone is entitled to their interpretation. It has a great dream like quality, rich in symbolism. Ultimately it is about James' feelings toward his mother. Remember that he starts the song addressing his mother. \n\r\nThere is a tradition where a lighted candle is lit and left in the window to help travellers find their way back home. In this song it sets a metaphor of the home being the family and the love that holds the family together. That love keeps a person returning to their family, their mother, throughout the journey of life. The travelers represent the author who like all children sets out on the journey of life looking to be cared for. A hero is someone who saves you, protects you and cares for you. This also the role of a mother. The Hero of the Day that he seeks is his mother.\n\r\nBut in this case something is wrong because the window itself is lit on fire suggesting that the person at home is over zealous in their desire for the travellers to return. Their love could actually destroy the home. The idea of being overwhelmed by his mother's love is common in James lyrics, like the Apron strings around his neck in Mama Said or the fury he feels in Dyer's Eve. And just as in Dyer's Eve he feels unprepared to face the world due to being sheltered from it by his mother, James expresses that same fear and anger toward his mother because now that he is on this journey and she is gone he feels vulnerable to the world and worries that he may fall by someone's wicked ways. He wonders if his mother can hear her baby crying, does she know the pain he feels? All he can hear is her sighing. Now that she is dead all that remains is the whispers of her voice in her mind.\n\r\nAs the song progresses you feel that transition from the soothing mellow intro that is like being cradled by his mother's love to that furious anger expressed as the music breaks into the verse about the dreams and the waking screams which is him living through the pain and anger he feels toward a mother he can no longer reconcile with. And then of course the song ends with the repetition of the whole point of the song,  that the world is trying to break him and his need to feel her love again. Always James wants love but is afraid of it because love is control to him.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\ngreat song by a great band.

That said, let me give what it means to me.\n\r\nThe first part of the song is a reference to soldiers going off to war and how there thoughts are always on home.  The line \"if they should fall by someone's wicked way\" is about falling in battle.\n\r\nThe second part is about how so many soldiers continue to fight the war after they come home. \"no, I'm not all me\" is about how a soldier is forever changed into a different person by war, while \"things return to me that still seem real\" is a clear reference to PTSD, along with \"but now the dreams and waking screams that ever last the night\".  \n\r\nI think the song refers to how a soldier going off to war is \"the hero of the day\" and then how different it is when they come home.  Even things like \"don't want your aid\", clearly about how a lot of soldiers try to deal with PTSD themselves instead of seeking help.\r\nJust my 2 cents worth.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nit's pretty vague lyrically, as it seems to almost be talking about different things. what i feel he is saying is similar to mo0stah, but it involves looking up to someone who is not quite the hero of the day you thought they were.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nHero of the Day Interpretation: Personal victory is within our reach. Each person in this war is fighting not to win, but to find their honor.  \r\nWhat if someone fighting, dies in vein? \r\nThe fight is so long and hard, it's easy to become discouraged.  Keepers of these inner flames that thirst for honor, can you acknowledge\r\nthe ones who care about you, praying for your safe return from your journey?  Your loved ones want you with them, not your dream of\r\npersonal conquest.  Will the enemy break my will?  They haven't relented.  Now this fight seems so vein, remembering the reason I was brought here.\r\nIt seems I can relax now, I've remembered the reason for the fight, I shall deservingly sit on the chair of righteousness.  But it's too late, I can't return\r\nback to the way things were because I now live in shame for my vanity.  I've made these mistakes, and now I have to reconcile them without confiding\r\nin the ones I've loved, I have to do it myself(or with God).  I've become a hardened person fighting this war. I've lost the ability to feel.\r\nPlease excuse me while I fight my inner demons so that I can save myself from making anyone else a hardened person.  So I seek emotional shelter while\r\nI recover from the trauma of fighting, until I've cleansed myself of the demons(little metal things coming out of the kid's ear, unconsciousness is the \r\nwall in this case).  The war in my mind continues, I have to fight these demons before it's too late and I can never feel emotion again.  Mama, they try \r\nand break me while I cleanse myself of these inner demons.  They try, but I will put up my best fight.  Even if I fail, at least I've tried.

The window burns means that this person, be it a soldier, or just someone who is losing everything and wants to go home, wants to still be welcome back home.  People leave lights on when they know someone is going to be coming, like on halloween, when you're willing to have kids come and trick or treat your house, you put a jackolantern out, a light.  the idea is that if there is a light on, then the people are still thinking of you and expecting you to come back.  The next line, a flame that warms no matter where they've gone, is talking about the comfort given by knowing that light is on.  The candle in the window, although not giving any actual warmth to speak of, still comforts that person, and it doesn't matter how far away that candle is.  and the can you hear your babies' cryin line is asking if they can simpathize with him.

I think Jaymz has done a massive job with the lyrics. To put forward such a point [for eg. breinholtz' excerpt from Encycmet.com] is putting forward a massive messege to everyone. This point can be further emphisized by simply looking at the line \"Mama they're trying to break me\" and the title \"Hero of the Day\". Normally, kids believe in superheros. You would expect a kid to call their superheroes to help them in trouble. But if a kid is hurt in anyway they dont call their superheroes. They call their mothers. This song kinda emphisizes on how Jaymz felt about his mother later in his life.

Over the past 8 years there have been almost 90 responses and they all basically take one of three interpretations, the anti-war, the child finding his own way and the hero in the media versions.  What gets me is that all three of the positions are defended with the same quotes, just from a different perspectve, so who is really right?  While I have my own feelings on the meaning of the song, I also like to think that everyone is right, because the song never comes out and directly says anything, which is the beauty of a well written song, or even music in general.  It is completely open to interpretation and the desiding factor in what a song means is someones own personal experiences or opinions, even if that differs from what the song means to the band.  I read in some of the early responses that James' brother was a protester of the Veitnam war, so that might be a scourse of inspiration for the song, but the music video obviousely has the theme of short lived heros in the media, so even the guys that wrote the song have at least two interpretations of the song and I have a hard time imagining that one person is right or wrong with one interpretation when the masterminds are split in opinion, both of which are different from my personal feelings on the song.  Regardless of what your views are regarding the songs meaning, I think that one thing we all can agree on is that songs like this one are the reason that we all love music enough to write blogs on individual songs and their meanings, so keep doing what y'all are doing and never stop loving it\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_91": "\nThis song is obviously about war, the Vietnam war maybe, the soldier is writing home, ie mamma they try and break me, his mother leaves a candle on the window to light the way back home safely.

Candles placed in the window during the holidays represent love ones off at war. It is a light that burns to light the way back home. \n\r\n>They're off to find the hero of the day\r\n>But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?\n\r\nIn wars fought by American soldiers it is a rule that you never leave a soldier behind, not even if he has died. This is to keep morale up. The enemy could parade a dead body around or even torture a person to gain intel. Often these rescue missions are very very dangerous and involve returning to hostile territory. \n\n\r\n>Still the window burns\r\n>Time so slowly turns\r\n>Someone there is sighing\r\n>Keepers of the flames\r\n>Do you feel your name?\r\n>Did you hear your babies crying?\n\r\nthese two rhyming triplets show us the person or family at home, still tending to the candle in the window, anxiously awaiting the return of their loved ones. The possibility of their death is disconcerting but the family at home is very powerless in this situation. All they can do is sigh.  \r\nThe last two lines tie into the practice of torturing POW's; a practice very prevalent during Vietnam. Tortured people commonly call to their loved ones in pain and anguish. \n\r\n>Mama, they try and break me\r\n>Still, they try and break me\n\r\nThe purpose of torture is often to \"break\" a persons will and make them disclose information. \n\r\n>Excuse me while I tend to how I feel\r\n>These things return to me that still seem real\n\r\nPost traumatic stress is a disorder caused by traumatic experiences. Rape victims often suffer from it, and tend to seize up or have dreams and intrusive memories of this trauma. The same goes for people who survived wars. \n\r\n>Now, deserving, this easy chair\r\n>But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair\n\r\nVeterans deserve respect and comfort in their civilian life.\n\r\n>Don't want your aid\r\n>But the fist I make\r\n>For years can't hold or feel\r\n>No, I'm not all me\r\n>So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel\n\r\nVeterans can also feel a strong sense of independence due to their experiences and may feel ashamed of receiving help.

This could easily be construed in different ways based upon anyone's situation - depending where you are at in life.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_105": "\nThis song Is awesome, And theres a lot of Great Interpretations,\n(The Soldier with PTSD is my favorite)\n\nBut, I Have an Interpretation of my own.\n\nI think it is about a Teenager that suffers from bullying, and how he deals with it.\n\nWith that said, Im gonna do a full Lyrical Interpretation, So caution, Long post ahead:\n\n\"Mama, they try and break me\"\n\nApparently, This teenager suffers from bullying, and he tries to tell his mother.\n\n\"The window burns to light the way back home\nA light that warms no matter where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone\"\n\nHe is just waking up with the sunlight, On a new day\n\n\"They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re off to find the hero of the day\nBut what if they should fall by someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wicked way?\"\n\nHe is told by his parents that he has great potential, Hence the term \"The Hero of the Day\", and should recieve the new day with joy.\nBut since he suffers from bullying, He feels that he will be stopped.\n\n\"Still the window burns\nTime so slowly turns\nAnd someone there is sighing\"\n\nHe just waits for time to pass, Nervous of the abuse he suffers\n\n\"Keepers of the flames\nDo you feel your name?\nDid you hear your babies crying?\"\n\nHe tries to tell  his parents about his problem,\nOnly to be Ignored.\n\n\"Mama, they try and break me\nStill they try and break me\"\n\nHe tells his mother about his bullying problem,\nHoping to be paid attention.\n\n\"Excuse me while I tend to how I feel\nThese things return to me that still seem real\"\n\nHe now reserves the problem to himself, Knowing that he will be ignored,\nAnd he now suffers anxiety, knowing he will get bullied in school\n\n\"Now, deservingly, this easy chair\nBut the rocking stopped by wheels of despair\"\n\nThe few moments of joy he gets,\nOnly for them to be ruined by the bullies\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want your aid\nBut the fist I make\nFor years can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold or feel\"\n\nHe wants to stand against the bullies,\nSince no one else wants to help him\n\n\"No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not all me\nSo please excuse me while I tend to how I feel\"\n\nPeople start to notice his changing behaviour, \nBut he tells them that he is Ok and to leave him alone\n\n\"But now the dreams and waking screams\nThat ever last the night\"\n\nThe anxiety is now provoking him insomnia and nightmares\n\n\"So build the wall, behind it crawl\nAnd hide until it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light\nSo can you hear your babies crying now?\"\n\nHis parents start to notice his changing behaviour,\nAnd how he is now more quiet and distant\n\n\"Still the window burns\nTime so slowly turns\nAnd someone there is sighing\"\n\nHe now spends his days in total anxiety, sighing to vent his fear\n\nKeepers of the flames\nCan't you feel your names?\nCan't you hear your babies crying?\n\nHe cant believe his parents arent paying attention to him\nAnd that is making him suffer.\n\n\"But now the dreams and waking screams\nThat ever last the night\"\n\nHis anxiety now cant let him sleep\n\n\"So build a wall, behind it crawl\nAnd hide until it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light\nSo can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear your babies crying now?\"\n\nHis parents finally decide to ask him what is happenning to him.\nThey finally hear their baby crying.\n\n\"Mama, they try and break me\nMama, they try and break me\nMama they try\nMama they try\"\n\nHe breaks down to his mother,\nHe tells her all that he suffers,\nhe can finally vent all the suffering and anger.\nHe is now heard.\n\nWell, that was my interpretation, thanks for your time \n\nMETALLICA ROCKZ!!!!!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_106": "\nwell in honesty if you know anything about sumeria history you know metallica and many other bands point to everoyne living in a lie\n\n The window burns to light the way back home\nA light that warms no matter where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone\n\n= nibiru \n\na star in the sky warms no matter how far away\n\nif you think im full of shit read about ENKI and his trip to find gold on earth and then listen to Unforgiven 3\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_107": "\nIt could be about parents losing their children to the darkside of this world and they are hoping they just come home the light is on and leads the way. It's like it could be drug related...hide behiND the wall..hide til it's light..to live another day...almost..can you hear your babies crying..meaning the persons son or daughter is living a life of agony..mama they try to break me could mean they as in they as in whatever is or has influenced their destructive desires.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_108": "\nI think these are Metallica's best lyrics. Everyone shits all over Load for \"selling out\" but this album had the best lyrics in Metallica's entire career; poetic, meaningful, beautiful, even haunting in certain songs. Tracks like \"Aint My Bitch\" and \"Ronnie\" are exceptions, but the rest of the album mostly contains amazing lyricsmanship.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_109": "\nIt always reminds me of Lord of the Rings!
