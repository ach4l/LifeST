In my town a guy named Nate saved one of his buddies and tried to save another one when they're boat capsized in rough water in the harbor. One of them survived with frostbite, the other died of hypothermia and other complications. Nate's body wasn't found. I know this song is about inner strength. But I always think about him when I hear this song because he helped his buddies get to safety and lost his own life in the process.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nit's great. it talkz about people who don't trust themselves, have no faith and self-confidence, they can search themselves and find that there's a hero inside,a hidden talent, everything...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nwhat ggroessl said was so fricking sad!! *sniffs*\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\ni cant stand mariah carey, but i absolutley love this song!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI think this song isn't about yourself being a hero, I think it is about god being inside of you, and helping you when times are tough.

She was wearing a #23 Wizards jersey, but it was customized at ankle length.  It fit her very tight and her breasts were about to fall outta it. Anyway she sang it beautifully and afterwards MJ gave a speech.  Later Charles Barkley, Magic Johnson and a couple other guys were talkin about it and Magic said Mariah's dress was very 'nice' and another announcer 'u know what was even better then Mariah's dress was Michael Jordan's speech' and Charles Brakley said 'I dont know about that!' LOL Then later on Cheryl Miller asked Tracy McGrady what he thought about the halftime show and he said ''Michael's speech was really touching and 'Hero' was a good song choice and Mariah's dress was reeeeeeeaaaally um pretty, i really liked it alot- the halftime show.\" Then he giggled and blushed a little. I was laughing so hard.  She can sang and her songs are all beautiful and give me cold chills but she do dress like a ho.  No offense :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\n::mad awesome song::\r\nmakes you believe in yourself :o)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\nIt makes me feel good about myself\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nthis song is great its saying that theres a hero in you when you think everythings going wrong you need a hero look inside you and youll find the hero is yourself \n\r\nthats just what i think\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nlove it to death!!!but its so sad :( *tears and small siffs* i wish i could write like that and sing like that but no one beats m.c she is talented!i just got music box its a great album!be sure to pick it up!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nThis song means the world to me, eventhough its not about anybody else, it reminds me of my best friend who has helped me through so many hard times !!\r\nOne of the greatest songs sung !!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_19": "\nHa, there was an event at my college; a girl sang this song amazingly well, and I actually loved it... was annoyed to find out it was originally a Mariah Carey song... oh well, I still like it :]\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_20": "\nwell said leahdelonge, well said.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_21": "\nI love this song it has so much meaning :-)\n\n\n", "comment_22": "\nthis song is one of the best songs i've heard!

It's about being enough \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that everything that we seek already lays inside of us.
