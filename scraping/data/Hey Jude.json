{"comment_0": "\nThis song was written be Paul to Julian, John and Cynthia Lennon's son. \nJohn and Cynthia had just been divorced, and Julian, being young, didn't understand what was happening between his parents, but did feel bad about it. So Paul wrote this song on his way to John's house. So in a way, this song is about divorce. This song was originally titled \"Hey Jules\" because of Julian's nickname, Jules, but Jude naturally sounded better. \nHey Jude was probably one of John's favorite Paul songs.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAH\n\r\nyou all can have your opinions about the song from heroin to jewish people hahahah.\n\r\nbut the song was originally titled \"Hey Jules\" \r\nthe song was written by Paul to help \r\nJulian during his father (john lennon) and mother (cynthia lennon)\n\r\nbut you guys are entertaining.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nFor me this song is about someone, whos struggling to take the leap towards the life he wants to live and hes made for. He found a girl that he desperately wants to be with and he is afraid to make that step towards her. For he always worries about too many things, he carries the world on his shoulders even tho he is not responsible for every problem in the world. I think hes making things too complicated by thinking too much about them. He is adviced to be himself and not act cool in order to win the girl's heart. Also the change towards the desired life is all on his shoulders, saying he alone has the power to get what he seeks. He just has to take that leap.\nThis is what this song means to me, not what McCartney or anybody said what it is about.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nActually, the song was changed twice from Hey Julian to Hey Jules to Hey Jude.

Let me just bore you with a little background.\n\r\nI started writing songs four years ago. Little tunes, nothing big, maybe eight bars long. I could only write four bars at a time because my attention span was so low. Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys worked in the same way. (He, if you are wondering, IS one of the people I look up to as a songwriter). I used to write little snatches of tune, four bars each, when suddenly, out popped an entire tune. I had just finished listening to The Everly Brothers' \"All I Have To Do Is Dream\" (again, pertinent). I thought to myself how I could do it, and in my sleep, I came up with words. Single words at first, then phrases, then sentences at a time.\n\r\nNobody can argue with me where my songwriting inspirations are from. I write down everything. Inspiration, date of authorization, and every single word of the song, in my (very sharp) click-click pencil. My point is, such that the words and the tunes were all documented at the beginning, so after The Beatles' career, some guy went back to Mr. McCartney and asked where every single song came from. The result was A Hard Days Write, but that's not the point. Everything's now been documented. Recording dates, correct to the hour, complete journals, correct with master copies of their complete 13 year schedule from 1957-1970.\n\r\nFrom this, what do I glean?

That's an incredibly superficial outlook.\n\r\nMy guess is that Julian was hurt and angry over his parents' divorce, as well as his father's very open relationship with Yoko Ono. And Paul couldn't stand Yoko and empathized with Julian. So the song is partly for Julian (who was only about 5 at the time) and partly for Paul himself. The lyrics, \"Let her into your heart...Let her under your skin\" probably refer to Yoko: Julian may not like Yoko (as Paul doesn't) but she's the woman in John's life now and both of them have to learn to accept it. Only then can they \"make it better.\"\n\r\nThe warning, \"well you know that it's a fool / who plays it cool / by making his world a little colder\" is probably a warning against the emotional coldness that hurt and anger often create. So he urges Julian (and himself) to \"let it out and let it in,\" i.e., let the pain out and let the healing in. He can't put it on someone else to do that for him or with him (\"someone to perform with\"); he needs to do it himself (\"the movement you need is on your shoulder\").\n\r\nUltimately, it's by accepting the pain and the reality of the situation that it can ever get any better. The more I think about it, the more I think Paul was really writing about himself.

Too bad it didn't last much longer, anyway.\n\r\nJust a personal note: this used to be my \"work up the courage to ask a girl out\" song. I used to play it in the background when I'd call her up.

I submit that this can be proved with mathematical rigor and now propose to do so. Follow this closely. \n\r\nSartwell's First Law: The quality of a rock band is inversely proportional to its pretentiousness. \n\r\nCorollary to Sartwell's First Law: The pretentiousness of a rock band can be expressed as a ratio of its artistic ambition to its artistic accomplishment. For example, on a scale of 1 to 10, the artistic ambition of the band Yes equals 9, its artistic accomplishment 1. This yields a pretentiousness ratio of 9:1, one of the very worst in rock history. \n\r\nThe evaluation of rock music is no longer an impressionistic expression of opinion, but rather a precise, quantitative science. Anyone who disagrees with me from now on is simply irrational. \n\r\nSome quick applications: The Ramones (1:8) are better than the Talking Heads (7:7). Nirvana (3:9) is exactly as good as Pearl Jam (9:3) is bad. The worst music ever made (literally) is art rock: King Crimson (10:1), for example. Early U2 and early Bruce Springsteen, who took what were fundamentally fairly simple ditties and mounted them with an elaborateness usually reserved for Wagnerian opera, are almost unbelievably overrated. \n\r\nAnd finally, the Rolling Stones are much better than the Beatles. \n\r\nNow admittedly, this Stones versus Beatles thing is decades old. But it rages still through the halls of nursing homes the world over. \n\r\nBoth the Stones and the Beatles started out as interpreters of rhythm and blues. They cleaned up African-American music and sold it to the world, a tried and true commercial strategy for white folks throughout the century, from Benny Goodman to Elvis Presley to Vanilla Ice. \n\r\nWhich brings me to: Sartwell's Second Law: The quality of a rock song varies inversely as the square of its distance from the blues. The bluesier the better. \n\r\nThe world's popular music is African-American music because African-American music is extremely intense and powerful. If you're playing music in a European tonal framework, you're not a rock band at all. \n\r\nThe history of rock is the continuation of the history of the blues, both in the way it is made and in the way it is received (by dancing in bars). \n\r\nThe two laws are connected: When was the last time you saw a pretentious blues band? Rock is a traditional, as opposed to an avant-garde, art form. The authenticity of a work of traditional art is measured by the way it venerates and explores the tradition. The authenticity of a work of avant-garde art is measured by the way it destroys or transcends the past. Avant-garde rockers have profoundly misunderstood their form. \n\r\nSomething awful happened to the Beatles about 30 years ago, something that happens to most young rock musicians who achieve extreme success: They mistook themselves for avant-garde artistes. They made, for example, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, a truly bad album. They lost the blues and, to paraphrase Chuck Berry, started sounding like a symphony, a vapid symphony. They went baroque. \n\r\nNow that was exactly what the Stones never did (though there was one scary moment: Their Satanic Majesties Request). They have remained, for much longer than anybody else, a knockdown, straight-ahead basic blues and rock band. Mick Jagger never mistook himself for Luciano Pavarotti or T.S. Eliot. Keith Richards never tried to do anything but make great little riffs. \n\r\nThink about how hard this must have been: You can do anything you want, and instead of making a statement for the ages demonstrating what a profound puppy you really are, you just write another great, simple rock song: \"Beast of Burden,\" say, or \"Rock and a Hard Place,\" or, from their excellent current disk, \"Rough Justice.'' When Bach (10:10) made profound statements for the ages, they stuck. When Emerson, Lake and Palmer (10:1) made profound statements for the ages, they were dated before they were released. \"Twist and Shout\" and other early Beatles songs sound like they were recorded yesterday. But \"For the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" sounds like the relic of an extinct, incomprehensible culture. \n\r\nEverything the Stones have ever done, with the exception of some very early work recorded before they could sing and play competently, holds up beautifully: It's the rock of ages. Albums like \"The Rolling Stones, Now!\" (1964), \"It's Only Rock 'n' Roll\" (1974), \"Undercover\" (1983), and \"A Bigger Bang\" (2005) all sound perfectly fresh. There's a very simple reason for that: They are excellent examples of Sartwell's laws, completely unpretentious and always undergirded by the blues. \n\r\nThe accomplishment of the Stones never exceeds their grasp; they know exactly what they play well, and they just keep on playing it. Do that successfully for a year and, if you're lucky, you've got a good recording and a concert tour to show for it. Do it for 35 years, and you're the only rockers who ever have. \n\r\nSo there you have it: Perfectly irrefragable proof that if you go see the Stones, you'll be seeing the greatest freaking rock band in history. Anybody got an extra ticket?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_121": "\nyoure a great sartwell shit talker\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_122": "\nThe guess here is that the non drug takers would say it's clearly not about Heroin and the current (and thank goodness) one time drug takers are saying it is about dope.\n\r\nWell Paul clearly was a heavy drug user.

I still think \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" was describing an acid trip, regardless of John's protestations. Paul has acknowledged taking pills, pot, cocaine, and acid. He ticked off the other Beatles for talking to reporters about their LSD usage before any of the rest of them did. And yet, he describes himself (and is acknowledged by the others) as having been more reluctant than they were to get into the heavier drugs. He said somewhere that he drew the line at heroin (he was told, \"It's only a problem if you run out of money, and that's no problem for you,\" and thought, no, I don't want any part of that).\n\r\nThe problem I have with \"Hey Jude\" being about heroin is that it makes the singer out not only to be a user but to be a pusher--and a pretty heavy-handed pusher at that. That's not Paul's MO. He had already seen the devastating effect that heroin usage had had on John back in '66 or '67. I just don't think that that was his drug of choice, or that he would write a song pushing it that hard.

'you were made to go out and get her (yoko)'...'fool who plays it cool by making his world a little colder' these definitely evoke Lennon.\n\r\nBut then he sings 'you're waiting for someone to perform with' and then it becomes blatant.

The effect of the song, and particularly the Beatles' recording of it, transcends language, I think.\n\r\nWhat I find particular cool is that the song begins with something very specific, he's singing to a little kid, a lone voice a capella starts..'Hey...' followed by plain piano chords, then some tentative tambourine notes, a heartily strummed acoustic guitar, gradually the band and more reassuring voices join in, John singing harmony with Paul, it becomes really festive, then calamity breaks loose with the double orchestra and the na na na na's....so the song begins as a direct, personal sentiment to a kid, with Paul as a sort of avuncular voice, and then gradually progresses toward a sentiment that is massive and universal, and with every beat the music wonderfully echoes this progression.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_168": "\nI think everybody understands the meaning of this song by now--I hereby declare it casual conversation time.

I mean why would you want to think a song like this is about heroine? I don't know about you but if that was true It would kind of ruin this song for me. but i completely believe that the Julian story is true and by far the best, and back to the lyrics could mean anything...Take any random Beatles song and try to see if it works into your life! Thats exactly what they did in Across The Universe. They used Hey Jude to cheer up Jude in the movie and get him to go back and make things right with his love...so see if you can make Beatles songs fit into your life...when your depressed, happy, in love...anything!

Possibly you might not have spoken much with her, but something caught your eye.  You saw something special.  You might not notice right away, but it bothers you in the back of your mind.

You see how caring and nuturing this girl is.\n\r\nYou were made to go out and get her: Meaning you have some of the best qualities that would truly win over this girls heart.  The girl is the one you know is a soulmate of somekind, but the tension of being so alike makes a challenge.

There are times when you probably won't get what you need. There are going to be times where you a really frustrated and want to throw all your anger on her.  You may be lonely and be spereated from her for long periods of time.  You can't be negative.\n\r\nDon't Carry the World Upon your Shoulders:  Be patient.  You may be in love, but this is going to take time.  You may feel like you have met your best friend ever, but theres only so much you can do about it.  Be smart.\n\r\nDon't be Afraid/Take a sad song and make it better:  This can be a common issue.  It is hard to not be afraid.

Classic.\n\r\n\"For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool,\r\nBy making his world a little colder\"\r\nHere he's telling him that playing it cool and playing the game is not beneficial because it will make his world cold meaning dull and that getting the girl without all that, without her approval and consent aka rape, is what's gonna make his world exciting.\n\r\n\"Hey Jude, don't let me down\r\nYou have found her, now go and get her\r\nRemember to let her into your heart\r\nThen you can start to make it better\"\r\nSame as the lyrics above with different words.\n\r\n\"So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin.\r\nYou're waiting for someone to perform with.\r\nAnd don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do.\r\nThe movement you need is on your shoulder\"\r\nThis is where it's clear. It's so obvious!!! \"Let it out and let it in\"? Seriously? Can you make it more clear? More sexual? Huh, Paul McRapey?\r\nAnd the fact that he basically said \"don't wait for anyone to preform. You need to go and get it and it's all just you and you're the one who needs to do it\"???!! What the actual fuck? He's telling him to ignore the girl's feelings and just do it and do it all himself and that's okay?\n\r\nWhat the actual fuck? Wake up, sheeple! You knew the truth now! There's no excuse for it to continue listening to it and keep it in the legendary and best of songs status!! This is the truth! The Beatles had a lot of hidden evil meanings in their songs and soon people, smart people who are enlightened, will get those meanings and share them with the rest of the blind sheeple. And remember this was written in the late 60s when the freaky sexual culture awoke and began to spread the idea of \"free love\" and all that crap which men created just to get girls get their panties off and have \"free sex\" but they can't say that! They need to hide it into something beautiful like \"free love\" or this ugly and disgusting song. And \"nah nah nah\"? You know what i say to that? Fuck yeah it's nah nah nah for rape!!! Please say and do the same by sharing it with your loved ones so they don't have rape installed in their unconscious by listening to this ugly song. Thank The Lord for all of this.

You are all wrong. This has nothing to do with Julienne Leno or heroines.\n\nThis song is about the relationship between Judas and Jesus, whom Paul McCartney is suggesting was secretly a woman. Jesus (the woman) is trying to seduce Judas, but he is resistant (Remember to let her into your heart). McCartney is also suggesting that Jesus is a lousy singer and performs lousy songs like Amazing Grace (Take a sad song and make it better). He wants Judas to help Jesus sing better and perform less depressing songs. Jesus is also a metaphor for Ringo Starr.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
