{"comment_0": "\nLove this song. Very inspirational. So much historical value.\n\nIt's obviously about not giving up and working hard toward your goals. It presents 2 \"impossible\" things, an ant carrying a rubber tree plant, and a ram punching a hole in a dam. These things are obviously \"impossible\" but then it talks about how through persistence, they were able to accomplish what they were previously told was impossible. This is a perfect campaign theme song for a politician, and it was indeed used by J F Kennedy in his 1960 campaign. It's incredibly easy to surrender to futility against the enormous array of the world's ills. But you have to keep fighting and through persistence, they can indeed be solved.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
