{"comment_0": "\nI believe that this song relates to many Californians, not to say that other cultures or people from different places can't relate to it. What I'm saying, is that this song represents the dream of hollywood handing you everything you could dream for. Yet it asks only for your soul in return.\r\nAs said within the song lyrics, \"when you're rich that you sold yourself for this\", thus showing the meaning of people giving up everything and everyone for a shot at fame and fortune. Yet they don't realize the path that it will lead and how all of it is only a soft, velvet, fading illusion and the moment you touch it, it will dissolve at your fingertips. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI'd like to add that where it says:\n\"So you want to be a rock star\nWith blue eyed bunnies in your bed\nWell remember when you're rich that you sold yourself for this, you'll be famous cause you're dead.\"\nI think he is referring to Kurt Cobain, who received most of his fame after he passed.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
