{"comment_0": "\nThis song is SO beautiful. I think its pretty obvious what the songs about but if you dont think so ill tell you. I think this song is about when you finally leave home and you think your leaving to have an adventure but you find something even better-true love, and when you find that you realize that its what you left to find in the first place. :D\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI'm from a town just south of the Mason Dixon line... I'm wondering if anyone knows how exact this song actually is because I only know of one all night diner in the area and that'd be pretty cool if they actually went there. I love this song. It gave me chills when I heard it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
