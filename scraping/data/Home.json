I love more deeply, I care more about people, I feel healed of hurts and disappointments that I could never seem to move past, until I knew her.\n\nNeither of us ever wanted to hurt the ones that we loved before we met, and still love now. We keep in touch in a light, conversational way, when we can, because it's just not appropriate to be as close as we once were.
