Could \"Arkansas\" and \"South Carolina\" have worked as well?  Or, shouldn't the girl be MISSissippi?  And \"I\" (the singer) be LOUISiana? \n\r\nIs there a special relationship, a history, between the states of Mississippi and Louisiana that I don't know about?  \n\r\nA really fun, breezy, summery song, of course.   It just sends me off on that tangent when I hear it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis is one of my favorite country love songs.It's too sweet(no pun intended).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nHe's saying he really likes this girl.\r\nEither that or he reads the animorphs books.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nLast summer a girl in my school was killed in a car accident she knew everyone and was apart of the senior class this year so it was really sad. As graduation rolled around the broadcasting program at school made a video for us seniors and at the end of the video was a part for her and they played this song it was so sweet there wasn't a person who didn't have tears in their eyes. She was our honey bee and she finally got her wings. I love this song. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
