The kid, declaring himself a true Tool fan (OGT - Original Gangsta Tool) apparently called MJK a sellout for releasing Undertow, a major label record.  Maynard turns his words around into the chorus that says, \"We all participate in capitalism, so by saying you don't like it, you're being hypocritical.\"  He goes on to say that the kid knows nothing about him except for what Maynard lets him know, so he's in no position to tell him how to live.

Honestly, we as fans dont truly know the individuals writing and recording these songs, and I think the point of this entire song is that whether or not TOOL sold out or not is irrelevent because the music that they write and produce continues to be amazing and what we the consumer want more and more of. Honestly, there people just like everyone else. They believe what they want and leave the rest up to the individual to believe what they want. At the end of the day, there pretty awesome and create well thought out and well put togethor music that we all love and enjoy.

There may be a message, but that message is only a secondary purpose for making this song.\n\r\nMJK is a sell-out. Every musician is a sell-out. The main reason to pick up their instruments or pull out their pen in the first place is so they can earn money. They care more about surviving by earning money than entertaining you. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good to know you entertain people too. Take a look at that \u00c3\u0086nima CD and picture this. That isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t piece of art full of deep meaning, that is a product used to make MJK money. In our society, everything is a product. That monitor in front of you. The designer of that created it for the purpose of making money. That table, that TV, that lamp, that window, your house, everything you eat. Everything is a product designed for the fundamental purpose to make the creator money. The news doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report stuff you need to know, it reports stuff you will be interested so you will tune in so companies will give them money for advertising space so you will know about their products so you can buy.\n\r\nIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to feed \u00e2\u0080\u0098the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in any way and not be a sell-out.

On one hand, he's a strong defender of a musician's right not only to make music as he or she sees fit, but also to sell it and profit from it. He's said so himself in at least one interview, strongly, and the lyrics of this song certainly imply it. So he's angry with this kid for not respecting that right of the artist. On the other hand, it sounds like he is indeed angry with that part of himself and the system. The lyrics also seem to form an indictment of the music industry itself, and the hell musicians go through to reach success, and how little that translates into respect for themselves or their art. He also seems, at least in part, to despise the pressures financial gain put on art.

Anywho, so many people I know (not on here, but in reality) immediately dismiss this song for being \"fucking stupid\" or only laugh at the profanities. But the fact of the matter is, this song is the work of Maynard James Keenan's lyrical genius. It is obviously about an encounter he had with a boy who claimed to be a \"true\" Tool fan, dressed in a fittingly ironic inauthenticity, who accused Maynard of \"selling out\". There are awesome meanings in the profane lines, for instance, the chorus; \"I'm the man, and you're the man, and he's the man as well, so you can point that fucking finger up your ass\". It shows how each and every one of us is a cog in the capitalist system, and as a result of that, every single one of us is the famed \"man\" who is always out to get us. And the \"point that fucking finger up your ass\" is obviously a blatant fuck-off that basically screams \"I win, you lose. Bitch.\" Also, a thought on the title; a possibility as to why the song is titled \"Hooker With A Penis\" could be that the piercings, tattoos and other nuances of the boy's appearance made him look so ridiculous, that he almost looked feminine, or like a hooker with a penis.

The obvious meaning is that Maynard hates sell outs and people who think they are non-conformist while actaully conform and just fake people in general.  He says \"I sold out long before you ever heard my name/I sold my soul to make a record\". What I didn't get was why he would call himself a sell out b/c he hates them so much. I think this song is also a reaction to all those ppl who are like \"Maynard is God\" and that he sees himself like a Hooker With a Penis b/c he is only human and not a god at all. He wants people to think for themselves, but they just listen to him w/o questioning him, which he doesn't like. I am putting words in his mouth though, thats just my interpretation of the song.\r\nOh and it would be hilarious if some commented like \"hey, i met maynard wearing Vans, 501s, and a\r\nDope Beastie tee, nipple rings, and new tattoos, told him i was OGT and bought his 1st EP back in '92 and told him he was a sell out between sips of Coke.

Cracks me up everytime I hear it.  There are very few bands that could get away with these lyrics.  I don't see how anyone could be exclusively an OGT.  I enjoy Opiate as much as the next guy, but it is far from their best stuff.  I would rate Jerk Off as one of their best though.  That scream at the end (live mind you) is insanely wicked to the wicked degree.  \n\r\nIf they truly sold out, they would pump out a new album every year or two instead of every 4 or 5 years.  You know Adam could easily have his own silverburst line of guitars.  Heck, everyone one of those guys could have their name on something with the snap of their fingers.  Additionally, their music would gradually suck more and more, which has not happened.  In a day with so few decent bands, it's hard to call Tool sellouts.
