It features one of the coolest guitar solos of that time period.  The Elvis version is a more hyperactive version of the song.  No less or better than the original in my opinion just different.  It rocks.  Watching Elvis do the \"raunchy\" version on that old tv show was certainly a big moment in rock and roll history.  I think it's one of the coolest things I've ever seen.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThe Elvis version is good in its own respects, but nothing compares to the Mama Thorton version. That is AMAZING!

It is possible that if he has some sort of medical condition or mutation which means that he has no tear ducts, and if he has lived an entirely solitary life then he may not realise that human beings are capable of crying, but that he has seen a dog cry before. This is how he mistakes a human being for a species of dog, having seen very few human beings, let alone one in distress enough to cry.\n\tIt is the next section of this song that is considered the most controversial and dubious of all, as the singer refers to his misidentified subject as having never caught a rabbit and not being as friend of his. It has long been a debate amongst musicologists about whether the man who is misidentified as being a canine was not his friend to begin with, or whether being his friendship is subject to having caught a rabbit. May this debate continue for many years.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nevery time I want to write something, but I'm afraid because I do not speak English particularly well, so that once I am sorry for the mistakes\nabout this song, t is unclear how plainly perceive it, and so I had the idea that since the song was originally written on behalf of the on behalf of the woman that threw a man (played by Big Mama Thornton), the most natural way take it like a song\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character was thrown by the girl, and he sing that was said to him, and then a little bitchy manner of performance of Elvis become justified\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nLots of people cry just to get their way.
