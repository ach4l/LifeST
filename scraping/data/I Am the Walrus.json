And, the letter said that they were analyzing the lyrics of his songs in class.  So, John wrote the nonsensical I Am The Walrus, largely based on The Walrus & The Carpenter by Lewis Carroll.  It has been said that some of the lines were written by John under the influence of LSD, but Paul had nothing to do with it.  It was John scribbling on scrap paper (I believe some of the handwritten lyrics to this song were auctioned off a couple years back).  Semolina Pilchard, by the way, was a combination of two names of nasty foods John remembers eating as a child.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nJohn wrote this song and said,\" If Bob Dylan can write this crap, so can I.\" Just if anyone was wondering.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI read in a book once that this song was John's answer to all the people interpreting his songs because \"it doesn't mean anything\".  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nit is true that the Beatles deliberately put hidden messages and meanings in their album covers and lyrics and recordings just to keep their fans frothing at the mouth.\n\r\nthe Beatles never took themselves seriously.  their music may have taken a serious tone by the time Sgt Pepper was done, but the Beatles never took themselves seriously as a band.  \n\r\nJohn, for one, resented all the hype and worked feverishly toward the end of the Beatles' career (along with Yoko) to destroy any little box the media and the fans tried to put them in.\n\r\n\"I Am the Walrus\" was based on Carroll's \"The Walrus & The Carpenter\" as Jabbatut pointed out, but was more along the lines of Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" in terms of nonsense.\n\r\nthe lyrics all have some foundation in Lennon's childhood and early adult life pre-Beatles.\n\r\nthe lyric about the Eggman is supposedly about Eric Burdon, of fellow Brit band the Animals (House of the Rising Sun).  Eric Burdon apparently liked to involve eggs in the bedroom, and John was taking the piss out of him.  the Eggmen would be the rest of the Animals.\n\r\nand yes, tho debatable, it does sound as if there is a crowd chanting \"Smoke pot, Smoke Pot, Everybody Smoke pot\" in the background.  \n\r\nalso amidst the flurry of voices in the end of the song you can hear the Beatles singing the lyrics from their past hits, which is something they did quite often!\n\r\nJohn actually wrote the song after he found out a class at an English University was started for the sole purpose of deciphering the Beatles' lyrics.\n\r\nreportedly, after recording the song, Lennon smiled to producer George Martin and said, \"There, let those buggers figure that one out.\"\n\n\n\n", "comment_5": "\njohn wrote the two first lines on two separate acid trips the rest of it was a bunch of random stuff just to piss off people trying to find meaning in his songs including part of a nursery rime he got from a friend (Pete Shotton)\"yellow matter custard\" etc.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\na philosophy for life: everyone in their lifetime is at one point the walrus, the eggman, and even.. the goo goo goo joob. so i suppose the walrus is the leader, the eggman is the follower, and the goo goo goo joob is just undecided. this song holds all the answers.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nOk, and Paul was supposedly dead because he wasn't wearing shoes on the cover of an album, and Come Together was supposed to mean at his funeral.  MAybe people should stop trying so hard to find 'hidden meanings' and stop playing their music backwards looking for little things that really aren't there.

But then again, the meaning could have come out of his subconscious.   If you watch the video and listen to the words, you hear a lot of tongue and cheek, but then again, there's the persistent theme of trying to understand a complicated society.   In the end, you could hear what sounds like John saying, \"I educate myself.\"    John said similar comments about another Beatle song, but watching him sing, he's clearly trying to convey a message.    So in a nutshell, I believe the song is about a brilliant mind trying to grasp meaning to a complicated society; his spirit very active amidst the confusion.   Perhaps Mr. Lennon might agree to that one?

This angered Lennon because he felt this was much better. \r\nLennon wrote most of this while tripping on acid. The up and down rhythm was inspired by a police siren he heard. \r\nLennon made sure the lyrics didn't make sense so he could confuse all the people trying to analyze his songs. He got the idea for the oblique lyrics when he received a letter from a student who explained that his English teacher was having the class analyze Beatles songs. Lennon answered the letter; his reply was sold as memorabilia at a 1992 auction. (thanks, Emery - San Jose, CA) \r\nThe voices at the end are from a BBC broadcast of the Shakespeare play King Lear. \r\nThe idea for the Walrus came from the poem The Walrus and The Carpenter from Alice in Wonderland. In his 1980 Playboy interview, Lennon said: \"It never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system. I never went into that bit about what he really meant, like people are doing with the Beatles' work. Later, I went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy. I thought, Oh, s--t, I picked the wrong guy. I should have said, 'I am the carpenter.' But that wouldn't have been the same, would it?\" \r\nWhen Lennon decided to write confusing lyrics, he asked his friend Pete Shotton for a nursery rhyme they used to sing. Shotton gave them this rhyme, which Lennon incorporated into the song:\r\n\"Yellow matter custard, green slop pie, all mixed together with a dead dog's eye.\r\nSlap it on a butty, ten foot thick, then wash it all down with a cup of cold sick.\" \r\nThe song's opening line, \"I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together\" is based on the song \"Marching To Pretoria,\" which contains the lyric, \"I'm with you and you're with me and we are all together.\" (thanks, bertrand - Paris, France, for above 3) \r\nThe choir at the end sings \"Oompah, oompah, stick it in your jumper\" and \"Everybody's got one, everybody's got one.\" \r\nThis song helped fuel the rumor that Paul McCartney was dead. It's quite a stretch, but theorists found these clues in the lyrics, none of which are substantiated:\r\n\"Waiting for the van to come\" means the 3 remaining Beatles are waiting for a police van to come. \"Pretty little policemen in a row\" means policemen did show up.\r\n\"Goo goo ga joob\" were the final words that Humpty Dumpty said before he fell off the wall and died.\r\nDuring the fade, while the choir sings, a voice says \"Bury Me\" which is what Paul might have said after he died.\r\nDuring the fade, we hear someone reciting the death scene from Shakespeare's play \"King Lear.\" (thanks, Tommy - flower mound, TX) \r\nThe BBC banned this for the lines \"pornographic priestess\" and \"let your knickers down.\" \r\nLennon got the line \"Goo Goo Ga Joob\" from the book Finnegan's Wake by James Joyce. \r\nIn The Beatles song \"Glass Onion,\" Lennon sang, \"The Walrus was Paul.\" He got a kick out of how people tried to interpret his lyrics and figure out who the Walrus was. \r\n\"Semolina Pilchard\" was Detective Sergeant Norman Pilcher, head of the Scotland Yard Drugs Unit. He led the arrests of both John Lennon and Brian Jones et al, before being investigated himself for blackmail and bribery in the '70s. (thanks, Matt - London, England) \r\nEric Burdon (of Animals and War fame) stated in his biography that he is the Egg Man. It seems he told John Lennon of a sexual experience he was involved in where an egg played a major part. After that, John called him Egg Man. \r\nELO's song \"Hello My Old Friend\" has an identical form to this - almost the same tune and orchestration but different words. No wonder Jeff Lynne is sometimes referred to as the 6th Beatle. \r\nIn the Anthology version of this song, they experiment with 4 octaves in the intro. Also, just before Lennon says, \"Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun,\" Ringo does 2 hits on snare and floor tom before hitting crash. (thanks, Riley - Elmhurst, IL) \r\nIn an episode of The Simpsons, \"The Bart Of War,\" airing May 18, 2003, Bart and Milhouse break into a secret room in the Flanders' household to discover that Ned is a Beatles fanatic. Bart takes a sip from a can of 40-year-old Beatles-themed novelty soda and quotes this song: \"Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye,\" while Milhouse takes a trip and sees various Beatles inspired hallucinations. (thanks, Ashley - Moncton, Canada) \r\nStyx covered this song in 2004.

Somebody looked into a song a bit too far, The Beatles got wind of it, and went with it. Here's what I know about the whole thing:\r\nApparently, the cover of Sgt. Pepper's album is supposed to be Paul's funeral, atleast that's what I've heard. And if you hold a mirror in the right spot on the bass drum in the middle, there's supposed to be an arrow that points to Paul and it should read \"he died\" or something like that. Paul's hand is on Ringo's shoulder (the clay figures), to comfort him...On the back cover, paul is the ONLY one that is standing with his back towards us. signifying him being dead (not sure how, but it does). In the Magical Myserty Tour movie, there's a scened where they're all singing and dancing and Paul has a black rose on his jacket, also signifying his death. To go back to the comment someone made about Paul being the man that died in the car, and that he was looking at a meter made, the meter made was Lovely Rita.\r\nThe Abbey Road cover...The license plate on the VW Beetle reads \"LMW(which I haven't heard has any meaning) 28 IF\" The 28 IF supposedly means that Paul would have been 28 if he was still alive.

I will try to put his words down well enough to seem as clear as he did.\r\nThe first part, \" I am he...\" has four pronouns, and four lines. There were four Beatles.  They are the \"pigs from a gun\", since everywhere they went they had to run, or fly to, since Beatlemania was in full effect. A cornflake is a very fragile thing, and sitting on it would cause it to break.  Fame is very fragile, and one false move could make or break your career. The next part refers to the various media events the Beatles were always a part of, like TV, radio, etc. Since they were first a \"boyband\", their sponsers always wanted them to be cheery and fun. John was not one to smile, hence the\"face grown long\", and would have a fake grin when asked to smile. \r\nThe eggman part my teacher could not explain, just that they were like milkmen, and the walrus is a figure of death.\r\n\"Mr. City policeman sitting pretty little policeman in a row\", refers to how the police would stand in a row to block the fans when the Beatles made an appearance. He skipped to the \"Pornographic Priestess\", which was a reference to the groupies that were all over them.\r\nThe whole stanza about the \"English tan\" means that they made the best of their situation, regardless of what others did.\r\n\"Expert texpert choking smokers\" is an English reference to the old Englishmen who read the news of the Beatles fame, and laughed, because he knew they were not free individuals, but just receipts to the big moneymakers behind the scenes, which is the reason that they are crying throughout the song. Last, \"kicking Edgar Allen Poe\" meant that now the Beatles were trying to be considered serious, and acknowledged as writers.\r\nNow, my teacher admits this song is about nothing like John said, but they probably put in personal experiences and little references when in a daze of writing.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_126": "\n\"I am he, as you are he, as you are me, and we are all together\"\n\r\nQuite possibly the greatest lyric ever written.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_127": "\nhehehe i bet the beatles had such a laugh coming up with these lyrics and sending out.

The point is people always think there is one big hidden meaning behind everything, therefore they made a song that could be looked at at so many different angles that it was impossible to figure out which meaning was the real one! I bet they had some great times listening to all the theories that people came up with about the song and i'm sure they came up with a few after they'd released it!

I'm no expert on the Beatles, yet, but i'm going to go ahead and say that they had no idea how much f***ing meaning this song has or how important it would be in that it is pop culture WITH VALUE. There's a shock. Yes it can happen, wasn't shakespeare considered pop culture in his time? ----hang on---- TheRighteous(i just read your post) I think your teacher did an excellent job of understanding the personal experiences of the beatles that led to those exact lyrics\r\nbut,\r\nhe failed to see the larger picture. These guys are perfect examples of what happens to a person whom----this is difficult for me to define (I need to improve my vocabulary)----a person whom turns their back on life is one way to say it albeit quite vague. These guys are not happy, they're using drugs, they would rather misunderstand the world around them than face up to the truth. They express this in their songs, if you think they are encouraging drug use you are in denial my friend. It's more than just the drugs, however, the drugs are just crutches on which they support their broken spirits because they are not whole. I'm only beginning to get back on the true path myself. I hit some major bumps in the road to becoming an honest and emphatic person. Things like being influenced by troubled people and caring for them and trusting them to my own detriment. Using Pot, which i will never touch again. And eventually closing up emotionally until recently. It isn't always easy opening yourself up to people. Conflicts happen. Lately i find it scary how well i can read people from their talk and how they move even, because i don't like what i see around me. There are a lot of troubled kids where i go to college and i find that I can be exhausted by it all. I'm the type of person who doesn't like to see others in pain. And when i say troubled i mean these people have emotional problems regardless of economic status or what have you. I wish i was in a position to make some major changes in our society because if someone doesn't soon i fear that the situation will only worsen. It can be so very hard for some people to change. I've learned that you can't force a person to correct upon his/her mistakes, one can only show him or her the way and hope that they can come to a self-realization that they need to change themselves. This becomes more difficult as time drags on. I believe everyone has the potential to be a good person if they are strong enough to be themselves! Say what you really mean and mean what you say. Keep your eyes open and pay attention to the world around you. Form your own principles and values and believe in them as well as yourself. Listen to John Lennon in Imagine, live for every friggin day. We're all going to die someday, don't count on a form of eternal existence, live it now! Help others, love others, fall in love. Live well and die well. But don't forget that rationale and common sense etc. are necessary tools in life. A balance must be found between reason and feeling.\n\r\nI mentioned many different things here but they all tie in to the song if you think about it =D.\r\nThis is the first time i've posted anything like this on the internet, I wonder if i'm making any sense? Regardless i'm glad i got these thoughts out with a possibility of someone understanding them, because they would definitely would be wasted on my room mate. He's one of the aforementioned people i can't help and although i hate to do it I will be kicking him out soon.\r\nOh quick note to anime fans out there i believe certain series such as neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon convey messages similar to my personal realizations.\r\nLast thing i promise, I just saw One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Great Movie. Not only is it funny and shows so many sides of human nature, not only is it sad, it's also ties in to my point! The indian guy, chief, finally musters the determination to live his life by the end of the movie-Hurray!\r\nOk i'm done. I successfully de-stressed myself today between talking with my parents, listening to the beatles, reading a new book (Eldest) a little more humor in it would have been good but cool nonetheless, movie, beer (I only had one can) i'm not a complete boyscout after all, and this post. Should be fun to see what happens if anyone bothers to read all this (maybe i should have kept it more to the point with less free association?)\r\n-To the Beatles- No offense intended to them, From the songs i've heard they sound like good-hearted people and possibly reflected back on their lives in a similar manner.\n\r\nI'd like to say thank you for reading this and I wish you a good life.\r\nGoodnight\r\n-Marco\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_131": "\nHello again and good morning.\r\nI thought a bit about the lyrics this morning and after listening to the song again I realized that the lyrics directly support my claims.\r\nOk the first part-I'm skipping the all together part for now. \r\nSee how they run \r\nlike pigs from a gun\r\nsee how they fly. I'm crying.\r\nMy point is made clear right away look at the association right there. They run and he's crying and they are also he right? so he runs, they all run, and he's crying. But what do they run from exactly or why?\r\nThe answer is simple. They are running from themselves. They are running from truly feeling, from being honest about themselves and who they are and who they would like to be. He's the walrus, norwegian death symbol eh? If lennon had that association then he is saying that he is dead, symbolically. Paul is dead huh? I think that whole deal meant that Paul had changed in the eyes of the other Beatles. The old Paul is/was \"dead\" and a new, changed Paul was born, for better or worse i don't know, I don't know much about the Beatles' history, yet.\r\nok next, \r\ni am the eggman they are the eggmen\r\nI associate the egg as something fragile, breakable, hardened on the outside with soft mushy yolk on the inside. Humpty Dumpty comes to mind, he is an eggman after all. whoa, i just looked up humpty dumpty on wikipedia and that led me to Lewis Carrol's Jabberwocky. I can tell there is much to be discovered in there and much emotion although the new language makes it difficult to understand perhaps thats what the guy needed because he felt plain words were inadequate to express himself. There's a fiery eyes line in there, that was used in another beatles song connected to the paul is dead thing right? if so then lennon or the beatles were familiar with the poem and probably with humpty dumpty as well since he is connected to that through alice in wonderland translating the jabberwocky.\r\n-Fascinated with lewis carrol after reading bio, will soon begin extensive research\r\nAlright so where was I? Oh humpty dumpty alright so in the poem it never says he is an egg right? It is stated that he is an egg after the reciter of the poem asks about it. So this guy was a weak person, no determination, he experienced some type of trauma that he or she, ahem, could not handle and he broke, psychologically, and no one could help put him back together. He was too far gone, too much time spent off the correct path fearing understanding. So lennon being the egg man fits in with the rest of what i'm saying.\r\nI caught a bit of penny lane a few minutes ago while writing this about keeping a clean machine, was this someone in the group abstaining from drugs? What's the song about, is it about someone falling in love with a girl? If so that would make sense since love is the most powerful healing force.\r\nThere's more in the song to support me but i need a break for now. Laps in the pool and more research on Lewis Carrol for me If i wasn't in the middle of two books i'd go buy at least the alice books right now, ah maybe later.\r\nFarewell\r\n-Marco\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_132": "\nIf you reverse the chanting at the end it sounds (quite clearly actually) like \"Ha Ha, Paul is Dead\".

Here is the situation as I know it; John wrote the first few lines on acid and the rest of the song was loosely based on Lewis Carroll's 'The Walrus and the Carpenter'. John originally thought the walrus was the good guy but later learned he was the one who wanted to eat the oysters. (I think it was oysters, I don't really remember) Aside from that, it didn't really have a planned meaning. Also, I'm pretty sure John Lennon said 'Let the fuckers figure that one out' to Pete Shotton, not George Martin or Paul McCartney, but I could be wrong. It's all in 'The Beatles Anthology'. \r\nA lot of people looked for 'Paul is dead' clues in this one and some thought the walrus was some ancient symbol of death, which is really stupid. They thought this because in 'Glass Onion', John wrote 'the walrus was Paul' but he only wrote it because he was considering leaving the group (he started thinking about leaving the group, so stop blaming Yoko Ono, people!) and he felt bad about ditching Paul so he started letting him have little things. Again it's all in 'The Beatles Anthology', which is a giant book written by the Beatles and taken from interviews and stuff.\r\nAnd benniegirl19 is wrong about the goo goo g'joob being the wrong spelling because I have the record 'Magical Mystery Tour' and the lyrics are printed on it.

Firstly, if you listen to the song Glass Onion on the White Album, the song reveals that the \"Walrus was Paul\". The Walrus is evidently referring to the Lewis S. Carroll story \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\" in which the Wlarus and the Carpenter lure young innocent oysters to be eaten. The Walrus, howerver, feels immense remorse for his actions. Also, in the cover of the Magical Mystery Tour, under the song title there is handwriting \"no you're not!\" Said Little Nicola. I believe that this is stating that the Walrus was not John, and that he was alluding to Paul being the Walrus. I believe it is showing that the oysters are the fans being lured to believe Paul is dead, and that Paul feels remorse for having tricked so many of their fans. I don't think they would reference a song in later tracks if it didn't mean anything....especially in the track Glass Onion which means a see-through coffin (possibly mocking the Paul is Dead Controversy).\n\r\nI'm never set in my ways and any other ideas on the song are greatly appreciated as I like to read into the meanings of their songs and develop some ideas myself.

And the quotation from Shakespear's \"King Lear\" is the from the death scene of a traitor, late in the play.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:\n\r\nOn the Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) All the people are looking at a freshly dug grave.\n\r\n2.) Paul is holding the musical instrument cor anglais, and it is black, symbolizing death, and the only Beatle holding a black instrument. Where Paul is holding it with his left hand (being left-handed) he is displaying three fingers, meaning only three Beatles left?\n\r\n3.) This was the first album on Apple Records and the first album that the group wrote their name as \"Beatles,\" rather than \"The Beatles.\" This is inferred to mean that they are no longer a whole as in \"The,\" but now since there are only three, it is just \"Beatles.\"\n\r\n4.) The yellow hyacinth in the shape of a left-handed guitar only has three strings.\n\r\n5.) The doll in the red, black and white stripes has a car model on her lap next to her right hand. This model with red interior is supposed to mean the car in which Paul was killed and the red interior is blood.\n\r\n6.) The other three Beatles' are standing sideways behind the drum, except Paul who is standing forward.\n\r\n7.) On the drum is written in the center \"Lonely Hearts.\" Using a mirror, place it perpendicular to the center of the drum. Splitting the words \"Lonely Hearts\" in half, the combined writing reads - 1 ONE 1 X HE DIE. This means that the \"1 One 1\" equal three, or that Paul is gone, and the \"X\" is meant to cross out Paul. Between the words \"HE\" and \"DIE\" is an arrow that points directly to Paul.\n\r\n8.) The hand raised over Paul's head, is to mean \"death.\"\n\r\nThe Back Cover:\n\r\n1.) Paul is facing the back, which can mean that he is an imposter, or that he is dead.\n\r\n2.) George's right-hand index finger is pointing directly to the words \"five o'clock,\" the supposed time of the car crash.\n\r\n3.) That the song lyrics \"Within You, Without You,\" are printed over Paul's body.\n\r\nThe Songs:\n\r\n1.) Lovely Rita:\"When I caught a glimpse of Rita,\" and \"I took her home, I nearly made it.\"\n\r\n2.) A Day In The Life: \" He blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had changed. A crowd of people stood and stared, they'd seen his face before...\" \n\r\n3.) Good Morning, Good Morning: \"Nothing to do to save his life.\" \"People running around it's five o'clock.\" \n\r\n4.) She's Leaving Home: \"Wednesday morning at five o'clock.\"\n\r\n5.) Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: The reference to Billy Shears is supposed to be that of William (Billy) Campbell, the look-alike.\n\r\nMagical Mystery Tour\n\r\nThe Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) Paul is alleged to be the one in the \"black\" walrus suit.\n\r\n2.) In the booklet, Ringo's drums read \"Love the 3 Beatles.\"\n\r\n3.) In the picture where The Beatles' are wearing white tails, Paul is the only one with a black carnation, the other three have red. \n\r\n4.) When you hold the album cover to a mirror, the word \"Beatles\" is a phone number, which is 2317438. It has been said that if you had called this number back then, a recording came on saying, \"you're getting closer.\" Of course there is no area code etc., so I doubt this one too.\n\r\nThe Songs:\n\r\n1.) I Am The Walrus: At the end of the song, where the spoken words from the play King Lear are placed, you here \"O, untimely death!\" and of course as we know, \"The Walrus Was Paul.\"\n\r\n2.) Strawberry Fields Forever: When John Lennon says in the end of the song the words \"Cranberry Sauce,\" it was long believed to be he saying \"I Buried Paul.\" However, it was electronically manipulated to sound like he was saying \"I Buried Paul\" but he actually isn't. 3.) All You Need Is Love: At the end, Lennon says, \"Yes, he's dead.\"\n\r\nYellow Submarine\n\r\nThe Front and Back Covers\n\r\n1.) Lennon's hand raised over Paul's head, indicating \"death.\"\n\r\nThe Beatles (The White Album)\n\r\n1.) Glass Onion: The term used for a coffin with a glass top.\n\r\n2.) 'Don't Pass Me By: \"You were in a car crash....\"\n\r\n3.) Revolution 9: The words, \"Number nine, number nine,\" repeated many times are supposed to say when played backwards, \"dead man, turn me on dead man.\" The reference to the number 9 is supposed to be that of McCartney having nine letters.\n\r\nAbbey Road\n\r\nThe Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) The common meaning of the Beatles' dress - Lennon in white for a priest, Ringo as the undertaker, George as the grave digger, and of course Paul, in his bare feet, holding a cigarette in his right hand (being lefty) all means death.\n\r\n2,) The police vehicle parked to the right in the photograph is a morgue wagon. \n\r\n3.) The Volkswagen parked on the left side of the street has a tag that reads, \"LMW 28IF. This has been construed to mean \"LMW - Linda McCartney Weeps\" and the \"28IF\" means that Paul would have been 28 years old IF he had lived\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_223": "\nOk.

(the letter was sold online...big bucks) as for the term \"egg man\", John Lennon loved to go to orgies, and at one of them when a man finished up this guy cracked raw eggs on the girls faces. so John Lennon called him the \"eggman\" .\n\r\n               The end\r\n                hope this helps\r\n                   -Daniel\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_229": "\nHardly any of their songs have a distinct meaning, from what I can tell.

Its everthing that was on his mind in 1967 mashed together and mixed with LSD. \n\r\nThe piano intro is taken from the sound of a police siren. John will have been sitting in his garden, perhaps on acid, and he will have heard the police siren. This will have set his sinister train of thought onto notions of authority and societies control over individuals. An aspect of Johns genius was to get influenced by all that was going on around him, and this is shown in the way he reacts to the police siren.\n\r\n\"I am he As you are he As you are me And we are all together.\" This basically means were all the same. Its a gesture of togetherness, a hippie slogan. John was ultimately a believer in the goodness of human kind. This line is a plea for empathy amongst humans.\n\r\n\"See how they run Like pigs from a gun See how they fly.\" Possibly reffering to police again in \"pigs.\" Sinister surreal imagery. Hear Johns politics are more agressive and punk like. This is the counter side to his peacefull humanitarien opening to the songs lyrics. Hear already we see the confusion in Johns mind and the many contradictions in his politics. \n\r\n\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m crying.\" Johns confusion and frustration about society bubbles over. He is crying over what he see's all around him. But no one can see him cry.\n\r\n\"Sitting on a cornflake - waiting for the van to come.\" All though his life John feared he was insane. He was an original, and saw things in a unique way. But he wasnt sure if this made him a genius or insane. Hear he believes himself to be insane.\n\r\n\"Corporation teeshirt\" An image of materialistic society, posibly refering to Beatle merchandice, posibly to some sort of authority figure, ties in again with the police.\n\r\n\"stupid bloody Tuesday\" This is the sort of expression a straight nine to fiver may mutter to himself. Its again Lennon looking at straight society. Similar to \"Good Morning Good Morning\" also written around this period.\n\r\n\"man you been a naughty boy\" possible refers to psychology very popular at the time. At our heart we are all just the children we were before. frightened and scared. This is again John singing about straight society.\n\r\n\"You let your face grow long.\" Society dosnt let us express our true feelings. It is \"naughty\" to express sadness or dissatisfaction with the world. John is very sad and disatisfied in 1967. He is also saying that most \"normal\" people are as well, and it would be better if we were allowed to express it without being deemed insane.\n\r\n\"I am the eggman \" In victorian Britain insane people were made to wear egg caps. In the video to this song John wears one of those caps. Hear John is admitting to the world that he is insane.\n\r\n\"they are the eggman \" In the matter of seconds John has flipped this on its head. He now says that he is not insane just because he see's the world in a different way to everyone else. He says the people who live supressed lives in straight society are really the insane ones.\n\r\n\"Oh I am The Walrus\" John concludes that no one is insane. Instead John is an original and he might be insane, he might be a genius, he dosnt know, and he dosnt care, he is what he is. \n\r\n\"Mr. City policeman sitting pretty little policeman in a row, See how they fly Like Lucy in the sky See how they run. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m crying - I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m crying I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m crying.\" More sinister surreal images of societies authority.\n\r\n\"Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye.\" This suggests tiredness, defeat, resignation. The feelings of John perhaps, or the feelings of everyone in straight society maybe? surreal imagery, he never expressed himself obviously.\n\r\n\"pornographic Priestess\" A dig at religion, another authority in society. John has a dig at religion in a school boy way. He was not an intelectual and distrusted the middle class intelectual way of looking at the world. John was a naughty scouse schoolboy at heart, poking fun at authority.\n\r\n\"boy you been a naughty girl, You let your knickers down.\" This challanges concepts of gender. In the sixties every taboo was being challanged and John was a true rebel who loved the idea of outraging straight normal people.  He was at the fore front of the challanging ideas of the sixties. \n\r\n\"Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun,\" John spemt alot of the mid sixtes sitting in the garden of his English mansion. He would usually be on acid. Whilst sitting he would make up songs, get weird ideas, do weird drawings, read, watch tv. His life was aimless and he was unsatisfied. He was unsatidfied with fame, unsatisfied with his marrige, unsatisfied with LSD and crushed by feelings of rejection from his childhood.\n\r\n\"If the sun don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come, you get a tan from Standing in the English rain.\" This shows how strung out John was. The weather meant nothing to him. He didnt mind just standing in the rain. This also explores similar ideas to \"Rain.\" written a year earlier.  \n\r\n\"Expert texpert \" John expressing his distrust at middle class intellectuals who theorises the sixties youth movement. Again he expresses himself in a school boy like way.\n\r\n\"choking smokers Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think the joker laughs at you?\" John looking at mainstream society again. People working nine to five, on there way to work.\n\r\n\"See how they smile, Like pigs in a sty, See how they snied.\" The smugness and self satisfaction of these people angers John.\n\r\n\"Im Crying\" And his frustration with the world boils over again. The tears flood down his cheeks.\n\r\n\"Semoline pilchards climbing up the Eiffel Tower.\" Something bad is slowly creeping over society, but no one can see it but John. We are heading for disaster.\n\r\n\"Elementary penguin singing Hare Khrishna Man you should have seen them Kicking Edgar Allen Poe.\" A final dig at middle class intelectual hippies jumping on the bandwagon. They claim to be enlightened but dont understand the genuis of Edgar Allen Poe.\n\r\nIf this song is about anything it is frustration at the world expressed through a alienated school boys eyes. It is Lennon looking back to his own childhood in which he was misunderstood and labelled a trouble maker by teachers and other authority figures. In this way it can be seen as an English counter point to JD Sallingers \"Catcher In the Rye\" filtered through copius amounts of acid.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_234": "\nThis song to me is complete nonsense. an thats the beauty of it. this was was created for that exact pupose. at the time john lennon was told that a teacher had assighned a group of students to inturpret a beatles song and relate it to what they thought one of their songs actually meant. at the time lennon was in between creating 3 diffrent songs but decided to put them all together after hearing this. while writting all parts of this song lennon was on lsd and just let the words flow. he included parts such a -Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye. just to confuse others. that part of the song is meaningless to the song. this part of the song was from an old nursery ryhme his friend and him created back when they were kids. another part of this song that makes it so careless is that john actually has made a mistake. the song should actually be called \"i am the carpenter.\" while lennon was writting the song he was reading the book \"The Walrus and The Carpenter.\" before finishing the book he believed that the walrus was the good guy in the story when actually it was the exact opposite. the walrus was actually the bad guy who was trying to steal as much fish as possible from the carpenter. over all this song is just a frivolous play on a beatle song. people everywhere, everyday try so hard to intturpret beatles songs, and the funny thing about this song is you cant really understand it. and if you do, then you have lost the complete meaning of this song. this song i believe was created to actually mock beatle listeners and say,\"hey not everything makes sense\" i personally love this song. this is by far my favorite beatle song. due to the fact that it is so odd and absolutely crazy.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_235": "\nsmitty1312: I really hope you're kidding.\n\r\nLindaRonstadt: You are exactly the reason why they wrote a song like this.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_236": "\nPeople this is the actual meaning!! its important!

In my opinion, anyway you guys interperate this song, if it makes you happy or it depresses you or it just gave you the meaning of life, its all right ... :) \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_349": "\ni know, i am trhe only human being on earth that hates the beatles. but, this is one good song :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_350": "\ni cant believe there are 78 posts here.

I stumbled on the proper context for 'Walrus', and after considerable research, believe that the song is an accurate prophesy of John Lennon's murder, 13 years before it happened. Just a couple of hooks: google Mark David Chapman's images and you will find him wearing the 'corporation t-shirt' (the second verse is all about Chapman immediately after the shooting). 'Mr. city p'liceman, little policemen in a row' refers to the two NYC cops who drove Lennon from the Dakota to the hospital uptown, as Lennon viewed them while dying in the back seat of the squad car. The whole song is an accurate timeline starting with the shooting, including who is telling the story. There are about two dozen verifiable facts including that Lennon would be 40 years old when he died. The entire song contributes. Everything means something. Want to hear more?

The Beatles did this stuff too, so most of their songs (exs. I Am the Walrus, We All Live in a Yellow Submarine, etc.) were probably written while they were high. And if you listen to the end of the song really hard, you can hear in the high voices people saying, \"got one, got one, everybody got one,\" and in the low voices, \"smoke pot, smoke pot, everybody smoke pot.\" \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_359": "\nFirstly it's about drugs.

Did you even bother to look for it? Everyone knows the band were potheads, and yes, sometimes bands DO put hidden messages in music, even backwards ( Some, like the thing at the end of Prince's \"Darling Nikki\" are obviously intentional because they sound like gibberish forward). The Beatles wrote the book on weird stuff like this (The \"Paul is dead\" thing was wonderful!) The ex-singer of Judas Priest even admitted to putting clues that he is gay is their songs.
