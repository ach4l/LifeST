{"comment_0": "\nThis song is about a lost love. He writes of the degree to which he knew this girl. They were so in love and so close, but time faded their love. Eventually time took her away from him. This song has a mellow tone to it, that reminds many listeners of lost love and broken hearts. He is almost mesmerized at the power time had on them. He keeps saying how well he knew her and how tightly he held onto her, but time still managed to rip them apart.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nHe knew her in the way in that his soul recognized her soul. Such a natural comfort together and a knowing, there was sacred purpose, like the way cool mountain waters dance down to the sea, bound by something strong but still so wild and free, that give into the passion of the path it takes, everything that is known in nature, as in the way of life that doesn't have to think about it but just knows, but yet indescribable, like teardrops know the words to amazing grace  so lovely. but yet she or he was not able to be together for underlining circumstance. He knew her that way.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
