{"comment_0": "\nFrom what my mom said to me, this song is supposed to signify the memories he had from his childhood with his family, and what made him who he is today. You learn to love what you have or had until you grow up. Many can have memories with their family, others from high school, or practically anything that comes to mind. And in this case, it is quite clear that Blake had memories with his father, uncle and grandparents. When he says these lyrics \n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTakin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 my mind on a visit/\r\nBack in time \u00e2\u0080\u0098cause I miss it/\r\nYou would\u00e2\u0080\u0099nt learn to love it/ \r\nLike I love it unless you live it/\r\nAnd man, I lived it/\u00e2\u0080\u009c\n\r\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telling you that he can only experienc his childhood via the memories that circulate in his mind, and you would\u00e2\u0080\u0099nt learn to love said memories unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lived it just like he did, which adds to the feeling of this song altogether. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
