The first two verses (\"I want to break free\", \"I've fallen in love\") are very strong, positive and defiant in the desire to get out of whatever it is (a relationship, I think) that's gone wrong.  There's nothing he wants more than to break free (\"I've got to break free\").\n\r\nThe \"It's strange, but it's true\" bit always threw me, but I think it's sung to the person he's fallen in love.  The doubts are setting in now: \"But I have to be sure, when I walk out that door\" - does he really want to break free?  Does he love this person enough to leave whoever he's with at the moment?  Can he break free?\n\r\nBy the last verse, he's done it - he's left her/it/whatever.  And now he's done it, he realises how much he needed her/it - \"I can't get used to living without you/I don't want to live alone\".  The person he's left has such a hold on him that, although he knows he's got to complete the break, he can barely bring himself to do it.  \n\r\nAnd the last line, \"So baby can't you see, I've got break free\", re-enforces that: he hasn't broken free yet, not really.  She's still got that hold on him so that he's truly not free.\n\r\nLike I say, it's a bit more ambiguous than the title might suggest and it's a cracker of a song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nAmazing song from an amazing band.\n\r\nI interpretate it the following way:\n\r\n'I want to break free'. \r\nHe's moaning about the person he's with, and that he wants to break free from the persons  lies. As the song progresses, I interpretate this verse as some kind of excuse for how he truly feels: he says he want to get rid of the person he's with, but secretly he doesn't want that at all. That what a lot of people do: it's called putting up a brave face!\n\r\n'I've fallen in love'.\r\nThis verse shows what his true feelings are. He is in love with someone and he's convinced that it's real. \n\r\n'It's strange but it's true'\r\nHe's kind of doubting wether he wants to break free or not: It's strange but he can't seem to get over the way how this person loves him. But, he continues to give himself power by saying that 'he wants to break free, he wants to break free'. \n\r\n'But life still goes on'\r\nHe has broken up with the person, and as everyone always says: life goes on. But he can't get used to living without this love. Now he wants to break free from the feelings of wanting the person back, but deep down he just wants to be with the person. \n\r\nAt least, that's my interpretation, I tried! ;)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI think this is one of those songs that can be interpreted in lots of different ways. I love songs like this that can identify with so many people that need to identify with a song. For me the way I interpreted \"I want to break free\" is partly explored in the way it is used in the we will rock you musical. Wanting to break free from a a world that is just so false and corrupt and untrustworthy and evil, etc. And also I can identify with I want to break free, in terms of wanting to break free from my life the way and break free and change it and myself. This is one of my favoruite songs, based on the fact that it a brilliantly written song but also because the lyrics are so powerful. Songs like bohemian rhapsody are such amazing songs and so creative and imaginative. But I find that I connect more personally to the lyrics in songs like \"I want to break free\".\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI intepret the meaning of this song as a guy who is utterly in love with this one girl who is constantly leading him on.

However he is scared of this change of not being there for her and does not think he can make it on his own\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI've pondered the meaning of this song for 25 years--it has a deep personal meaning to me, and has always left me perplexed, because a guy that I was dating & deeply in love with dedicated the song to me at a bar one night. Our relationship was young, but we felt the same way about each other--in fact, he had professed deep love for me on our second date, despite being on the heels of a recent break-up.I honestly didn't know what the song meant, or what he meant by dedicating it to me As I think about it all these years later, I can't help but think that the song conveys a man's feelings of wanting to 'break free' from one relationship to pursue a new one; leave a relationship where his feeling have not exactly been returned, yet he was afraid of walking out that door & being alone if things don't work out.. His insecurities have kept him trapped in one relationship, and a bit hesitant to pursue a new one as he says \"you're so self satisfied, I don't need you.\" He seems truly overwhelmed by his new lover, whom he proclaims to be his first true love (as my boyfriend did me), & saying \" I can't get over the way you love me like you do.\" My boyfriend felt this way also--I accepted & loved him unconditionally, not just in spite of his flaws, but because of them--they made him who he was. So I think he was scared by these feelings, that someone could love him wholly & unconditionally. He ultimately does break free, immersed in a new relationship, but seems to express some remorse at the end of the song--perhaps leaving a long-term relationship for someone new, he felt apologetic, explaining why he had to break free & still a tad unsteady without her familiarity by his side. That's the best meaning I've come up with after years of thinking about that night in the bar! I suppose I could have asked him what he meant by playing it for me & never once questioned this!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nThis was one of my first Queen songs.
