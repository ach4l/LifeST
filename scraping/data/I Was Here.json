{"comment_0": "\nI think this song is pretty self-explanitory. Basically she is saying she wants to leave her mark in the work and be remembered. I really like the line: \r\n\"maybe i'll write like twain wrote, \r\nmaybe i'll paint like vangoh\"\r\nAnyways, good song. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI really love those lines, as well! :) Even though I know she's talking about Mark Twain and his writing, whenever I sing this song or listen to it I always think of Shania. I am a huge fan of her, this song relates to me in every. single. way. I want to be a french teacher, I want to leave a mark in this world, I want to make a difference, but actually every single word relates to me! Even the, \"Maybe I'll write like Twain wrote\" line :P \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
