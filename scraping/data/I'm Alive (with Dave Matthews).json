I actually think Kenny's voice better suits this song, nothing against Dave, i like him too, but Kenny's just fits better. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis song is freakin awesome. Great duo. Self Explanatory makes you truly value life and live every moment up. A common theme in a lot of songs by both artists.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\n Kenny said, \"The most personal song (on the 'Greatest Hits II' album) is 'I'm Alive,' just because of where I was in my life when I wrote it ... I wrote 'I'm Alive' after my breakup with Ren\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9e [Zellweger]. I woke up one day and realized, even though I'm going through all this stuff and don't feel good about it, the outer shell of my life is really great. I'm alive; I get to make music; I've got a lot of great friends. That's the message of the song\" - Interview with the boot\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_5": "\nWow...Dave makes kenny look like bad lol. But imagine hearing this song on a house boat in the middle of the lake all by your self on a cool night...amazing\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
