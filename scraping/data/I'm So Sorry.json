{"comment_0": "\nI think this song is mainly about a kid that grew up with divorced parents and it was truly tough for him. He soon finds out he's getting a stepfather and he gets all upset about it so he does everything he can to make the man change his mind but the guy doesn't change his mind so the kid gets uspsetan ales it out on them tepfathr for all of his stupidness. And the stepfather allows it. And when the kid is grown up he reaizes how stupid he was and blames himself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI think the title \"I'm So Sorry\" is kind of a sarcastic name for the song. This song (in my opinion) is about someone who thinks he/she has been pushed around, has gone with the crowd, and never had his/her opinion expressed to someone before. I think the person is acknowledging that now, and trying to change that about him/her. \"So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go, you'll never be loved till you've made it your own\" basically describes the whole song, and what I've explained so far. \nThanks for reading my comment!\nHope you like it!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nyes. That sounds very accurate.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
