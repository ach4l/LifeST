There are moments that really capture the desperation of trying to express your love to someone.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song is hot! It's about a man who'd do anything to please his girl.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nYeah this song rocks.  A lot of Bubbles' stuff I can't listen to cuz its just too old school.  I think he's established his own sound with this album though... and its good.  It sounds a bit like he's auditioning for some girl, still rockin' though.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nOh this song IS hot! It's great!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nGreat song!\r\nMichael sings it so passionatly and yet so sensitively.\r\nI can imagine this song is good as a forplay song, while sipping champagne.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\noh snapppp ! i lovee this song !\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
