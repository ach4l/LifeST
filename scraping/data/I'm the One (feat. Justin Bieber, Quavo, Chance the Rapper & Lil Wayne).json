{"comment_0": "\nSeems to tell a fairly common story / theme amongst many hip hop artists. That they are from the \"hood\" and proud of it. They talk about their life growing up (glamourise some criminal aspects perhaps they shouldn't?) and that because of where they grew up they won't change now that they have money ...\n\r\nBe interesting to know if they still live in the ghetto and when they have children if they want them growing up in a similar environment ...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nIt's good to see a hip hop artist not trivalise women and treat them like objects too\n\nyoutube.com/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song I'm the One by DJ Khaled feat. Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper seems fairly straightforward. It appears to be a music story of a man telling a woman that he is the one for her, yet it seems to be more or less a confirmation of the way he feels about her as from the song's lyrics the romantic attraction seems to be mutual. It is actually a fun summer song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nJust heard this for the first time on the radio it's awful. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
