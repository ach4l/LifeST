{"comment_0": "\nI think his feelings have been said to someone who struggles with hearing them and who is incredibly insecure. The person already knows what he is going to say but is not satisfied unless those things are said out loud, and he refuses. It's a waste of his time if he keeps talking and he's still not heard. Why do you think I come round here wasting all my precious time.... Because I want you. You know me well enough so I'm not going to explain. But that other person is starving to hear his words...like walking in the heat all day without water... Missing that connection... Like watching friends connect and not connecting with yours... Losing an argument because though you're right, you can't get your words in order. That person deep down knows he's there but just can't get themselves in order enough to believe it. He believes his person should know him well enough not to keep having to explain himself. He is there and that should be enough. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nMaybe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telling a story of the day he confessed his feelings.

Maybe the friend is taking him and what he does for granted. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been tip toeing around the subject of love for this friend, but now, the levee has broken and it all comes out. This is a literal translation of the song, I know :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
