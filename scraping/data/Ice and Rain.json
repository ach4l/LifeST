{"comment_0": "\nI think this song is pretty simple to get. It's about a girl from the suburbs who fell for a bad guy the whole good girls like bad guys thing comes into play. Then she starts to realize that he's not the right one for her. She wakes up sad and crying all the time but she's still ignorant enough to think she could save this relationship that has no chance. She see's that her dreams are only sidestepped by his dream of making money and she's not really a priority and her mother won't take her back because she ran out on them so she's basically stuck. In the last verse she finally has the courage to just up and leave him and instead she realizes her man ran into some trouble and owes money. So instead paying them he tells the people he owes to go get his girl instead. (\"We called your man he knew just what it is, we told him no dough then we go and get your bitch\"). Knowing she's going to die she doesn't care anymore cause her man had ruined her so much she feel death is the best way to escape the pain is death.\"He killed me when he made me, tell him I been dead\" It was him that killed her spiritually and that way worse than any physical death she's going to experience by that handgun they got aimed at her.\r\n\"So tell him I been dead he killed me when he made me\" Basically meaning the day she met him was the day the person she used to be died already.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis is one of Wale's quite blunt tracks.
