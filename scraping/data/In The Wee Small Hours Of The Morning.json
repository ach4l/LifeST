{"comment_0": "\nNo other song can describe the feeling of love as perfectly as this one.  It's easy to relate to simply because of the fact that if you've ever been in love, you have certainly lost sleep over the fact on whether or not you should tell her your feelings.  \n\r\nSinatra sings this beautifully.  It's sad, and mourningful, yet hopeful at the same time.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nHe wrote this song after getting a divorce from Ava Gardner.\r\nHow sad.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song makes me so horribly lonely it's a great song if you're alone on a saturday night and it's like 2:00 in the morning.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nMakes me really sad :(\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nMakes me really sad :(\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nIts 3 am where I am.

I cannot believe that Sting even attempted it. It's a gorgeous song about love and missing someone. I had forgotten all about it until seeing a Victoria Secret segment (gag). Man, Sinatra owns this song, though!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
