I think you are all maybe seeking something what does not exist. But It is not a mistake, sometimes I do so, but I think there is'not better explanation to this song that Nick has simply written some very, very specific and wonderful prayer. And he says simply, that we can love each other ( you and your beloved one ) despite being different, having different believs, different colou of skin and whatever. A music video of this song proofs this too. And maybe - another aspect that you've mentioned - the platonic love. I see it there too, because Nick Cave speaks here of love in most divine form, mos saint and ( from my own expriencis ) this kind of love in this highest point, as I can say, cleans out all other \"human\" aspect of love... maybe... but as well as this maybe not... it depends of you, how you will explain it... ;-)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nwow..i think it must just be me but i cant help but think this song is about death. i guess in a way it is a love song.. but to me about a dead person. its almost as if the persona, who had never previously belived in god, is asking him to look after that person who has passed, is pleading to leave that person exactly as they are, and is almost asking that in the chance that the loved one needs to be directed to another place, that it one day be back into the persona's arms. Its interesting that i feel that interpretation from that song, seeing as even though i believe in some kind of higher presence, i wouldnt consider myself religious.

Almost every atheist or disbeliefer finds themselves at a point when they are in love with a girl or boy who believes and then you have to leave the critisism against believing and take it to be a part of your life in a way. Cave has said that love songs are the purest form of making songs - totally honest and beatiful. And i think this si one of them. The speaker isn't sure whether to trust in the existance of somekind of god but it doesn't matter. And so he whisperes to the sky: \" If you are there - don't interrupt. Please. This girl is mine and i wan't to lead her home and protect her from the world.\" And maybe he adds: \" Oh and thanks for creating beer\" :D   .... or something like that.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_31": "\nA beautiful song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_32": "\nFrom what I heard Nick Cave is not an athiest but a christian.

He apparently has a very divine image of this person, which it seems as though he very often does get. He doesn't want that shattered (through seeing her as she could potentially \"really be\"), but he doesn't want her to be nothing more than what he sees either... He doesn't want to believe she's an angel, he wants her to be forever exciting and \"new\". But of course, he wants her to be his, to be able to walk down this exciting path of getting to know each other and themselves better together. And, out of the love he feels, he wants her to be watched over; that this divinity he sees in her has also resulted in her being happy with herself, and seeing his true self. In short, he wants this person to be forever exciting, forever a tangible mystery that he can appreciate, as well as he wants the \"her\" he knows to see his true self, and as a result, love him like he loves her. \n\r\nIn a way, it's a bit of the same as what I think \"black hair\" is about - this angelically perfect image one gets when falling in love, that he in this song wants to develop further, but which he gets trapped in later, in \"black hair\".
