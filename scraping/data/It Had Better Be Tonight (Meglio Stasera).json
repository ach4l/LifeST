Tomorrow, who knows what will be?\n\r\nDon't tell me to wait for tomorrow to come. \r\nThere's a door that you're closing, \r\nbetween you and me. \n\r\nTonight, \r\nif you decide to say 'yes' to me, \r\nI'll devote the tomorrows to come only to you. \n\r\n(Chorus)\n\r\nThe day is born, the day dies, \r\nand the night will bring the uncertainty of tomorrow ... who knows, who knows? \r\nJust a single desire is enough to give you no rest; \r\nand a solitary heartbeat on the sheets, \r\nthat won't make you sleep. \n\r\n(Chorus)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI love Michael Buble! his voice is so sexy in this song! yeah, I know it's totally about \"do me tonight\" ... but it's a great song\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nalso in the last verse it's \"But I warn you sweet paesana\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nangiaz, thanks so much for the italian version!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
