This can be an emotional song, as it surely was for Dan Reynolds.  So stop reading if you want it to be special for you.\n\nI'll just leave it at this for now:  Imagine you're raised Mormon and you believe it deeply, so much that you honorably serve two years as a missionary in Nebraska, you come back to major in music at BYU, and it isn't working out the way you want it to, or the way you think it should.  Your interest in it is waning.  Now you've started a band and you're going to drop out of your church's most renowned school to pursue your career (Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check).  A lot of emotions probably go with that.  And some of those emotions are in this song.  People might even call your decision-making ability into question (I don't ever want to let you down).

I feel like the academy is referring to a place for the person to be applauded for achievements. Honestly, the chorus sounds as if the person is just demonstrating that a person grows into themselves with their initial environments and conditioning. Once they grow in a certain location in their childhood, they will stay as that person. Habits may change, but their personalities do not vary as much as they could in their childhood. The person is getting away from a break up, and in order to get through this break up, they have to leave to figure out who they truly are and to build themselves back up again.
