Elvis certainly did not write it, and most probably had no idea about any of the meaning's.\n\r\nObviously there's the \"Number forty-seven said to number three\" verse, but isn't the title a euphemism for shagging.

The Purple Gang was feared by other gangsters, they were killers; they ran all the alcohol blind pigs & speakeasys, as well as all the prostitution and drugs. \r\nDetroit, being across the river from Canada, was a quick route to bring in illegal alcoholin America by boat. \r\nThe Purple Gang even provided illegal alcohol to Al Capone's gang & other well known gangs. \r\nAlso, the Detroit Jails housed females & males near each other until after Sentencing, then the females & males were sent to separate male/female housing. The song did referred attraction between a male and female, most likely a prostitute. \r\nI'm grew up with all the first hand stories from Grandparents involved in both the legal & illegal parts of Detroit history.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_22": "\nCool song, it is a nice change from his other songs that are always about being in love....it gets a bit boring. \r\nI am off for the day now! :-)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_23": "\nSodomy in jail.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
