{"comment_0": "\nTool - Jambi\n\r\n\"Here from a kings mountain view,\r\nHere from the wild dream come true\"\n\r\nHe is introducing the song by speaking from the perspective of someone who \"has it all\" in a material sense.\n\r\n\"Feast like a sultan, I do\r\nOn treasures and flesh never few\"\n\r\nThis person is only concerned about piling up materialistic idols and putting themselves over others. \n\r\n\"But I would wish it all, away\r\nIf I thought I'd lose you just one day\"\n\r\nAlthough he has everything worldly, he would throw it all away if it meant getting rid of \"you.\" (He is about to define \"you\") \n\r\n\"The devil and his had me down\r\nIn love with the dark side I'd found\"\n\r\nHe is relating this materialistic mentality of the world to the \"dark side\" or work of the devil. \n\r\n\"Dabblin' all the way down\r\nUp to my neck, soon to drown.\"\n\r\nHe uses the word Dabblin' to describe someone that is digging into this materialistic lifestyle almost as if he is searching for something but the lifestyle is taking over him too much and he is about to 'drown'.\n\r\n\"But you changed that all for me\r\nLifted me up, turned me round\r\nSo I, I would wish this all away\"\n\r\nBut \"you\" changed that all for me. Here is that reference to \"you\" again and it is positive. It is the reason he would wish away the fleshy outlook of the world. \n\n\r\n\"Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn\r\nBegged like a hooker all night long\"\n\r\nHalf of the time this person acts very christ-like or pious but the other half of the time this person begs for this \"dark side\".\n\r\n\"Tempted the devil with my song\r\nAnd got what I wanted all along\"\n\r\nAlthough this person acts as if they are a noble and good person he is actually getting all of the materialistic and evil lifestyle he craved.\n\r\n\"But I\r\nI would\r\nIf I could\r\nI would\r\nWish it away\r\nWish it away\r\nWish it all away\r\nWanna wish it all away\n\r\nNo prize that could hold sway\r\nOr justify my giving away my center\" \n\r\nThis is a key lyric of the song, Maynard defines the \"you\" that \"lifted me up, turned me round.\" It is his center. Tool is a very spiritual band and I can assure that the center referred to here is not a God, it is the center of himself. It his balance within Nature and this experience, his connection to \"oneness\" or the divine. \n\r\n\"So if I could I'd wish it all away\r\nIf I thought tomorrow would take you away.\"\n\r\nHe would wish anything away that swayed him away from his center. He holds his center to a higher respect than his entire external experience. \n\r\n\"You, my piece of mind, my all, my center,\r\njust trying to hold on one more day.\"\n\r\nHere he clearly defines \"you.\" He's trying to hold onto his center and not be caught up in \"treasures and flesh.\"\n\r\n\"Damn my eyes!\r\nDamn my eyes!\r\nIf they should compromise the fulcrum\"\n\r\nIf his eyes should take him away from his fulcrum (a reference to balance), then Damn them. Take away his ability to see in order to restore balance within himself.\n\r\n\"(If) wants and needs divide me\r\nThen I might as well be gone...\"\n\r\nHe defines what could take him off balance and that is his own \"wants and needs.\" If this does take off his balance, he might as well be dead (gone).\n\r\n\"Shine on forever\r\nShine on benevolent sun\"\n\r\nThis reference to \"you\" and \"center\" is related to the sun. Like a sun, shine on forever (beyond space and time). Let balance be larger than your current experience. \n\r\n\"Shine down upon the broken\"\n\r\nSome people have lost their way. In order to fix the broken from their dark side, let their center awaken in them and fix the problem. Remember, the sun is a reference to the center. He's not actually saying let the sun shine light on us and somehow be fixed. The sun is within.\n\r\n\"Shine until the two become one\"\n\r\n\"Two become one\" can mean many things, but the short version is to say that the sunlight is the answer and will fix the broken. \"Two become one\" is also a trinity (father, son, holy spirit). Son (you), holy spirit (the light within), father (god state - oneness). \r\n\"Two become one\" can also be seen as duality and oneness. Everything in this world is either a 1 or a 0 just like in the Matrix movie, it's duality (day-night, up-down, good-bad,) without it we would not have this experience. In the Matrix Neo gives up fighting his enemy and instead, lets his body merge with his enemy's. He gives up trying to make duality fight its other part, and instead lets the \"two become one.\" \n\r\n\"Shine on forever\r\nShine on benevolent sun\"\n\r\nIronic that Maynard references your balance to the sun again because right after the scene I just described in the Matrix where Neo becomes his enemy, Neo appears as a sun in the final scene. \n\r\n\"Shine down upon the severed\r\nShine until the two become one\r\nDivided, I'll wither away\r\nShine down upon the many.\r\nLight our way, benevolent sun.\n\r\nBreathe in union\r\nSo, as one, survive\r\nAnother day and season\"\n\r\nBreathe is a key word here. Breath is the whole focus of meditation and yoga which are two great techniques to finding your center and balance within duality. If everyone is following their center, we all act as one, and we survive to move forward. \n\r\n\"Silence, legion. Save your poison.\r\nSilence, legion. Stay out of my way.\"\n\r\nLegion is a reference to the group of people still dabbling in the materialistic dark side. The people who seem to be holding onto everything but still can't find what they are looking for. Their poison won't effect the speaker.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nAs far as people stating so adamantly \"THIS IS ABOUT HIS MOTHER\"...ok. So what? It may resonate some feelings about the relationship he has with his mother, but it can also be interpreted individualistically, about the relationship I have with my daughter, for example. I have had moments of despising everything and everyone...but my daughter. And I never will. \n\r\nI don't really want to buy into the arguments, and I won't be arguing at all. \n\r\nHowever, it is very...ironic?...that so many \"Hardcore TOOL fans,\" insist that practically *every* song TOOL releases is about Maynard's mother. Interpreting the music that way, is not the real crime committed in and of itself...it's the added line people choose to give again and again, which is, \"A real TOOL fan would know that.\" Which is ridiculous. \n\r\nA real fan of TOOL would recognize that the band members are individual people, complex in every way as you and I (perhaps more the former than the latter), and the death of his mother is not the only thing that has ever happened in his life. TOOL should be, in my opinion, afforded more respect for their artistic abilities than this sort of pigeon-hole, so many creepy \"fans\" want to place them in.\n\r\nThe name of the band is TOOL. They are a TOOL. Sometimes for aggression. Sometimes for reflection. Sometimes used for anger. Sometimes for sadness. But, the key message in so many songs, is to evolve. Mainly to evolve past the \"Stinkfist\" manner of living, which society throws on us. And, claiming you are a \"real\" TOOL fan and others are not, because they don't point every single thing, specifically, back to the death of his Mother, is nothing but a \"Stinkfist\", in my opinion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nJambi is the name of the genie on the 80s show Peewee's Playhouse.\n\r\nThat ties in with the whole \"wish\" theme.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nFROM TOOLNAVY.COM\n\r\nI think that this song is about how Maynard was on the brink of a problem with excess and he changed for his son, Beacause his son changed him.\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\nHere from the king's mountain view (I am on top of the world)\r\nHere from the wild dream come true ( Its a dream come true)\r\nFeast like a sultan, I do ( I love the excess)\r\nOn treasures and flesh never few ( money and women especially)\n\n\r\nBut I would wish it all, away\r\nIf I thought I'd lose you just one day (But I love you and would give it up)\n\n\r\nThe devil and his had me down ( I know a dark side of excess)\r\nIn love with the dark side I've found ( and I tended to like it )\r\nDabblin' all the way down ( I tried it all )\r\nUp to my neck soon to drown.

Verse one, he has it all, his dream has come true, he's accomplished his goal musically. He's overcome the \"devil\" inside himself, once in love with his dark side. He's overcome the self destructive devil. \"But you changed that all for me\" I don't believe is a person, not his son or his mother, it's the realization that he is one with the divine the divine is \"you\". He prayed and begged to receive enlightenment or collective consciousness and through his lyrics cursed and shouted at the \"devil\" the dark inside him. And then realizes he \"got what he wanted all along\" it was always there he just had to \"see\" it. \"no price could hold sway or justify my giving away, my center.\" His center is wholeness/oneness with it all, would give away all of his worldly possessions if he thought they would take that away from him. It's his peace of mind, his home, it's everything without it nothing else matters, and trying to hold onto it is the struggle because of what we see and what is all around us it is hard to hold onto that divine consciousness. \"damn my eyes if they should compromise... divide me, then I might as well be gone.\" if he lets what \"seems to be or what he sees\" separate him from what he \"knows\" then it will divide him from the divine and he might as well be gone, for repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability to lift the light of heaven conscious of his fleeting time here. The benevolent son is just metaphor for the divine light shining down upon him, \"shine down upon the severed\" all of us who are separated from each other and therefore separated from our connectedness our divinity. \"Shine on until the two become one\" until we realize that we all are one, the collective consciousness. \"Divide and whither away.\" divided we whither and suffer. \"Shine down upon the many, light our way, Benevolent sun\" show us all the way. \"Breathe in union\" \"So, as one, survive Another day and season\" As long as we are separate alls we can do is survive another day, another year. \"save your poison\" don't project your negativity out onto me save it for yourself. \"stay out of my way\"\n\r\nFor me this cd is so much more right in your face and personal, not as many hidden messages or interpretations.

(kind of ironic, but it's not a perfect world)\n\r\nin the first verse he describes what he's been given in exchange for accepting a demon.\r\nthe lyrics make use of the words \"wild\" and \"feast\" and \"flesh\".  overall, he got what he asked for.\n\r\nthe second set of lyrics describes how he achieved his status, when he tempted the devil.  it's pretty interesting that he has to beg for attention, pulling hard on the line before it snaps in your face... (that's at least how i think of it)... if you think about it, it's probably pretty hard to get the devil's attention in the present time... so many sinners to choose from (if you believe in that sort of thing)\n\r\nwhy would he want to wish this great dream away then?  because he's realized his soul is in jeopardy. his \"center\" is not justifiably given away.  he wishes he could take it away, the decision to use the demon as a way to achieve great riches and pleasures.  however, what's done is done, and there is no turning back for him now.  if he could he would...\n\r\nthe third verse relates to what his life is going through, now that he's accepted his \"prize\".  he can only hold on day-by-day... never in control, trying to balance what he wants (what he's gained) and what he needs (his soul or self, however you may think of it).  he states he might as well be gone, again, another reference to how a possessed person may feel.  separating himself from what he's done may be the death of him, and he's struggling for choices.  \n\r\nthe fourth verse is one that i fully expect debate on, being that i don't agree with what most people think the lyrics are saying.  i believe at this point the demon is in control, or he's accepted and merged with it, mocking god and jesus.  he's calling out for the benevolent son to heal the separation (earth and heaven), the same as when he was mocked on the cross, saying come down from the cross.  he's saying to jesus, \"why don't you come fix this if you can\"... the mocking of jesus is the demon in him, who's changed him. he's gained a demon but lost his soul and has learned to accept that and does it's bidding.  the part of the lyrics i disagree with is when it says \"divided i'll wither away\".  i propose that this is actually saying \"divine head a witherin' away\", mocking god, saying that he's useless.\n\r\nthe fifth verse is in the present, how he speaks to his passenger on a day-to-day basis... \"so as one survive\" it's how he's survived, being one with it... otherwise be torn apart.  he's done what it's asked him to do, cursing god breathing in union, and now he demands it stay out of his way.  \"legion\" is another reference to demon possession. \n\r\nall-in-all, i don't expect many of you to agree with me, given that if i'm right, this may be one of the most intriguing yet evil songs out there.  i also expect some cursing and name-calling.  hey, whatever helps you out.  i love tool, and this is one of my favorite songs regardless of it's true meaning.  the fact that it can be taken multiple ways is another thing that makes it a great song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nFirst off this is my first post and I believe MakeSense has a great interpretation.\n\nMine however differs in one main point, instead of him wishing \"you\" away he is saying he would wish it all away to keep \"you\".

There are people in this world who have \"everything\" they have ever wanted and look back and realize there was somebody that is more important than all of it.  To me this is someone the singer loved and wanted to impress with all of their gains, and found out that who they desired has moved on to a less materialistic yet happier life and the singer realizes it but it almost too late and this is his last plea to win their heart over.\n\nAn amazing song, and I have several more interpretations coming.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nGoing to put in my perspective: he's talking about his career, he got all he wanted; he lives like a king, but it's tainted with flesh, and he's still as powerless as before he was famous.

So yeah, it's that dichotomy which I found really interesting and gave me a slightly different opinion on the meaning of the song.\n\nThe first stanza just describes the royal pleasures of materialism and economic \"success\", quickly followed by how he would \"wish it away\" if he lost the \"you\" he references, which I believe is his understanding of \"oneness\" and awareness, taking him away from a dualistic interpretation of the world and towards a sense of connection. It obviously has nothing to do with an anthropomorphized god because Maynard has made it clear that he feels... Less than fond of the traditional concept of god.\n\nI feel like the next stanza only uses the term \"devil\" as a metaphor for darkness, or loss of direction and purpose. He was a very angry and depressed individual in the beginning of their career, and he describes that stage as \"the dark side\", and it basically consumed him. \n\nEnter his state of enlightenment, where it \"lifted [him] up, turned [him] round\". Yogis, mystics, sages, and other enlightened beings have described the ego as darkness, and isn't a presence, but an absence. It is an absence of light, awareness, and once you've shed some light on the ego, its only option is to slowly disappear.\n\nThe stanza about the martyr, hooker and devil just explains the concept of \"reap what you sew\", he projected his own negativity onto everything, and in turn negativity came back to find him. \n\nThe monism concept starts showing more blatantly by \"giving away my center\", because the concept of \"being in your center\" means to be completely aware, focused, in tune with your \"nothingness (nirvana)\" beyond the ego, which most people caught on to with their mentioning of materialism. One way to keep in your center is to perform mantras, where you repeat a sound/sentence/tone/hum/whatever sick sonic manifestation you can create with your mouth, and go into meditation on that, which Maynard does with the repeating of \"give it away\", the idea of moving beyond the egoic state of mind.\n\nThe following stanza makes sense once you get all that so far, and the lyrics on this site are wrong, he says \"my peace of mind\", not \"piece\", so again the confirmation of nothingness, relaxation, stillness.\n\nAfter that, at \"damn my eyes if they should compromise the/our fulcrum\", that's a blatant comment about non-duality, a \"fulcrum\" is something which basically connects and supports pivots. We are the pivots, the fulcrum is what is beyond that, what connects us (no, obviously not a personified god), which could possibly also be collective consciousness, as well as unconsciousness. Which Maynard most likely believes in, since almost all songs on Aenima had themes of Carl Jung's psychological concepts.\n\nThe next part on this site is kind of wrong again, it's supposed to be \"[if] wants and needs divide me then I might as well be gone\", it's really such a fucking brilliant lyric, the man really is fucking genius. The use of \"divide\" to point to loss of oneness. And then the use of the concepts of \"wants and needs\", which again is mostly created by the ego, which is the catalyst for his division, loss of awareness.\n\nI don't think I even need to explain the next part at all, it's just a ridiculously beautiful visual metaphor for the sun being the light, the light of awareness, consciousness, which can connect us all, as well as the concept of duality.\n\nThe last part, \"breathe in union\", the word \"union\" again solidifies the concept of oneness, and breathing is another focus in meditation and regaining center. Thus, existing harmoniously, we \"survive another day and season\". The very last lines, it isn't \"leech, and\", it's \"legion\", the whole ridiculous system we've created which spreads its poison, all the schizophrenia and insanity of humanity. If society were to be a collective person, that person would be diagnosed as a schizophrenic, megalomaniacal, prone to murder and self-harm, power-hungry, very \"asleep\" individual. \n\nI'm going to shut up now, I talk way too much =/\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_20": "\n[Here from the king's mountain view\nHere from a wild dream come true\nFeast like a sultan I do\nOn treasures and flesh, never few]\n\nIf you've ever been one of those people who seeks status, seeks power over others, seeks attention, seeks to feed your greed and feed off the weak....or if you have been the weak....You know what he means. \n\nIf you're the sultan - the controller of exploiting another human - it is often compared to feasting on souls. Many users of methamphetamines, benzodiazipines, opiates, will often sink so low into their hole, they want to drag others in with them. As thought they are a wolf with a fresh kill, dragging it back to the den to consume all the energy it once stored for itself.\n\nNow, if you look at it from the other side of the spectrum, on the victims side, you may see something a little different. \n\nTo the victim of exploitation, human trafficking, drug use, \"Here from my kings mountain view\" - You have been brought up to his \"kingdom\" something he'd like to share with you, as your flesh is new, and he'd like to take it from you. \"Wild dream come true\" Many women, men, victims of human trafficking and exploitation are roped in by their controller. They are often told that they will make some form of fame and fortune out of their wildest of dreams. Dreams they may not have ever had before the extortion. Many of these trafficking victims are former drug users, relapsing. Their wildest dreams to come true would be to be able to use without spending anything of monetary value. Instead, they trade themself chasing a wild dream, of intoxication, of fame, of love, of appreciation, and of good fortune in life. The truth is, nothing will come of it all, except for the intoxication, and hallucinations, and hurt.\n\nGo back to the manipulators point of view. You'll see a lot of narcissism, such a classic thing in drug users and people who exploit others for things they want. \"Here from my kings mountain view\" - The controller seeks to stay on top of the victim, to drag them into a so called \"kingdom\" to see what they might want to see. \"Wild dream come true\" Many people lost to drug use will do anything they can to get theirs, to get off. A wild dream come true for one of these controllers would be a victim, who walks right into their arms, who doesn't put up much of a fight, so that this controller may \"feast on treasures and flesh never few\", ie: feast upon the soul, health, and happiness of said victim, as well as the drugs and cash that often follow such a lifestyle. \n\n\n[But I, I would wish it all away]\n[If I thought I'd lose you just one day]\n\nLets take this from the victims perspective: The victims of human trafficking, drug abuse, mental illness, often wish that they could go back in time to save everything they have lost when they are on the verge of losing every single thing they have ever had. I was a victim of human trafficking, I can tell you first hand, when I first left that life behind, all I could think was \"I would wish it all away\". Every second of it, every single day I wasted my life away, letting the rest of the world control me. I walked straight into it, and I stayed unwittingly destroying myself, everything, everyone I had in my life. I lost it all. Lost my job of seven years, lost my house, lost my job, lost my pets, lost my health, lost my family, lost my friends. \n\nFrom a controllers perspective: Controllers often realize the error of their ways as soon as they begin losing as well. When they lose their freedom, perhaps then, in hind sight, they would wish all their filthy deeds away.\n\nPeople who sink themselves so low into holes, often would do anything they could to bring back what they once had before they fell into the quick sand.\nIf you thought you'd lose it, you might have never walked into the trap. Sometimes, in your delusions, you never did stop to think of what is on the line. You won't care anymore, you won't think anymore, you're lost.\n\nControllers often do whatever they can to keep those that they prey upon in their control. Should they have made some mistake in their exploitation plans, allowing the controlled to slip away for even a minute, they'll often beg forgiveness, make their victims feel guilty, coerce victims into coming back with the thought that the victim they are controlling has no one else but the controller to really \"care\" about. Said victim usually lost everything by the point the controller slips up a bit, and so, in a way they are both wishing many things away. Feelings of guilt will often spread over both in times of withdrawal, separation, mental and physical pain. Often times the controller has nothing left to their name but the fine art of stealing souls and lives right out from under their victims. When they lose their victim, they often lose their food, their mind, their way of life. They will have nothing, and they usually want nothing more than to wish all the abuse and pain they've caused themselves and others away. Controllers are lost individuals, often individuals who have themselves gone through horrific abuses in life. They want others to feel the devastation they've felt.\n\n[The devil and his had me down\nIn love with the dark side I'd found\nDabble in all the way down\nUp to my neck soon to drown]\n\nSin. Everything that a human being trafficked might feel, is often associated with dark immoral things. Sometimes the victim may become disallusioned, they may wish to dabble further into the depths. Either by sheer deception or sheer insanity and psychosis, they often sink further down into the control of \"the dark side\"\n\nThese people sink so far into this sand pit that they've walked into, that they are up to their neck in problems. They won't survive long. They'll either die of disease, murder, suicide, overdose, or in prison. They really do rarely survive these circumstances long.\n\n\nFrom a controllers perspective; you can very easily see that a controller who is addicted to hard drugs seeks to exploit those around him for his own gains. A controller is in love with the darkside they've found. Controllers are not without their own trauma usually. Somewhere along the way they fell into the \"devils path\", dabbled themselves all the way down, to the point where they drag others into hell with them. Controllers are drowning in their own mental illness, their own sick wants and needs; they seek people out to drown, while they also drown themselves.\n\n\n\n[But you changed that all for me\nLifted me up, turned me round\nSo \nI\nI\nI\nI would\nI would\nI would\nWish this all away]\n\nFrom a victims point of view, often times they lose people they truly care about on their way down the rabbit hole. I personally had family and a boyfriend who ripped me out of the situation I had sunken myself into. If I could've controlled the addict in myself, if I could've stayed faithful to the people who really changed things and lifted me up, then I wouldn't be \"wishing this all away\"\n\n\n[Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn\nBegged like a hooker all night long\nTempted the devil with my song\nAnd got what I wanted all along]\n\nIf you've ever been so lost that you can't tell real from fake any longer, that you have no idea what reality truly is anymore, then you'll know what its like to \"pray like a martyr all night long\" --- You're begging, pleading, hoping for some shred of truth, grace, and hope to grace you. I do not pledge to any certain religion, but in the times that I was truly scared, truly lost, I certainly wished for a god that would hear out my prayers.\n\nNow, begging for a hooker all night long truly hits home. If you've ever been addicted to drugs, especially methamphetamines, you know how this goes. Hookers will stay up 24/7 in drug induced, psychotic states, doing anything they can to make a quick buck or their next hit. They beg, they plead, just as hard as they may have prayed, for something to come along to rescue them from the come down. Trent Reznor refers to it as \"The Downward Spiral\". There is lots of contradictory thoughts and confusion that plagues the trafficked and the abusive. They want further into their situation when they are high, they want out when they are coming down, they want more when they need to blind the pain of the abuse they've dished out to themselves and dished out to them from others.\n\n\"Tempted the devil with my song, and got what I wanted all along\" \nThese people often enter these situations wishing for a high that they'll never be able to truly obtain. They get what they wanted often, through abusing themselves. commiting heinous acts, things they never would have before, in search of the high. Some people would say these people \"Want this\", in many ways they do, but when they find their way out - if they find their way out of the hole - they often realize the error of their ways and where they fell astray.\n\n\n\n[Wish it all away\nWanna wish it all away\nNo prize that could hold sway\nOr justify my giving away\nMy center]\n\nI always said, and many people always say, especially drug users; they start out saying that nothing could cause them to fall into the trap of human trafficking and escorting. They often claim that nothing could sway them into such a lifestyle, however manipulation, drugs, and mental illness are usually enough of a combo for someone to give way to their controllers wishes. The victim is essentially signing their life into their controllers hands, who exploits them for their wishes, their treasures and their need for new flesh. Giving your center away, to me, means giving up your moral values to your addictions and your kryptonites.\n\n\n[So if I could I'd wish it all away\nIf I thought tomorrow would take you away\nYou're my peace of mind, my home, my center\nI'm just trying to hold on\nOne more day]\n\n\nOnce again, in between being so high up and being so low down, these victims will often wish that they could take all of this pain away and go back to being the more stable person they once were. Whether it be going into the past, or finding their next hit they are wishing many, many things would be different. They are confused about the circumstances they've trapped themselves in. Often times drug users have lost heir mental and physical health, they are literally hanging onto life and reality by a very frayed, thin, thread. Thus, they are holding onto life itself, the people they love, and the things they love with a shaky, clammy palmed grip. They know they are losing all of this at a fast rate, and they are just clinging to what they can. Clinging to what sanity they have left.\n\n\n[Dim my eyes\nIf they should compromise\nOur fulcrum\nWants and needs divide me then I might as well be gone]\n\nIf you've read this far into my explantation, I feel this part explains itself well. The escort, victim of trafficking, controlled, eaten, beaten new flesh just wants to close their eyes to it all. \"Dim my eyes\" reminds me of the feeling of nodding off into oblivion on opiates. I didnt want to see the hell I had created with my abuser, in a way, I would've rather been dead than in the state I was. Being lost in this lifestyle, this drug addiction, the abuse, divides a person. It tears the good from them, leaves the bad, thus dividing their life into small pieces, some of which they truly will never get back. The wants and needs they used to have, when they become sober and are out of the manipulative situation, these acts they look back upon...often times they'll wish they were just gone, that they would have died, they rather would have been gone, they feel as though they are nothing. Compromise of the fulcrum, just further proves, they are sinking themselves further and further into the hands of abuse and insanity. Like sitting on a rocking teeter totter, the victim will stand on the edge, waiting for something to tip. Waiting to further spiral down into their hole, watching themselves dig a grave for the person they once were before this began.\n\n\n\n[Shine on forever\nShine on benevolent sun\n\nShine on upon the broken\nShine until the two become one\n\nShine on forever\nShine on benevolent sun\n\nShine on upon the severed\nShine until the two become one]\n\n\nWhen you start to see the error of your ways, how you fell into this trap, and perhaps a glimpse of a way out, it is as though seeing a light of hope. A brief glimpse, you hope for this truth to shine through. For this truth to seek out the part of you that you have now buried underground, that your controller has helped you to stow away. If you've ever thought of an angel ascending into heaven, I think of this as a beam of light descending into the grave, a person who once cared about the victim might be this beam of light and hope. Said savior may still see the good side that the controller has buried of their friend or family member. They may seek to reunite the broken pieces of this loved one they once had, that was lost to drug abuse and sexual exploitation.\n\n\n[Divided I'm withered away]\n\nSimply put, once one side, the addicted side, the exploited side of the victim has overtaken that good side, everything around them truly begins to crumble down upon them. Pieces of their soul, their mental health, their physical being are slowly being stripped as though they're poured hydrochloric acid all over themselves. They are withering, the good in them is slowly becoming annihilated by the callings and wantings of this devil within them. They have realized, once they've lost everything, and catch a few glimpses of the hell they've helped to create, that they are dying slowly. Drug abuse, sexual abuse, exploitation, it's all a form of slow suicide. The you that everyone once knew, has withered away.\n\n[Shine on upon the many, light our way\nBenevolent sun\n\nBreathe in union\nBreathe in union\nBreathe in union\nBreathe in union\nBreathe in union\nSo as one survive\nAnother day and season\n\nSilence, legion, save your poison\nSilence, legion, stay out of my way]\n\n\nMany, many, many people fall victim to human trafficking and drug abuse. It is not as uncommon as the general public wishes it were. This person who has realized the error of their ways, who has been saved by the light and the way of good, wish for no one to ever go through the hell they dragged themselves into. They realize that there is no one who deserves that sort of torture, no one, often times not even the person that abused them.\n\nMany seek recovery, many seek to help others. I can tell you, from the drug addiction and sexual exploitation I have experienced in my young life, I wish that upon no one. I do, however, wish to silence those who do wish for these hells to be brought upon others. My controller was seeking to drag me into his pit, he succeeded, and we dragged others into the pit together. Soon, though, I was ripped out of this by the light, my friends and family who decided to drag what was left of me out of the self-made grave he and I had dug for ourselves and others. I thank them every day for saving me, and I wish nothing more than to stop others from doing what my controller and I did to ourselves.\n\n\nI'm in recovery now, and I can see this song being sung from so many points of view, mostly though from a victim of drug addiction and human trafficking.\n\nJust my .02$\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_21": "\nI love this song...

I thought it was very annoying to see that the lyrics were off THAT much.\n\r\nHere's something else: Maynard James Keenan has written other songs about his mother, Judith Marie Keenan. 27 years ago, she had a stroke and, tragically, was left paralyzed. MJK wrote the Perfect Circle song \"Judith\" about his mother. (Notice its her name) In this song he, much to both my shock and dismay, curses our Lord and blames Him for her tragedy. Here is the song \"Judith\":\n\r\n\"You're such an inspiration for the ways\r\nThat I'll never ever choose to be\r\nOh so many ways for me to show you\r\nHow the savior has abandoned you\r\nF*** your God\r\nYour Lord and your Christ\r\nHe did this\r\nTook all you had and\r\nLeft you this way\r\nStill you pray, you never stray\r\nNever taste of the fruit\r\nYou never thought to question why\n\r\nIt's not like you killed someone\r\nIt's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side\r\nPraise the one who left you\r\nBroken down and paralyzed\r\nHe did it all for you\r\nHe did it all for you\n\r\nOh so many many ways for me to show you\r\nHow your dogma has abandoned you\r\nPray to your Christ, to your God\r\nNever taste of the fruit\r\nNever stray, never break\r\nNever---choke on a lie\r\nEven though he's the one who did this to you\r\nYou never thought to question why\n\r\nNot like you killed someone\r\nIt's Not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side\r\nTalk to Jesus Christ\r\nAs if he knows the reasons why\r\nHe did it all for you\r\nDid it all for you\r\nHe did it all for you\"\n\r\nHe says that she was an \"inspiration for the ways that I will never choose to be\" and that she was\"abandoned\" by the Savior. Maynard had lost his faith when his mother suffered her stroke and she became paralyzed, 27 years ago.\n\r\nThis brings me to my next point, which is like an epiphamy(i think thats spelt right)The latest Tool album, 10,000 Days, shows evidence that MJK has changed his ways(please, just look at the other song lyrics)Jambi, Wings For Marie, and yes, 10,000 Days talk about his mother, and her return to the Savior. He even says in 10,000 Days:\n\r\n\"Fetch me the Spirit, the Son, and the Father\r\nTell them thier pillar of Faith has ascended\"\n\r\nNow, it gets wierd.  Judith Marie, his mother was paralyzed for 27 years... or 10,000 days.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_62": "\nRight on JackRules.\n\r\nI like this song, as with most tool.

Don't speak so loosely. I have noticed several lines in the cd that sound as though they could be referencing religious meanings, but I doubt MJK has \"found Jesus\". \n\r\nIf this song is suppose to be about how MJK believes in this religious garabe now, then ending the song by saying  (Silence leech, and save your poison.\r\nSilence leech, and stay out of my way.) is kind of contradicting what your saying.\n\r\nAlso note in Judith he says (inspiration for the ways that I will never choose to be), note that he says NEVER choose to be. \n\r\n\"Fetch me the Spirit, the Son, and the Father\r\nTell them thier pillar of Faith has ascended\"\n\r\nI personally think that in this line he just means if what is mother believes to be true is true, then she is ascending to heaven.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_64": "\nI got the impression from those lines that he was referencing his mother's beliefs, not his own. Despite what Maynard himself believes, he always respected how his mother held true to her beliefs throughout her entire life. To me, The Pot is about the hypocricy of the other people in his mother's church, who Maynard grew up seeing as entirely fake. He has said that he is not against the beliefs of Christianity or any religion, but he is against the organization and heirarchy of the modern church. So I don't think this cd shows an epiphany in any way.\n\r\nOh, with Jambi, when I listen to this song, I got the impression that the \"Shine on..\" lines were from Maynard's mother herself. She tells him to \"Shine until the two become one.\" I think this is about the same thing as \"Right In Two.\" That Maynard's mother wants him to devote his life towards bettering mankind. \n\r\nI don't know, this album has evoked so much thought from me and seemingly everyone on this site, so to me this is the best album to come out in a long, long time.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_65": "\nHave you ever considered that the references to the leach could be referring to the devil or satan whom he references in the song by name \"Tempted the devil with my song,\" and alludes to elsewhere \"The devil with his had me down) \r\nIn love with the dark side I'd found. \r\nDabble in all the way down \r\nUp to my neck soon to drown.\"\n\r\nI think he is speaking of how the devil drug him into the hole that was atheism and that he fell in love with what he found there for a time. In my opinion the leach that he is referring to is the devil standing in his way or obstructing his path to God. \"Silence leech, and say your poison \r\nSilence leech, and stay out of my way\" In my opinion this is Maynard placing his own wording on the same sentiment Jesus expressed when he said \"Get Thee Behind Me Satan.\" \n\r\nIn my opinion, while Maynard may not be ready to pick up a hymnal and start singing; his once steadfast atheism has at least been shaken. I sight as evidence from 10,000 days \"Set as I am in my ways and arrogance, Burden of proof cast upon non-believers. \"  To me there is no disputing that he is saying here that while he may not be a believer, at the very least the burden of proof is no longer on christians because his mother's experience and ascension was all the proof he needed. Instead from this point forward the non-believers, whom he used to be so quick to side with, now have the burden of proving to him that he should continue in his atheism. \"Never took a life but surely saved him.\" Could be very literal, she saved not his mortal life but perhaps the eternal life of his soul to come after this one. \n\r\nAt the very least I think people have greatly exaggerated Maynard's hatred for God. In reading his lyrics and watching interviews, it has always struck me that his primary objection has been the type of people who follow God rather than the faith itself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_66": "\n^^Maynard's not Trent^^^\n\r\nhe's never been an atheist, or against god, or whatnot... if you listen carefully, in each and every interview where the subject of religion is breached, Maynard's gripe is with the structure of organized religion... the 'middle men'... the people who use faith to control people...\n\r\nhe's always been pretty spititual, agnostic to be sure, but the belief in a higher order of some kind is there...\n\r\nanyway, i really think (even though this isn't really the place for it) lyrics like \n\r\n\"Set as I am in my ways and arrogance, Burden of proof cast upon non-believers. \"\n\r\nis more a reference to the fact that 'true believers' (like his mom was) don't need to prove anything to those who don't subscribe, it's more like their burden to prove otherwise... get it?\n\r\nhe's hasn't become a christian... but you don't need to be to respect and accept someone's faith...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_67": "\nPlease could people remember not to justify their own POVs through Tool songs. It is well established that MJK is and never has been in his adult life a believer of Christ, yet alone a re-born Christian. His opinions from Opiate regarding organised religion have never swayed.\n\r\nHowever, Maynard, like the logical minority in the world, is not simply atheist or dogmatic (which are ostensibly hypocritical in their perspectives...the pot?) but rather an atheist; he is aware that we cannot prove or disprove God or the reliablility of a repeatedly transicribed, and therefore unreliable, text.\n\r\nBut here is my 2cents anyhow, from what I have understood from the past ten years: MJK is outstated in his spirtualism and respect for fellow man and the world, as every right minded citizen should be. This is the essence of most Tool songs, and I believe that in general, one of the gripes that the band has is society's ideal that 'Religion makes good people' and 'infedels are inherently worse people'. \n\r\nSociety affords religion no responsibility for all the harm it does. Similarly, mass society does not see how individuals can be good, moralistic people without following a questionable source material.\n\r\nThe tension in Tool's music is predominantly built on the premise that the world can be a better place if we concentrated our love on that for each other and not on God (if He does exist we are loving him by loving his creations anyway). In my opinion - an opinion fostered in part through some of Tool's music and my own experiences - the majority of organised religion is more selfish than it is holistic in that it joins people together vicariously through some intangible hope instead of actively doing good in the outside world.\r\nI think that MJK's general statement is that by finding our own spirituality within ourselves, we will gain mutual love and respect and only then is the world going to be a better, less hypocritical place.\n\r\nI know this is more of a general analysis, and definately more in relation to 'The Pot' than with 'Jambi', but just thought I had to say that. It makes me pull a funny face when people claim MJK to have found the Saviour Jesus: The saviour he has found is himself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_68": "\n^^^ (golf clap) ^^^ well said...\n\r\nexcept where you said...

I have to say i might not be right, but i could be.\r\nNow, you must admit, even if you dont think that Maynard has changed his ways, he at least questions them now. \n\r\n\"Also note in Judith he says (inspiration for the ways that I will never choose to be), note that he says NEVER choose to be.\"\n\r\nIs it even POSSIBLE that he can change? Its easy to think that he does in fact mean never, but this song was written several years ago, before the death of his mother, and before he had time to think it all out.\n\r\nI am a Christian myself, and the one thing i hate most of all are those pious hypocrites and \"ignorant flippants\" of the church, probably even more than those who arent one. Maynard described it accuretly as the collective Judas, for the ones who betray Christ are the ones who say that the love Him while they dont show love to thier fellow man, they judge while they shouldnt, and who are ever the hypocrite.  Look, Jesus Himself was mostly about how hypocrites like those cause people to turn away from God, so what i think is one of Gods major complaints is how those who claim to be followers of Him neglect His word to the point that they cause others to turn away from God for what has been done unto them.\n\r\n\"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\"\r\nI try to live by that and it reminds me that, sadly, there are people who claim to follow the path of love, compassion, and forgiveness, but are the first to pont the finger, the first to pick up a stone.\r\nMaynard has, and I mean this as the most respectable of complaments, more faith than many believers because of how he preaches the love of one's fellow man, because he underlines basically the teahings of Jesus, that to love your fellow men and serve them is to serve Him. I agree with danger TH14 that you dont have to follow a religion to be a great person and a respectable, decent human being.\"how you treat the least of you is how you serve Me\" Overall, i think that if Maynard isnt a Christian, his messages are.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_71": "\nIMO organized religion is a joke, people should think for themselves and make up their own minds about religion and not have it done for them.

That song is about people who are insane, using the cover of a pulpit to preach thier perverted and dogmatic ways-ways that have nothing to do with a religion but are connected to it because those crazies do so by taking God's name in vain- for personal gain. What comes to mind(and its a little off topic, lol) is that one episode of South Park where Cartmen pretends to be a preacher to get money. And there are plenty of real people out there like that. Come on, who hasnt seen that one \"preacher\" on t.v. with his \"miracle spring water\" that will cure you because \"God told him to sell it to you\" That is horrible, and I am, as well as a majority of Christians, againt fools like that, and its true that it is people like that who cause others to turn away. But please, I ask you, look beyond that, and you will see the Light. Just look at the Middle East right now-people are twisting and perverting a loving and peaceful religion and killing many innocent people in the name of thier beliefs, and even in the name of God. But only a minority of Muslims use a loving religion to kill- my point is, do you honestly believe that this is the will and work of God? NO, it is MAN who does evil, and unfortunatly, some of the most horrific things have been done in the name of religion and in the name of beliefs. But on the other hand, religion has also done some of the greatest things for mankind, so you cant say that religion and beliefs are what is responsible for evil, because the most dangerous belief, the most sinister idea is the lack of one. Ignorance fuels the fire of hate. Hitler, for example, was completly against Christianity, and look what he did. He was brought up to be Christian, but at a young age, something horible happened and he turned against it, he turned to the dark side of himself. Its well known that Hitler, and Stalin too, were both huge narcissists, and even Megolamanics. Hitler saw himself as the father(of germany, and all of mankind, for that matter), he controlled people's minds, and was the closest thing to the devil incarnate-but remember, he shared the idea that beliefs were dangerous. Look, all im trying to say is for you to look past all of the darkness, all of the hypocracy, and all of the other evils, and maybe, just maybe, you will find that all of religion is not bad, that people are still good at heart, and that fullfillment can be found, you just needonly to look up...\r\nWe all have a third eye, and i can say that mine is open, and it was opened by the Light\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_75": "\nThis song and CD is amasing.

I left that Church and, rather than abandon my own faith, i sought a more personal relationship with God, because afterall Christianity was never meant to be a religion, but a relationship with Christ. I TOTALLY agree that a large part of organized religion is, for lack of a better word, flawed. Again, i will use a movie as an example, Stigmata made an excellent point (if you havent seen it, do so) it talks of a gospel that was written by Christ himself (i think that the movie was based at least partially on the gospel of St. Thomas, that isnt in the bible because the catholic church deemed it as \"heresy\" due to its view of the church, or rather, the lack of one) in this gospel, it talks  of how the kingdom of God is inside you, and all around you, and that a church is merely  wood and stone. This basically agrees with what is in the New Testament, but anyway, my point is, you dont need a church to love and serve God, you dont need a man in a collar to tell you that your sins are forgiven, as only God can do that, and you don't need any man to serve as the \"middleman\" between you and God. No one should be forced to believe, and no one should exploit those who do.

He has been speaking about his observations about his mother the whole time, but those lines use the word \"I.\" Implying that now, rather than making observations about the subject of the song, i.e. his mother, the lyricist is looking inward at the impact all of the previous observations have had on him. He even comments that she was HIS evidence. Taken in the context you suggest that line would make absolutely no sense. \n\r\nNo where did I suggest that this means Maynard is now a Christian. I simply think his view of some of those who chose this path has softened considerably.\n\r\nMy mistake for mislabeling him an atheist. \n\r\nAs far as religion being a form of control, I have always found that argument to be fundamentally absurd. Sure ideas are powerful but they are incapable, from a purely physiological and biological persepctive, of controlling a human being or forcing compliance. In the end not even laws or government have proven an effective means of controlling the mind, the body, and human behavior; otherwise, there would be no crime. Fundamentally, it is each individual's decision whether or not to adhere to a particular ideal or faith, and no amount of threatening or coercion can alter the fact that in the end there is still a choice.

The annoucement was an April Fools Joke of course, and he retracted the statement effectivly by saying something to the effect of \"Jesus-that guy's a punk!\" and said the Savior drank up all the wine in his celler, pissed in the bottles, and tried to perform a miracle in his enebriated state.  The original annoucement was so big and scary that mainstream media ate it up.\n\r\nI have a hell of a time believing that \"the dark side\" and \"the devil and his\" refers to the literal Christian devil.  I'm pretty sure this is a referednce to MJK's drug use, and I'd like to think the song Jambi is about his boy, Devo.  Listen to the language MJK uses-to me it definitely sounds like he talking about an irreplaceble relationship.  I'm also perplexed at how anyone could think that the song Wings for Marie demonstrates MJK's repentance.  When I first listened to it I got this image of subject (Judith Marie) marching up to the gates of heaven and demanding her reward for being faithful(GIVE ME MY F***'IN WINGS!)--a rather un-christian image...\n\r\nAs for the song-it's my favorite on the album, and yes this is a great album (but I think first place for me goes to Aenema).

However, I can see how a believer in Christianity can view these SOME  of these lyrics as being pro-Jesus Christ.\n\r\nLike most Tool songs, I see multiple things going on in this song. The beginning of this song is interesting though. Let's use logic to help us. \n\r\n\"So if I could I'd wish it all away \r\nIf I thought tomorrow, They'd take you away\" \n\r\nDespite his use of the word if in this song, I believe his reasoning follows this: If by wishing it all away, the result would be i'd lose you, then I would wish it all away.\n\r\nHe continues to keep solidifying the fact that he would wish it all away, so what does this mean? Well logically what would follow is that the person/thing/organization spoke of in the beginning of this song, Maynard want's it the fuck out. \n\r\nBased on this, It leads me to conclude that this song is anything but religious. The thing he \"wishes away in many past songs, ( schism, the grudge, opiate, ) is organized religion.\n\r\nBut don't get me wrong theres much more to this song. He flips the script all together right here:\n\r\n\"You're my peace of mind, my home \r\nI said I'm just trying to hold on \r\nOne more day\"\n\r\nAlso right where he says this: \r\nBut you changed that all for me \r\nLifted me up, turned me round \n\r\nHe's giving us a hint about where this song is going to end up.\n\r\nHe changes the subject matter to his son, or possibly his mother in these 2 small section, but uses similar language to confuse us all.  Whether it be his mother or son, I believe he's just saying that they are in inspiration to him.\n\r\nNow the ending, the shine on part: You've got to conclude that this part is a message of hope to his son, where he brings in another reoccuring theme in tool's lyrics, the 2 becoming one, the ego, and the self. A lot like some of the lyrics in Right in Two, and Reflection, i believe he is simply saying to his son that he must be the best person he can be, he must strive to exist as one, he must crucify the ego.\n\r\nDivided, he will just fall into the masses and wither away, but as one, you can be a great person and spread the word to others:\n\r\n\"Shine on upon the many, light our way \r\nBenevolent sun\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_101": "\nBlindrider- maybe you should go back and read a little more carefully friend...\n\r\nhe (ruby) didn't state his beliefs... he didn't say 'i don't like this album' he said 'this is a piss poor album'... and he didn't bother backing it up with reasons... i'm as entitled to debunk peoples reasons for not liking it as bs for the same reasons they're not required to like it... like i implied, it's about the least objective thing i've read on these boards...\n\r\ni gave reasons why this album is superior to lateralus...\n\r\nas for religion... plain and simply i enjoy debating religion. along with other things that no one will ever be able to prove or disprove... my beliefs, plain and simply, are that organized religion is a cage... that's it's primitive, and that we as a species can't evolve beyond this point unless we start thinking with our minds instead books written by mad zealots thousands of years ago... books that have little practical application in this modern world. hell, many religious folks don't think we should be exploring mars or beyond because we might find something that would debunk their beliefs... i mean honestly? what the hell is that all about... \n\r\nwe came to a civilized agreement, so i don't even see why you brought it up....\n\r\nbut basically, you call me tunnel visioned? that i can't accept other people's points of view? well, i can't accept ignorance... but I CAN accept other points of view... i respect disgustipated because he's clearly one of the more enlightened less dogmatic among his bretheren... i don't respect ruby cause he/she?'s a little cock who just wanted to flame this thread...\n\r\ni accept that people think differently than me... but that doesn't mean i don't think certain beliefs are highly dangerous and should be snuffed out for the good of everyone... nuf said.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_102": "\n* in case you were wondering, i meant beliefs that would say that taking the life of another human being for any reason is OK... which is digusting and wrong if you ask me... but hey, it's not pc to name certain religions or belief systems which seem to condone these kinds of things... or at least sects of certain religions...\n\r\nif thinking that hypocracy, killing, and mindless trash talking (ruby) is bullshit makes me narrowminded... well than, i guess i am... but isn't that just the pot calling the kettle black...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_103": "\nDamn!!!

MJK has developed his spirituality and recognizes the great benefit he has received in doing so.

I think this is just a singular way for Maynard to express his views on all organized religion, but Christianity in particular is used because it is what Maynard grew up with and it is what is most familiar to him. I think martyr is used in a more classical sense then people strapping bombs to their chest. I see the term being used more in the sense of someone who would defend their beliefs to the death.\n\r\n\"Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn\r\nBeg like a hooker all night long\"\n\r\nThese two lines go hand in hand. A martyr is being likened to a prostitute in that they are wasting their time all night begging to God and getting nowhere.\n\r\nIn general, I think it's safe to say that Maynard tends to write only about things he is personally familiar with. In the case of religion, he will steer towards hypocritical Christians over extremist Muslims.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_128": "\nIf you read \"The Golden Bough\" by Sir James George Frazer, you might understand this song better.

The \"center\" that Maynard refers to could parallel the main geographical part of the sultanate of Jambi.\n\r\nNow I suggest you take a look at Meddlehead40's analysis, and perhaps Blindrider's. I think the fact that you can read \"I would wish it all away/ if I though tomorrow/ They'd take you away\" in two different ways is deliberate. While the sultan's quest to regain the \"center\" of his kingdom feels to him like a quest to regain a part of himself, it also claims his life. Maynard recognizes this by having somewhat contradictory language. I think he might be doing something similar to \"Stinkfist,\" in which he wrote a dialogue between an addicted person and the object of their addiction. In Jambi, I believe he is addressing (you my center) two different things/people, or at least two different aspects of that person. Part of this person acts as his savior, while part of them he's thinking about \"wishing away.\" He's not sure whether his quest to find his center yields wishing this person away or keeping them in his life.\n\r\nHaving two aspects also ties in with the \"two becoming one\" at the end of the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_133": "\nthis song is just awesome, like almost all from 10,000 days.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_134": "\nIsn't jambi the name of the floating fortune teller head off of Peewee's playhouse?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_135": "\nOk, after about a million more listens...

Also ties in with children.  He states the whole \"benevolent son\" bit clearly.  I don't think he's talking Jesus folks, I think he means his own child.  I am pretty sure his anger and \"get out of my way\" stuff at the end are for all the fans that cross the line.  He is just saying he would give up anything, even the amazing life of a musician that is sought after if it interferes too much with his relationship with his son.  Plus, I really think at least one of the parts of the song that everyone writes the lyrics out as \"Dim my eyes, or Damn my eyes\" is really \"Jambi\", just sung with it drawn out a little.  You know, calling for the genie\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 give me my wish.

Take, for example the words \"benevolent son\" (or sun).   Have you all heard of the word polysemy?  It means multiple meanings.  It seems to me that this part of the song has many many meanings, including A) because the song and album definately seem to be about his mother, after her death, Maynard himself (maybe even as a representation of Jesus...he also refers to himself as the chosen one) is the benevolent son who must shine on and bring light to humanity. B) Obviously the SUN shines on to bring life and light to humanity, so maybe in fact he also means the literal sun or just Life-giving light will shine on forever bringing the separated back together (two become one).  C) Son as is not only Maynard's son, but all of the sons of men (sorry ladies, this is not to discount you, I believe that this still also refers to the daughters as well...unfortunately the language we have come to use in talking of spirituality is highly masculine dominated) and the continuing creation of diverse life.  \n\r\nOf course there are many more meanings to not only this line or song but in all of Tool's music. \n\r\nAlso, in analyzing the meaning of many of Tool, many of us tend to get so caught up in the lyrics that we forget the meaning found in the music itself.  The strongest example I can think of comes in the song \"Schism,\" where in the beginning of the song, Maynard calmly states that \"I know the pieces fit.\"  At this point it is as though he is embracing the \"falling away\" of the pieces.  That is, the separation is initially good.  It is amazing that we are able to be individual, unique, and separate from the whole.  After all \"the circling is worth it/finding beauty in the dissonance.\"  Now as we get to the end of the song, after having been taken on a ride through the dissonance and experiencing all that life has to offer, Maynard still \"knows the pieces fit,\" but he is almost no longer calm.  It is as if he is trying to bang the pieces back together - to hammer them back into place.  Tool, Not just Maynard, takes you not only on a spiritual journey through the lyrics, but an emotional journey through the music.  Danny Carey's drums alone have the ability to take you places you may never have understood through the mere words.  I suggest you all try to listen and interpret the songs in there entirety.  It can be a mind-expanding process.  \n\r\nI guess I'm just rambling now, but I am just trying to offer a unique perspective that may allow for an even greater tool experience.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_160": "\ni always thought it was about his son\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_161": "\nJambi was the genie that lived in the TV on PeeWee's Playhouse. \n\r\n\"if i could i'd wish it all away\"\n\r\nKinda funny\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_162": "\nSory i sorta lost track of the convo and im not sure wat the agreed lyrics are at the moment, but ponder this:\r\nSanta is Satan with the letters rearaganged\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_163": "\nalso...A Rear Ganged is rearaganged rearranged!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_164": "\nyea yea, sorry it was getting late by then...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_165": "\nSeen tool live in cardiff, they played this, AMAZING!!! tool were amazing all night, te guitarist out of motorhead came on and played a solo During Schism and in maynards words 'i belive that is what is known as shredding!!' it was the best gig i ever been to, the set was two and a half hours long, and they just kept the crowd going, AMAZING!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_166": "\nI totally agree with Palisade1218.

One of the things I have always admired about Tool is that each album is its own story.  Its own style.  Yes, every Tool song has that distinct Tool sound, but each album feels different.  I have long thought that Lateralus is the most perfect album I have ever heard.  Granted, that is just personal opinion & in no way fact.  It is just an album that seemed complete.  Just one long story & the songs were inseperable from each other.  As with any new album, I am bit reserved.  We hold our favorite bands in high expectation & we often unfairly criticize their artistic vision.  I think this is a great album.  It took a listen or two to fully appreciate it, but for anyone who truly enjoys Tool for more than just being a rock band can't deny that this is a brilliant album & Maynard seems to be baring his soul on this album more than any.  It feels more personal for him & in turn I respect the album even more for it.  Anyway, enough with the rambling.  This is my favorite song on the album.  To me it is a great love song.

Whether this denotes a true belief that Christ has real power or whether it's he's just overcome his disgust of Judeo-Christian metaphor will probably stay as much as mystery as it has with T.S. Eliot.\n\r\nWhat would frame such a huge transition?  Songs like \"The Grudge\" and \"Reflection\" and \"Disposition\" come to mind, where you get a definite sense of transition in Maynard.  In fact, with Reflection he even muses that our sense of self stems from a greater source of being, essentially \"God\", though that's certainly a word stained with centuries of gross graffiti.\n\r\nJambi was an ancient kingdom in Indonesia that stood on a major river and served as the waypoint between warring Buddhist and Islamic nations.  There is even a \"Legend of Jambi\", but I can't find any link to it at the moment.  My guess is that the song references this, since Jambi would be a powerful symbol of division between spiritual beliefs.\n\r\n\"The two become one\" I think means many things on many levels here.  It reminds me of how in the Biblical book of Romans Paul says that we are divided between the law of sin and the law of the I Am.  The two becoming one could be a reference to a resolution of this conflict, so that want and need are no longer in contridiction, but have become a unified desire, as in Taoism.\n\r\nIt may also reference how the \"Benevolent Son\", Christ, was both man and God, the Tao manifested, the two greatest opposites (Spiritual and Physical, Heavenly and Earthly, Death and Life, unified).\n\r\nAnd finally, it may also reference another letter from Paul in which he says this very phrase, that in Christ, \"the two have become one\", which in this context means that Jews and Gentiles are one people in God -- that God's chosen people transcends earthly barriers of race or religion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_187": "\nOh, and I think the last line is\r\nSilence leech and save your poison,\r\nSilence Legion, stay out of my way.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_188": "\nOh, and finally, I just noticed, in relation to the \"two become one\" and allusions to Christ in this song, it's interesting to note that the opening beats (not time sig, which is 9/8 or whatever that craziness is) are 6, then 7, 6, then 7, repeated 40 times.\n\r\nIn Jewish Gematria, these numbers mean\r\n6 = man\r\n7 = God\r\n40 = trial or test\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_189": "\nYou guys are thinking about this way too much.

Tool album, hands down) and I was surprised at how inciteful some of them were. It made me think of the lyrics in a whole new way. But then, I thought I'd read some posts on the 10 000 Days record since I've been listening to alot of it lately... \r\nExpecting to find some equally-as inciteful thoughts on Vicarious as I found on the Lateralus album, I was dissappointed to find that one of the first comments was not an interpretation of the lyrics, but some ass-clown named TREXOR who claims that 10,000 Days is a hoax (this was posted early 2006, before the record's release). Obviously at this time, we all know better. I had heard about these rumours following up to the album's release, but this guy spread it like it was etched in stone! \r\nI skipped through his ignorant rant looking for some thought into the lyrics and all i could find was pages and pages of TREXOR runnin his mouth about how everyones gonna look dumb when the album is revealed as a hoax. I then laughed at him. He must feel stupid now.\r\nI proceed to read text that was posted after the cd was released and naturally, everyone calls him out on his bullshit, and he doesnt even admit he was wrong!! Plus, the guy sounded like an infant throwing out the worst insults I've ever heard.\r\nI was SHOCKED to find that he spread his b.s. throughout most of the posts for this song as well, saying the new record and Jambi sucks, again without explaining his words...\n\r\nWell, I am a believer in free speech, but this little PUNK BITCH NEEDS TO HAVE HIS ASS ROYALLY HANDED TO HIM! WHERE THE FUCK DOES HE GET OFF JOINING A FORUM OF MAINLY TOOL FANS, AND BAD-MOUTHING THEIR WORK? I personnally think 10,000 Days could have been better, but to say it SUCKS??? Even in comparison of their earlier work, this record DOES. NOT. SUCK. Anyone who makes this claim without backing it up with some damn-well thought out reasons is just asking to be called an idiot. I've never seen a person so determined to stick around in a place where everyone hates him so much... i think I speak for everyone when i say FUCK TREXOR! \r\nAnyway, theres my rant, this will be my only post: dedicated to a big FUCK YOU to TREXOR, much like Pixiespider, my inspiration lol \n\r\nBy the way: TOOL is the GREATEST BAND on EARTH! my favourite songs are: H., Aenema, Hooker w/ a Penis, The Patient, and what I consider to be an epic 24-minute long story of [Dispostion, Reflection, Triad]. ---------and Maynard is NOT God, you dumbfounded dipshitz!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_198": "\nTREXOR may had been wrong but they had a right to write what they wrote.

However, this is not highly probable considering that we all kind of know that Maynard isn't a huge fan of Jesus.  Maynard says that he would give up posessions and pleasures just to not lose this person from his life.  It sounds like this relationship that he has fulfills needs he has.  He says \"and got what I wanted all along.  He also refers to them as a Santa, in a manner of speaking.  Does this refer to Maynard feeling like Jesus could be this figure that people abuse thinking that he is someone who grants wishes, or delivers gifts to the prayer?  But I digress.  Whomever Maynard is describing, he seems to suggest that this person is providing him with something and in turn, this person is a part of him and completes him.  However, if this person was ever in danger of leaving, he would gladly give up the things he has been provided.  Maybe this doesn't make sense.

My interpretation is that he is talking about his own son and how he'd give up everything for him.  He sings \"shine on forever, benevolent son, until the two become one.\"  this could refer to the many voices in Maynard's head (which are evident throughout the album in the multiple vocal tracks per song) and how his son will shine on until all are consolidated.  In this way, he transposes Jesus' role as the Son of the Father who shines, thereby uniting all fragments into one Unity.  The song is very simple and a personal statement by each band member;  each instrument holds its own underneath the polyrhythms but they mesh together very well\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's almost like a drum circle.

Just a thought\n\r\n\"The Myth and Legend\n\r\nOral traditions established the roots of Jambi's relationship with Java and the founding of the kingdom and Islam within it. According to the legend, in the fifteenth century a Turkish prince, shipwrecked on the coast, met and married Princess Selaras Pinang Masak, the ruler of the coastal kingdom of Tanjung Jabung, around the lower riches of Batanghari River. The couple had four children, of whom one, Orang Kayo Hitam, became the central hero figure in Jambi Legend.\n\r\nThe Javanese kingdom of Mataram was demand tribute from Tanjung Jabung and when orang kayo hitam was a young man he determined to put a stop to this. He traveled in disguise to the mataram capital, where a master smith was forging a keris with which to kill him. Orang Kayo Hitam killed the smith and seized the 'keris', which he later took back to Jambi. There it becomes known as 'Keris Siginjei', the symbol of royal power in Jambi. The stories goes that the Javanese ruler, fearing the wrath of Orang Kayo Hiram, called for a truce and sealed the agreement by arranging a marriage between his daughter Ratumas Pemalang and Orang Kayo Hitam\r\nAnother legend tells the incorporation of the upriver region into the kingdom and the establishment of the Jambi capital at Tanah Pilih, or chosen land, its present site. Orang Kayo Hitam is said to have journeyed upriver into the interior where he came across a log with a lock of black hair entwined around it, the hair, he thought of a beautiful girl.\n\r\nHe sees off in search for her and eventually came to a village where he found her guardians. As was the norm on occasions when men with magic powers met, he was challenged to single combat. Both he and his adversary leapt, thrust and struck at each other using all the skill of pencak silat, and the fight went on for several days. Eventually, however, orang kayu hitam proved the stronger.\n\r\nAs his prize, he asked the girl's guardian if he could marry her, but they were extremely reluctant for this strange black man to marry Mayang Mangurai, as she was called. They set him a test, traditionally considered to be impossible to fulfill. The test was in four parts. First he must hand over a mortarful of gold, second, the hollow of a blowpipe, third the sleeve of a shit, and fourth, a measure of louse heads. He had a year and a day to perform these tasks. Orang Kayo Hitam set off to Java where he easily obtained the gold. Neither did the other requirements present him with any difficulties.\n\r\nOn his return, the wedding gifts were handed over and the guardians had to concede. After the wedding, the young couple set off down the river in a small covered boat, following a pair of white geese. Mayang Menguarai's father had told them that when the geese left the water and settled on the bank for two days and two nights, there they should build a city. The place was this occurred was then known as Tanah Pilih. When Orang Kayo Hitam struck the ground for the first time with his knife, he hit a gong buried in the earth. When he hit the second time he hit a cannon. Many believed these to be the parents of the girl, transformed in their graves. Others believed that they had fled into the forests rather than embrace Islam. There they became the ancestor of Kubu People (Suku Anak Dalam), the forest dwellers that have retained their animist beliefs and hunter-gatherer existence.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_281": "\nthis song scares my a little, Am I the only one who sees a lot of strong christian influences.

He asks that genie in the bottle (he looks sorta like a worm) to grant him a wish and his jambi says \"There are only a few wishes I can grant but I think I know what you want and I believe it's within my power to grant this one... speak\"  \"I wanna wish it all away\"  \"Granted\".  The rest of the song is merely drunken hallucination.  That was a joke but some of the posts here are far too seriess or even threatening (earlier). \n\r\nDo any of you have experience writing lyrics for a band?  Especially a band that plays in meters of 9/4 (and permutations) -- it's tough.  I'll bet Maynard's life is busy and much of it must filter into his music, intentional or otherwise.  Relationships seem manifest in this song but one can have a relationship with anything - even a bottle of booze.  What I'm saying is that these are confusing lyrics because the song is confusing.  The band often times has grooves laid out and so Maynard picks up a mic and starts to scat and improv.  If it's good he'll write it down.  He'll write down a good lyric wherever he is anyway,  I'm sure he carries around a notepad for it.  Another issue is that the lyrics you write seem alot different when you're in a different mood on a different day and what if the band totally changes the feel?  There's alot that can happen and you guys should know that the song is an entire package and knowing about the life Maynard lives (or speculating) only goes so far with this time of endevour.  The music has to come together to create something as unique as possible while maintaining consistancy - the guys have to like it basically, at least the other guys in the band. \n\r\nThe allusions to religious issues shouldn't be a big deal.  It's everywhere.  Anybody plugged into a society gets a fair dose of it.  It's just a tool anyway if one makes it out to be too big of a force it gains superficial power.  If the Lord has any real power at all he doesn't need to get that inflated by iterations of the same stories.  Jambi as Tool wrote it is their story as a band - one of many.  I gave you my story up above.  I said it was a joke but it wasn't really.  To me the genie that grants wishes could be a bottle a god a hallucinogen or just a dream with power.  That might sound bad but there is alot in this world that I'd just assume wish away if I could so that lyric right there pulls me especially with the style it's deliivered.\n\r\nOne last thing... this is mostly reiteration but why do you guys always have to bring into play Maynard when talking about lyrics?  Not all artists are so egotistical that they obsessively write only about their life and near tangents.  With alot of awereness (and I'm sure Maynard has plenty of that) you find numerous impersonal sources to draw inspiration from.  I prefer to hear people simply talk about what they want the song to mean or what they've decided it means and why... on a personal level for themself because you're all different....

My guess would be that the song is in fact about his relationship to his son, and not wanting his fame or reputation get in the way of being a father. I doubt that the seemingly biblical references in this song are meant to be taken literally. I know maynard is very interested in many new age, metaphysical, psychedelic kinds of things and I do not believe he has now renounced these beliefs and/or practices as being \"the dark side\" he fell in love with. This dark side is probably more along the lines of anything from hard drug abuse, pretentiousness, being cruel or unfair to those he cared about, or anything he felt was a negative consequence of his stardom. And whatever possitive effects have come of it (I know he recognizes there are some) he would give up in an instant if he thought it would somehow harm his son.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_301": "\nby getminesnogets on 12-20-2007 @ 08:42:46 PM\r\nAlso by the way the lyrics are not \"... should compromise the fulcrum\" it is \"... should compromise OR FALL FROM\" thanks \n\r\nTell that to Maynard.

I think its a love song.\r\nThe addiction is the devil's work, which is the first verse, and he finds someone and they become his center, his reason for being. \r\nThen he reflects on the addiction, some nights he prayed for it to be over, and forget it ever happened, some nights he wanted more and more of it, and couldnt get enough.\r\nThen he tries to voice just how much the person means to him, and saying hed wish the addiction away if he might lose whoever it is.\r\nHe then pretends that he is enlightened and no longer needs the addiction, and on the outside it looks like that. however inside he is still divided by his want, the addiction, and his need, the person.

(most likely a person), and wanting them to know that they or it is the reason for living so well, and that everything would be given up for that person place or thing.\n\r\nand as for the title I think it has something to do with the Genie from Peewee, and the phrase that's muttered when summening Jambi. \"Mukala Hi Muka luka hidy ho\" or something along those lines. the guitar riff pattern is pretty similar to the roll of those words. in my opinion probably something that Danny and Adam used to remember the timing and rhythm of the intro to the song. perhaps it just stuck. who knows. only Tool, but will they ever post on here?.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_308": "\nThis song got me sober. I swear. Well, God and myself truly got me sober... but this was the song that was stuck in my head, which inspired the enlightenment which I had some to fully embrace.

So I made that committment (\"...but you changed that all for me, lifted me up turned me 'round...\") and I wished it all away, so as not to lose him just one more day.\n\r\nThank you Maynard!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_309": "\nThe theory of the guitar rift following the phrase from PeeWee's playhouse (to summon Jambi) is pretty interesting.  The syllables and notes sync.  The irony of a song named after a PeeWee character would certainly fit the \"Tool\" sense of humor.\n\r\nLike much of the album, this song could certainly be about Maynard Keenan's mother, directly or as a metaphore.  There are several stages of facing death/grieving.  One stage is \"negotiation\" or \"bargining\" to escape what a person faces.  Maynard here is essentially doing just that-he'd trade everything he has for his mother to live.\n\r\nThe theme of religion runs through the entire album, so religious imagery is consistant with that theme.\n\r\nLegion was the name of a demon in the Bible...could be a reference here (\"Silence, Legion...\")\n\r\nThe entire album is full of reflections on death (of Maynard's mother) and life in general (the song \"Vicarious\" is so forceful because, after seeing his mother die, Maynard is appalled by how some people waste their lives).  Tool's songs are often layered in terms of \"meaning\", but this album is fairly stripped down in that regard, though the songs do leave room for personal interpretation.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_310": "\ni agree completely with the maynard and his son theory\n\r\nas of the whole trexor thing\n\r\nwho honestly cares? like im a die hard tool fan, seen em live 7 times, but they appeal to me, they might not appeal to others, thats ok, thats how life is, everyone has opinions\n\r\nits alright if trexor doesnt like new tool or whatever\n\r\nbut dont u think hed just keep it inside if that was the case? he obviously wants to get a rise out of everyone\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_311": "\namazing song, pretty much everybody here got it right except trexor who clearly has no idea what good music is.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_312": "\nright, this song has lyrics, but let's just phocus on the f*cking instrumental mastery here,,Jones ryff is like some kind of Iraqi 3-17 or something, Dr. Carey's hi-hat work is incredible during the verses, very slick, and then the dope-ass guitar solo part, with the fat drum and bass bottom and Jones guitar part comes out of Satan's hidden basket and leaps into one's head piece.......the grinding and groaning textures of the guitar are a new step up....it's not about 10,000 notes, it is shaping a liquid dragon into sound\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_313": "\nI haven't the slightest of what the meaning of this song is.\n\r\nI love the lyrics\n\r\nBut sadly, this song just isn't very melodic.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_314": "\nThe second track on the Tool album 10,000 Days takes its name from the character Jambi.

It succeeded Palembang to the south, which was a frequent military and economic rival, as the later capital of the ancient kingdom. The move to Jambi was partly induced by the historic 1025 raid by pirates from the Chola region of southern India that destroyed much of Palembang.\n\r\nIn the early decades of the Dutch presence in the region, when the future colonizers were just one of several groups of traders competing with the British, Chinese, Arabs, and Malays, the Jambi sultanate profitably traded pepper with the Dutch. This relationship declined by about 1770, and the sultanate had little contact with the Dutch for about sixty years.\n\r\nIn 1833, minor conflicts with the Dutch, who were well established in Palembang, meant the Dutch increasingly felt the need to control the actions of Jambi. They coerced Sultan Facharudin to agree to greater Dutch presence in the region and control over trade, although the sultanate remained nominally independent. In 1858 the Dutch, apparently concerned over the risk of competition for control from other foreign powers, invaded Jambi with a force from Batavia. They met little resistance, and Sultan Taha fled to the upriver, inland regions of Jambi. The Dutch installed a puppet ruler, Nazarudin, in the lower region, which included the capital city. For the next forty years Taha maintained the upriver kingdom, and slowly reextended his influence over the lower regions through political agreements and marriage connections. In 1904, however, the Dutch were stronger and, as a part of a larger campaign to consolidate control over the entire archipelago, soldiers finally managed to capture and kill Taha, and in 1906, the entire area was brought under direct colonial management.\n\n\n\n", "comment_361": "\nJambi\" is a song by American progressive metal band Tool.

Here is my interpretation:\n\r\nHere from a kings mountain view,\r\nHere from a wild dream come true,\r\nFeast like a sultan, I do, on\r\nTreasures and flesh, never few\n\r\nI think this section is focusing on his life, how great it is.

He loved doing what felt good, not what was right. He dabbled in evil all the way down to his lowest moment in life. If he went another step further he would be past the point of no return from the devil's grasp.\n\r\nBut you changed that all for me.\r\nLifted me up. Turned me round.\n\r\nEither the day his mother passed away led him towards God or she influenced him to become a better person and to lead a life that she saw fit for him.\n\r\nSO I would wish this all away\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd\n\r\nPrayed like a martyr dusk to dawn.\r\nBegged like a hooker all night long.\r\ntempted the devil with my song.\r\nAnd Got what I wanted all along.\n\r\nDuring the time when his mom was diagnosed, he prayed and begged God to help her out, to heal her. But in order for God to help, maynard needed to try and live up to His standards. Maybe he feels responsible for his moms death.\n\r\nBut I would wish it all away\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd\r\nno prize that could hold sway or justify my giving away my center so\r\nIf I could I\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdd wish it all away if I thought tomorrow would take you away.\r\nYou, my piece of mind, my all, my center, just trying to hold on one more day.\n\r\nIf he would have known what would happen in the end, he would have given it all away just to have his mom back.\n\r\nDamn my eyes if they should compromise the fulcrum.\r\n(if) wants and needs divide me then I might as well be gone.\n\r\nHis eyes let him see what he would like to do, things that caused him to be in a mess before. They have compromised his relationship with God and his mom. He needs his mom, but he wants to do these bad things. They are causing him to lead a life that he didnt intend to fulfill so he might as well have never been born if he can never do the right thing.\n\r\nShine on forever. Shine on, benevolent sun.\r\nShine down upon the broken . Shine until the two become one.\r\nShine on forever. Shine on, benevolent sun.\r\nShine down upon the severed .

The song notes how the author experienced life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peak in pleasures, how these same peaks can also bury, and how a new relationship provided the needed capstone (benevolent son being Jesus, also biblically called the \u00e2\u0080\u009clight\u00e2\u0080\u009d) to stabilize his foundation and keep the person together even with the divisive wants and needs we all feel.

However for recovering addicts like Maynard whom was saved by someone close to him, probably given an ultimatum to keep doing dope or lose this person. He wishes he could give it up, but his wants and needs are clouded. He wants to still feel human and care/love, but he needs to get high. Crystal Meth is a life long addiction, don't rock the pipe unless you're ready to either deal with the come downs or lose everything.

My own interpretation of that story is that the title of the track is not related to the lyrics. However, Danny didn't say whether the lyrics were related to the title or whether they were written before or after the title was chosen.

Obviously hes saying he would wish all the fame and money away if he could have 1 more day with her. here from the kings mountain view, wild dream come true but id wish it all away.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_380": "\nThis song shows off how emotion should be projected through a song.

These guys continue to set themselves apart from the pac by not just their raw ability but the lyrics and thought put into them is just...well amazing. I have been music lover for all of my life and a musician for 22 years and these guys are one of a kind and most definitely one of my favorites of all time. This one in particular I can relate to from problems with alcohol (comparing to his addiction to women, I'm guessing)and having a child, not feeling worthy of having such beauty in my life.. \"damn my eyes, if they should compromise our fulcrum. What you need divides me, so I might as well be gone\" hits home. Just like Wings for Marie... my Grandmother was basically a vegetable for many years before passing. His words reach in many ways to many people! Thanks Maynard and band! \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_383": "\nI'd like to say what this song means, but the great part about Tool songs is that they are somewhat user friendly, in that they are very shapeable to what kind of message you hear from them. This is what Jambi means to me.\n\r\nI am 16 years old and live, for some reason, in New York city. It's a shit hole. However, I am also a pantheist, and that means I dont consider myself to be a part of any organized religion. I do, however, feel a primal connection and belonging to nature and the creatues that live nestled in her breast. \r\nOne such animal, is one that also has a bit of belonging to me. I have an Irian Jaya Blue Tongue Skink. I named him Jambi. Not just because it's a nice name for an animal, but there is more behind it. To me, the song Jambi is about a love for something so delicate, so fleeting, and so tantalizingly impermanent, and yet so beautiful like nature. But understood, much like a Lizard. Like my Jambi. People mainly see reptiles as slimy, stupid, heartless, affectionless creatures who lack the ability to love, to think, to feel, to fear. But if everyone looked at nature and her creatures more closely, with a willingness to learn, rather than a desire to conquer, these misconceptions would disappear, when we allow ourselves to observe and live in the world around us with a sense of vulnerability, and as students of our environment, we see that nature... and animals like Jambi... can be intelligent, thoughtful, loving, feeling... all that. He greets me when I come home, sits next to my computer to listen to music, and crawls into my lap when he wants affection. He begs to be petted and he digs through his food for his favorite morsels with the precision of a human mind. He explores his world with a curiosity and inquisitiveness that challenges that of my dog and my cat, be it his tank, my room, the hallway, or the back yard. But yet, as an animal, Jambi is a mortal. And he wont be here forever. Neither will we. \r\nSeek fulfillment any way you can. Through religion? Sure. Through music? Please do. Through nature? I do. Wether or not you believe in an afterlife, there is still the now to take care of. Take care of the now, yourself, your loved ones, and the planet.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_384": "\nThis may have been stated in the last seventeen pages posted to this thread, but since I am new and don't know...how about it means what it means to Maynard and the boys and whatever you take away from the words is what it means to you? Quit speculating about what you think you know about Maynard, his mom, their relationship, his religion, and her disease. Does it make it better for him, her, or you? No. It's life, it's death, and the music helps us all deal with it, make light of it, forget about it, or face it head on.\r\nI love Tool because of what the words mean to me, the instruments, the vocals, the buildups, the crescendos...it's all a part of the experience. I stopped trying to analyze the meaning and associate it with my values a long time ago because it's a very slippery slope to compare your ideals wrenches to wrenches with an artist of Maynard's caliber. Listen to it, love it, don't love it, I don't care, but don't think you know what it means to him and the band...that's for them, not you.

Infact, in almost every way.\n\r\nAll songs, all words, all pieces of art, even just your own reality, are open for interpretation. TOOL would not be a good band, if this wasn't recognized. Further, they wouldn't introduce such mysterious lyrics, if they didn't know that the song can be open for interpretation. \n\r\nMy interpretation:\n\r\nJambi = The thing which you hold so dear, that you cannot even allow your dark side to come anywhere near it. That thing in life, be it a person, pet, idea, place, memory, etc., for which you love so deeply, you would give up anything. \n\r\nFurther, it's that thing, whatever it may be, that may have changed your life. Which, by its nature, because of whatever manner, it allowed you see something beyond the darkness. To see the Sun. \n\r\n\"Shine on forever. Shine on benevolent Sun.\"\n\r\nThe first god humanity knew, was the Sun. When the Sun is risen, we are not in fear in the darkness and everything which lurks there in. \n\r\n\"I'm just trying to hold on one more day.\" - That is all early man did.

And to some extent I believe it is, but as with many TOOL songs I think it's layered.  I've often imagined this song in correlation with nature, the Sun singing a song to the Earth, Moon, and surrounding bodies, life, etc.  A kind of back and forth duet.. for example: \"Up to my neck soon to drown..\" (the Sun setting) \"But you changed that all for me, lifted me up turned me round\" (directed toward the moon).. lol I know it's kind of far out but when you look at the song from this perspective It gives it a new spin!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_388": "\nMJ Keenan for me is a modern day Dante. The lyrics are always multi-faceted and full of allegory. I believe he has stated many times that he is not an artist to do your thinking for you but to help heal himself. If it helps others that's just a bonus. This song for me, is about how the trapping of what is termed \"successful\" in Western culture is based within the materialistic and really the coveting of possessions is actually meaningless. \nA lot of his songs pay tribute to how he was raised and his mother (her religion, and her being disabled), but this hits me to be more about his son. How a relationship such as father and child is so pure without the need to embelish it with material things. Just the gift of time and teaching, and the beauty of a sunrise is enough. At the end I think the lyrics are actually \"Silence, Legion....\" rather than Leech here but it means the same.

He has much wealth from his music, but values the person he is talking about in higher regards. Success with his music drives him from his mother and towards a 'darker' life that the lover girl seduces him with.\n\nThe person supposedly changed him, and drew him away from his mother and her religious lifestyle that she had imposed on MJK. She helped him out of an emotional black hole, and he ended up in a carnal relationship with her. She could potentially be an Indonesian girl from Jambi who had troubles with immigration (\"...they'd take you away...\").\n\nHe also says he is 'divided', in this case between his mother and his lover.\nAt the end, he repeats 'breathe in union', reminiscent of sex; then he decides to choose his mother over the girl who had dragged him away from her.\nHe calls her a poison-spitting leech; a money-burning manipulator, and someone who is in the way of being close to his mother.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_393": "\nI always thought this was like an overdependece on a deity or higher being and a satirical play on it.
