{"comment_0": "\nI think what they are saying here is that this person,author has some issues (everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got their demons\neven wide awake or dreaming) and to protect the other person in the relationship, they decide to ''leave'', break up, let go (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the one who ends up leaving\nmake it okay).\n\n''Every fire I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ignited\nFaded to grey''\nMaybe this means that this person's past relationships didn't go so well and it was their fault.\n\n\nAgain the person saying this probably has problems, issues with themselves and it's beginning to be a problem in the relationship (cause I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a jet black heart\nand there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hurricane underneath it trying to keep us apart I write with a poison pen), but the relationship/love is what keeps them going, fighting through the problems (but these chemicals moving between us are the reason to start again)\n\nThe realtionship is falling appart and the author is trying really hard to fix it (now I'm holding on for dear life), even though they know it's not gonna go back to what it was like in the past (there's no way that we can rewind).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
