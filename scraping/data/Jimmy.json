{"comment_0": "\nFinally, 10 years later, some clarification from the band!\n\r\nIf you listen to A Perfect Circle's \"Judith\" and more importantly, Tool's new \"10,000 days (Wings for Marie Part 2)\", most is explained.\n\r\nHis mothers name was Judith Marie Keenan.\r\nin Judith, Maynard sings 'fuck your god, he's the one that left you broken down and paralyzed'.\r\nIn 10,000 days, he sings '10,000 days in the fire is long enough, you're going home', 'Judith Marie, unconditional one'.\n\r\nJudith Marie suffered for 10,000 days, perhaps from a stroke that left her paralyzed?\r\nShe died on 18 June 2003. Maynard was born on 17 April 1964, so he was 39.2. 10,000 days is 27.4 years.\r\n39.2 - 27.4 = 11.8. He was 11 years old when it happened.\n\r\nLike Jimmy, the track 10,000 days also refers to \"holding the light\" and the light leading you home. In this track, the light is her gift of guidance and faith in him. Home is heaven.\n\r\nTherefore I think Jimmy is about Maynard losing his mother as he knew her. He was young and depended on her. \"The face of your own stability\".  He talks to/of himself (jimmy, eleven) in third person as he is no longer the innocent child he was prior to this event. \r\nHalf way through the song, \"So glad that I have found you\" is Jimmy realising that he himself is lost, not her. The person he knew is still with him in the form of the gift of guidance (the light or \"loaded memory\") she has instilled in him, and he goes on to use it to lead a successful life.\r\n\"I am wide awake and headed home\". There's an ongoing theme in Tool about pain being necessary to advance, and life being that step (best example is Parabol). \"Heading home\" means living his life, moving forward towards the afterlife. \"as soon as pain allows\" means as soon as he has learned the lessons of life.\r\n\"So we can reunite, and both move on together\". Maybe the song is about them reuniting back to the state of happy memories, when they become \"one\" in the afterlife. There's also an ongoing theme of collective consciousness through much of Tools work.\n\r\nAnyway, my main point being that Tool's new work surely confirms \"he\" is mjk and \"she\" is jmk.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nOk, first off I wanna say that I never sign into sites like this.... but just reading all the bullshit on here was just pissing me off. Honestly are you people really that dumb? Obviously 90% of you aren't actual tool fans or maybe bought one CD and consider yourself Maynard experts. Yes Maynard has said that his songs are purposely written in a way that could have several meanings and leaves it open for the listener to interpret it the way they want (that's why he never discusses what his songs are about). But come on...... Sept 11th.....guess he sees into the future, Horoscopes, Numerology, The 11 11 time clock crap, and the list goes on and on. I mean some of you morons are talking about his sister (which P.S. doesn't exist since he's an only child), his mom Peggy, Susie, Kathy. Just stop embarrassing yourselves if you don't know the facts about his family, at least the basics like his moms name. Oh yeah I almost forgot besides getting his moms name wrong lots of you got HIS name wrong. HOW THE HELL COULD YOU BE ON THIS SITE AND NOT AT LEAST KNOW THAT HIS BIRTH NAME WASN'T MAYNARD. The songs name is jimmy.........his name is James......hmmmmmm I wonder who the songs about........maybe his dog. Anyway long story short the song has a pretty simple meaning people......just put the pipe down cause it's not doing all of you any good. It's about him as a boy jimmy......his mom became paralyzed when he was 11...he was sent off to his dads when he was 11..........his whole world changed because of what happened to his mom when he was 11............1+1.......11...the end.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThe song is about spiritual growth, as achieved through overcoming painful events that have been put into Maynard's life path.  \n\r\n\"til one and one are one, eleven..\"  means 1 and 1 together make 11. In numerology and spirituality 11 is a 'master' number.  this means that someone who's life is lead by the number 11 has the opportunity to achieve spiritual mastery and move on from this plane of existence upon death. Maynard is talking about gaining insight into the pain of his past, his childhood. \"glow child glow\" means that his childhood will lead him back home. Home being the place beyond, the great light.\n\r\nIt's also worth knowing that individuals whose lives are governed by 11 are believed to be spiritual 'messengers'.  In many cases they are artists and spiritual leaders.\n\r\nThe general content of the album deals with spiritual growth, for example the song \"third eye\".  Look into what third eye means if you are interested.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\ni'm not bread...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\ncan't put any truth to it specifically but the feeling i get from the lyrics over tools whole discography is a general darkness and anger to begin with in undertow and opiate with a sense of tension between anger and happiness and an overwhelming feeling of being lost while having such strong direction. lateralus has more of a feel of realisation of contradictions, prime example grudge - whoever's right or wrong holding a grudge helps no one... aenima feels like the flushing out of the darkness within. realising lack of self control and desensitising just leads to wanting more(stinkfist) hating the martyr within (eulogy), stepping thru shadows(46 and 2)- this all makes me think of one realising he's missed seeing the world in a way he used to before he started being so hateful and cynical towards the world. so when i here the song to me it's about being in a state of confusion about the misdirection of ones life philosophies and wanting to reconnect with the view held as a child, that part of yourself was always there holding a light that you denied and he's wanting you to return, now i'm heading 'home' to my own self that i've ignored and repressed for so long, reconnecting, one and one is one, eleven... i don't know maynards life story but my interpretation of jimmy agrees with my own so that's what i think of when i listen to it, but i wasn't 11 so i think of 11 being two halves of a whole number, one and one can be one together in eleven...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\ni believe this song is about maynards inner child. His real name is James as we all know and Jimmy is sometimes used as a nickname of sorts for james. Think of it as a name people used to call him when he was a kid. anyway something happened when he was 1, either a family member died or moved away (most likely female), and it tormented him. So in the song he talks about coming home to make peace and free his inner child.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nIt seems that Maynard is referring to his eleven year-old self in this song (calling him simply \"Eleven\").  Something was lost in Maynard when his mother experienced her aneurysm: a part of Maynard stopped growing with him and moving on.  This is evidenced by the lyrics;  \"Eleven is standing still,\"; and, \"Eleven has been and will be waiting.\"  \n\nFor whatever reason, Maynard needed to go home to \"reunite\" with that lost part of him.  Perhaps it is the part of him that looked to his mother as his \"stability\" or just as someone to share mutual care and love for.  Eleven may be the part of him thats capable of loving his mother unconditionally: of idolizing and adoring her the way young children tend to; but that post age eleven, he moved on with the realization of his mother's mortality and may have been angered by it. It does seem that he's grown more compassionate and understanding towards her throughout his songs about her over the years. He might be seeking the balance between loving her as a young child does, but accepting her mortality and that what happened was beyond her control.  Going home seems like a good place to do so if thats where his mother was. \n\nJust a guess though, as I'll never know exactly how he felt towards his mother before, during or after this song (or any of them for that matter).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nEleven is how old he was when something traumatizing happened...he lived the rest of his life reflecting off of this experience \"sleeping, lost, and numb.\" \"Leaving me with the dead and hopeless\" his Mother may have been paralyzed from her stroke at this time, maybe.

This twenty year period (starting on January 11, 1991) will see matter holding more light than it has ever held before. The vibration on this planet has dropped to a very, very low frequency. That is why it is so difficult to remember our origin, remember that we are all connected, remember who we really are. This is often referred to as the Fall.

The narrator (i.e. Keenan), might be describing a painful event at an early age, or we could even go so far as to say that Keenan is lamenting the (for want of better words) 'separation of his spirit', around the age of 11.\n\r\nAs a child, he was a 'perfect spirit' (and please don't mistake me for a crushed-purple-velvet-wearing, palm-reading, chrystal-giggling clairvouyant) as a child, complete; innocent.  His loss was not a literal one, but a spiritual and psychological one.  As he grew/grows into a man, he loses his feminine aspect, or his anima.\n\r\nNo, I didn't misspell aenima, the anima is roughly, in the terms of analytical psychology (founded by Carl Jung and distinct from psychoanalysis, founded by Sigmund Freud, who Jung was mentored by) the female aspect of any male.  i guess it goes along the argument that we are not 100% MALE, but only the majority of our genes/physiology and mental processes are male.  females have a male-aspect, too, and Jung calls this the animus.  Web search these words, there's tonnes of stuff out there.\n\r\nSo our little jimmy is growing into a big James, he's becoming a man, he's losing that unique, androgenous state that we all have as kids (more or less).  The narrator is quite obviously the man that jimmy has become.  He is the lead singer of Tool and he's more than dabbled in the occult, mystical, spiritual etc. endeavours of other people.  He's read a tonne of Jung's work (and stated as much in interviews) and he's aware that Jung talks about the chymical marriage, or reunion.  It follows the lines of the alchemical process (I think), which is the black, white, yellow, red stuff in Lateralus.  The chymical reunion (see the 'Art' card in Aleister Crowley Thoth tarot cards - again, web search it), is the joining of the king and the queen, or rather crudely, Keenan trying to 'reunite' with this anima, to become 'One' again.\n\r\nIt's not an easy process; the negredo, albedo, rubedo parts of alchemy involve a lot of soul-searching, self-exploration and -realisation, and, possibly, copious amounts of hallucinogens and other intoxicants, hence, the 'as soon as pain allows', bizzo.\n\r\nI've dived way deeper into the Jungian interpretation of the song than I intended (but I s'pose it's appropriate, considering the album is choc full of it) and I wanted to also quickly support jimmy11:11's theory on 11:11 and Lightworkers.  The reference stinks of Tool, who take a concept (like Jung's Anima), put their own spin on it (as they rightly should), and then layer it, or relate it to other theories, such as 11:11.  Observe Keenan's battle with his Shadow (another Jung concept) and how Tool combines this with theories on genetic evolution/perfection (46&2 chromosomes, as opposed to the normal 42&2, or whatever it is).  It's the 'wheels within wheels' that Frank Herbert so loves, and which makes Dune (among his other books) such interesting reads, and gets them into the recommended reading list by the band.\n\r\nOnce I send this, i'm going to have another quick look at: greatdreams.com/\u2026, where jimmy11:11's quote came from.

To a numerologist, such as Cheiro, 11 (numerology) would be made use of to derive \"occult symbolism given to what are called the 'double' or 'compound' numbers\"[1]. In this sense, symbolic use of 11 is often not strictly logical. Furthermore, occult use of the 11 as a 'compound', differs greatly from 11 used mathematically as a natural number.\n\r\n11 AS A SUBLIMINAL SYMBOL\n\r\nTo a numerologist, the number 11 can represent the beginning, the architect of the universe, or oneself, and can signify a higher esoteric life purpose. (MC Universe) This number can literally mean a rebirth number \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the number of change, of personal-inward revolution. When considered numerologically, the number 11 can either be thought of in its original form as 11, or 2, i. e. 1 + 1 = 2. In this sense, the number 11 has an unstable nature that switches between itself and its sum of two, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hard number to master, especially for individuals with this life number.\n\r\nTHE LIFE PATH NUMBER OF 11\n\r\nAccording to MC UNIVERSE, 11 represents the illumination, wisdom, channeling into the subconscious level, and unpracticality. Alone, it is capable of a 50/50 chance of using its potential for good, and the other for evil, but that depends wholly on the person. 11 is duality, not singularity, being able to alter the face of the world.

When he says \"I'll move to heal ass soon as pain allows so we can reunite and both move on together\" i think he is talking about himself, reuniting and confronting his memories, accepting them and moving on. Another example \"Under a dead Ohio sky eleven has been and will be waiting defending his light and wondering... where the hell have i been sleeping, lost, and numb so that glad that i have found you i am wide awake and heading home.\" I believe this was a definative moment where he tried to detach his self but a part of him was still there and he was never fully able to accept what happened.

Again to me this song is all about acceptance and understanding, his struggle to accept the things that have happened to him in the past, and reuniting with the memories of his childhood. \r\nHa even though im probably completly off target!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_100": "\nI think that all of you are correct......... those who actually contributed anyway.......\n\r\nCrymie, in my opinion, is coming closest to the heart of it though....\n\r\nThe stroke and the marriage to the evil stepfather do play into all of this, the loss of his anima.  But, there is more to Jung's theory that got left out.\n\r\nFirst is the theory of opposites..... opposition creates energy, this is why in adolecence, boys try as best they can to be manly and girls are as girly as they are ever going to be...... If JMK's stroke did happen when jimmy was 11, post re-marriage... perhaps jimmy felt a need to \"man-up\" to take care of his mother..... causeing him to lose touch with his anima.\n\r\nNext is the Theory of Equivilence.... stating an equal amount of energy is given to either opposing side, if one side is given to much energy, it can cause a complex.\n\r\nFinally the Theory of Entropy, which talks about the tendency of opposites to come together..... when boys and girls grow up, they become more androgenous. This is often a product of Individuation.\n\r\nDuring the process of Individuation (for a man) the anima acts as a guide for the ego to the unconscious.  Leading him to be able to \"step through his shadow\", or in this case deal with the painful memories of his mother's stroke and the effects, and her remarriage and its effects.\n\r\nThis is why in the song she holds a light and leads the way to what Jung called syzygy...... the reunion of the anima and animus. They are often seen in dreams as the king and queen of the enchanted castle. (see Jung's Man and His Symbols) Reuniting the male and female of the inner self, as well as accepting the shadow are of utmost importance in the process of individuation and the discovery of the divine self. All of these theories seem to be a recurring theme in this album.\n\r\nTo protect the autonomy of the song I must say that I based my opinion on the male relating to the anima, as MJK is a man...... but it works both ways..... for women the animus, often comes to us as a wise old man, would lead the way to the \"enchanted castle\".\n\r\n(as a side note, he refers  to her   as \"the face of your (his) own stability\"...... the face of your balance, your anima/animus..... while for men the anima usually takes the form of a maiden, at the age of eleven, generally before boys discover girls, the anima can very well come in the form of his mother.But as an adult,looking back, he sees her as a child; exactly as he left her, at only 11 years old)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_101": "\nYou all are fucking crazy.

Born James Herbert Keenan on April 17, 1964, Maynard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child name was probably Jimmy.\r\nK is the eleventh letter of the alphabet. Ketamine was an inspiration to Maynard, especially on this album. For proof, read the fourth inside page of the liner notes describing (without naming) K as a dissociative anesthetic used for surgery on different species of baboons or monkeys. Anyone who has experienced the \u00e2\u0080\u009cemergent state\u00e2\u0080\u009d of conscious anesthesia on K will draw a distinct psychosomatic connection with the lyrics to the left. K users call the drug state \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeing stuck\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeing in a hole,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because the profound detachment promotes stillness, yet within the sinking depth of the conscious dream state, the mind is wide awake, experiencing a state that is more psychedelic than anesthetic. K is very reflective, often causing the user to put together information about his/her past in a profound way (showing me where it all began). Movements and sounds take on a profound, extended meaning and a sense of ritualism.\r\nIn the reflective state of Ketamine it seems that Maynard recognized an inner calling that has been subconsciously urging him to return to and re-inspect aspects of his difficult childhood. He realized that this voice was a part of himself that he had disconnected from: Jimmy, the eleven year old. Perhaps one reason Maynard rejected his past self was the religious view that eleven-year-old held. Jimmy held a light (a holy view of the world) that is no longer the light that Maynard holds (Maynard killed that light).\r\nThe adult Maynard has a new understanding of the world, a new light to hold. K is especially powerful in that kind of transformation. The experience feels the same each time, yet it is hard to remember it explicitly, once sober. It is like coming home to an elusive but familiar place every time. It is a comfortable, still, quiet place where memories converge and reunite. It feels like you are tapping into a place that has always been there, and that will always be there for you, like home.\r\nEmboldened to confront and accept his childhood, he can heal, reunite with his past, and move on. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJimmy\u00e2\u0080\u009d is probably a song about that, as most carefully analysts have concluded, but they miss the parallel to the drug that caused it to happen. This omission is understandable, because not many people have tried K, and also for that reason many will reject this Ketamine analysis of the song. My answer is this: look at the liner notes, try the drug, and listen to the song again. To not acknowledge K is to not fully understand Tool. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrying open my third eye\u00e2\u0080\u009d also refers to using K or similar drugs to attain a visionary state of projected mind.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_121": "\nI'm pretty sure this song is a reference to the fact that his mother had a stroke that left her paralyzed when he was 11.

I believe that based on the song judith done with a perfect circle...as well as common sense that this had a devestating efect on young jimmy, and he drifted from the love and faith that his mother had. she was very religious and remained so thru it all unto her death. check lyrics on judith...\r\nIt's not like you killed someone \r\nIt's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side \r\nPraise the one who left you \r\nBroken down and paralyzed \r\nHe did it all for you\r\nHe did it all for you\n\r\nhes obviously even after jimmy was written dealing with this faith shaking ordeal. and how his mother never lost faith.\r\nbut i digress... jimmy lost that innocence and faith in god at age 11 and this song is about james' awakening and yearning to return to that innocence. hes asking his 11 year old self to hold the light up to guide him home... if you know or read the lyrics for wings for marie off of 10,000 days the light is faith, the faith that his mother instilled in him and he lost when she had her stroke. \n\r\n This little light of mine, a gift you passed onto me,\r\nI'm gonna let it shine,\r\nto guide you safely on your way \n\r\nYour way home...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_124": "\nI think that 'eleven' refers to the age that Maynard was when his mother married his stepdad and this abuse began.

The verse \"Eleven is standing still,\r\nWaiting for me to free him\r\nBy coming home\" and then later on in the song \"I'll move to heal\r\nAs soon as pain allows so we can\r\nReunite and both move on together\" refers to maybe his stepdad now realizes what he did was wrong and has gotten help professionally and really wants to apologize to Maynard and to tell him that, and he has been \"standing still\" emotionally waiting for the oppurtunity to tell him so that they can both heal and move on. But Maynard has stayed away for so long. Maybe after some type of psychotherapy, where these buried memories were drawn out, he realized that in order to heal, he would have to go home and confront his stepdad.

After that (presently) is Picies which Jesus represents.  2012 will be the BEGINNING of the shift of consciousness into the age of Aquarius (which will be in 2150) when ppl will stop believing in God, start thinking as one.

We need to understand that the human mind is capable of absolutely anything.  Perhaps life on earth is a test... Who knows, nobody does....

Eleven is standing still, waiting for me to free him by coming home.\" - He's clearly stating that he and his mother left each other, in the sense that during the age of eleven, his mother (Judith Marie) had a cerebral aneurysm which ends up causing plenty of dissension between the two, hence the song 10,000 Days (Wings for Marie Pt. 1) and Pt. 2.\n\r\nHe then, two years later moved in with his father after his mother made the suggestion, he considers this the \"best move he ever made.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_151": "\nI just made a account here only to say the following:\n\r\nThe ones that say that one interpretation is better than the other are completely full of shit. The lyrics to any of tool's songs is simply a way of filling out and redefining the full picture of the band.

What matters is your interpretation of the whole picture, the whole song and even the whole album. \n\r\nIt is the sounds that gets you into that emotional state, not the lyrics. Every tool fan should know this, if not.

I'm sure some have mentioned this is influenced by Carl Jung, as was 46&2.  But one thing everyone seems to not understand is eleven.  It's true he is using 11 to signify that something happened to him as a child, but he's not referring to himself as 11.  He's using 11 to signify the the child and the adult connecting again.  \"so 1 and 1 are one, 11.\" Combining the 1 and 1 together, so they can both move on, you get 11.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_153": "\nHas anyone here posted the fact that eleven is three in binary?

SISTERS! Boys and girls and dabblers of all ages!\n\nYou are all right, and yet at the same time you are all wrong my friends.\n\nMaynard's lyrics, much like life itself, carry a duality. \n\nThere's your opinion, and then there's his opinion.\n\nBUT that's not even the end of it. guess what else there is? The connections between those opinions intertwining.  \n\nOver the years, Maynard has expressed coming back to his songs he written all those years ago, and seen them in new light.\n\nThis is due to the reception the external to himself, has given him.\n\nMaynard has a fundamental understanding of the universe itself: EVERYTHING IS PERCEPTION.Everything is ever changing and nothing stays what it is. \n\n\nThis song changes. His view on the song changes. your view on the song changes.\n\nSo IF you want to take anything out of this TOOL you have been given ladies and gentlemen, take this:\nWhatever you perceive from this, at least understand it is whatever you perceive it to be, as long as you are true to your higher self.\n\n..... and i'm not bloody well getting into that on a public forum\n\n.....I will however tell you how Maynard has gotten there to some extent.\n\nWe are dealing with someone who has based his life dealing mainly in one fundamental form of energy for quite some time: Sound.\nIf we are to take the notion of sound from a number of different ideologies tool have incorporated into their music over the years, we come to understand this chap has been focussing on a certain 'branch' of the tree of life, if you will, or to put it in Hindu terms (usually the easiest to digest) the sound chakra, or the 5th chakra:\n\n\"Chakra five (throat chakra) is the doorway to consciousness and the energy center of sound, rhythm, vibration, and communication.  The meaning of its Sanskrit name is \u00e2\u0080\u009cpurification\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \nThis is the chakra that is the energy center that is connected to communication through sound, vibration, creativity, and self expression.  \n\nThe fifth chakra is responsible for the \ntranslation of symbols and other forms into coherent information and it is also our centre of creativity. \"\n\nHis purification was to get the bullshit on pen and paper, yell it out, then be done with it.\n\nIf i had to guess, he's easily past the 6th chakra and is most likely at 7th.\n\nBut once again brothers and sisters, Tis merely a humble souls perception ;)\n\nPeace and blessed be.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_165": "\nmy bro.

I think when you take this along with what others said about the song being about reconnecting with your inner child this song makes more sense. I read through the lyrics with the thought of a therapy session in mind. Maybe he did EMDR therapy or hypnosis idk and discovered something tragic in his past  \"but it took so long to remember just what happened\" prison sex. Then after the discovery began the healing process of rekindling his relationship with his 11 year old self who was \"defending his own light and wondering where the hell have I been?\" Sleeping, lost and numb.

Basically he's singing to the inner 11 year old version of himself. Due to the stroke his mother, Judith, had when he was 11, the impact was so profound that a part of him was left there. \n\nMaynard left to live with his father at that time. Its clear he loved his mother but did not follow the same beliefs in fact a part of himself resented her for her religious believes this is very clear in APC's \"Judith\".\n\n\"Jimmy\" is about him coming to his own resolution and facing what he left behind. \n\nWings For Marie 1 & 2 are his eulogy to his mother and his acceptance.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_168": "\nAlso worth noting Maynard said this song is \"kind of a sequel to Prison Sex\" \n1996-10-21 San Francisco\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_169": "\nThis song is about moving on ... to find the source of the negative patterns we create in our lives that repeat themselves over and over again, which often begin in childhood.

Likewise, Jacques LAcan stablised that the mirrow stage is the moment in which the child recognize itself before the mirror for the very first time: \"What was it like to see/The face of your own stability\".
