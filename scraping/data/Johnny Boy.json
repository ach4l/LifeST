{"comment_0": "\nI think that this song is about a man who's always there to cheer up everyone when they are sad and hides his own misery from them and himself. He lies to himself saying tat everything would be okay. He had to be okay, so he convinces himself of it. Everyone takes him for granted and he is scared to ask for help because they think of him as an infinite person and doesn't want people to get worried. Eventually he gets tired of life and feels that nobody cares and nobody would unless he was gone forever. His reason to live was to help others, but he stops caring one day. So he locks himself to end himself and someone is trying to make him change his mind because they do notice him.\nTo me, this is about making someone feel appreciated and loved because they deserve it the most.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nHe's talking about an important person in his life he looks up to who is giving up, and knows if this person is gone he'll be lost. This person is telling a lie by telling everyone they're fine and nobody should worry. This person never got the recognition they deserve \"the man deserves a medal but he never really one a prize. I think \"he goes to lock the door\" can be taken metaphoricly, he's shutting people out, or literally, closing the door so they can off themself. If you take it the second way it's far more dramatic as it now seems as the person telling the story is actually banging down the door and trying to tell them it's ok and they love them\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song has always painted a picture of a man who's deeply depressed and contemplating suicide. A lot of people think it's something religious and they're probably right but this is how I see it. \n\r\n\"He stays home from work this time\r\nHe never really told his wife\"\n\r\nHe stays home from work and doesn't tell anybody. Strikes me as something somebody who's made up their mind to take their own life would do if they don't want someone to stop them. \n\r\n\"He never really told a lie but this time he decides that it's alright.\r\nIt's alright.\"\n\r\nHe's never really liked before, but he decides to start now by not telling people he's staying home? Again seems like something somebody who plans to end their life would do. He decides alright, perhaps because of the common thought among the depressed that when he's done the deed \"the world will be better off without him?\" He thinks by telling this lie and allowing himself to end his life he's doing his loved ones and himself good thus justifying the lie?\n\r\n\"No one really knows his mind and no one knows behind his eyes.\r\nThe man deserves a medal\r\nBut he's never really won a prize before.\"\n\r\nThe sad truth about many/most depressed people. Others don't understand them, they don't know what happens in their heads. He's done some exceptional things that have gone unrecognized and that's driven him further down this dark path. \n\r\n\"He goes to lock the door.\"\n\r\nThis line gives me chills. He's locking the door and effectively sealing his fate. Nobody can stop him now. \n\r\n\"He is falling\r\nAnd though he knows it's not\r\nThe world looks down and frowns.\"\n\r\nThis part might be a bit of a stretch but he is \"falling\" to the ground after doing it? He knows deep down this is wrong, but depression has taken over his mind and the larger part of him now thinks this is the right decision. Again, he feels he's making the world a better place, but he's actually doing the opposite-\"the world looks down and frowns.\" \n\r\n\"Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy,\r\nGet up cause the world has left you lying on the ground.\"\n\r\nIn the p.o.v. Of one of his loved ones? They want him to recover, to not make this horrible decision to kill himself because the world has him \"lying on the ground.\" They want him to get up because it does get better. \n\r\n\"You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.\r\nGet up Johnny boy because we all need you now.\r\nWe all need you now.\"\n\r\nAgain from one of his loved ones, just continuing to explain that he does have value. Another thought that seems to creep into the mind of many depressed-that they have no worth to others. But the truth is that his family and loved ones really need him, he's just consumed by this horrible disease. \n\r\n\"Someone said where you going\r\nSomeone said to you goodbye\"\n\r\nPeople do care about him. They want to know where he's going and what he's doing. Perhaps this person is saying goodbye fully unaware that this could be the very last goodbye between the two of them. \n\r\n\"They deflect the disrespect when they say that they blame it on the times\r\nThey blame it on the times.\"\n\r\nThey're blaming this depression of his on hard times in the world in general? Kind of telling him to get over it because everyone is a little unhappy? Obviously this is the exact wrong thing to tell somebody who's depressed because it's a totally different kind of sadness, which led him to what happened in verse 1. \n\r\nWe all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife\r\nThey all know you're qualified but they lie when they blame it on the times.\r\nAnd we blame it on the times.\n\r\nHe's a fully functioning human being. He can do things everyone else can do. These people who are blaming it \"on the times\" see that he can still function and assume nothing is really wrong with him. \n\n\r\nSo this is what the song means to me. I'd love for others to add thoughts to this. Easily one of my favorite songs right now. \n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nIn my mind, this song speaks to several undertones of Twenty One Pilot songs if not all. As an avid listener and huge fan of this band, and as biased as it may be, I believe this song is about suicide. The character, referred to as Johnny Boy, has decided to commit suicide. This song is basically a dictation of the moment he is found dead by  people who seem to have cared about him as they say \"you're my pride and joy\" (which is most likely just his wife's words). The world/fate (or some other higher force) could not save him in that moment although their was a general sense that he had determined an end to his life. \"Johnny Boy\" has some sort of \"disrespect\" for himself leading to his suicidal thoughts, but everyone else responding to the situation blames it on circumstances that happened to him.\n       I believe that this song does give the message that he did commit suicide, successfully or not, he was \"lying on the floor.\" The people calling to him give off a distant and fading last call for his life to be saved by letting him know that he is loved, ironically timed as he is no longer mentally present to hear how he is appreciated. Another reference for his lack of appreciation are in the verses \"The man deserves a medal, but he's never really won a prize before.\"\n      The overall message to me is that we should appreciate people while they are with us. We may feel love and compassion for someone, but without telling them directly, there is no way to know for sure that they are aware of it themselves. On the other hand, suicidal thoughts should not be acted on with such haste. Johnny may have killed himself for many reasons but solidified by the lack of respect for himself and the lack of attention from others. If he had approached the people in his life about his feelings or stuck through his life he could have had the chance to live to the day that someone told him he was loved. Unfortunately this wasn't the case, and this song is just a memoir of feeling for a man who may never have known how much he was loved before he ended his life for a lack there of.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\n= Get up, up from your depression up from your sin.\nBecause you still have purpose. =\n\nDon't let the world defeat you.

Johnny was abused by his father and was more of a quiet character. *MAJOR SPOILER IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK*: He was Ponyboy's (the main character) best friend and died after he tried to rescue children from a burning church (I could elaborate more but it's about the song). The point? Johnny died not in vain and was Pony's only friend \"Get up Johnny Boy\", his thoughts that he can't live without him; he was his \"pride and joy\".\nI think the song definitley relates to this. Someone losing a part of them or a physical person and thinking it's the end, but they carry on.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nWhen i hear this song all i think about is johnny boy from the outsiders, like how he never really fit in and he \"never told a lie\" and \"deserves a medal but never won a prize\" idk i could be wrong but all i think of is when jonny boy is saving the kids in the burning house.

No one noticed his depression, or no one cared enough, and left him lying on the ground. The friend is very close to Johnny and calls him his/her pride and joy. Before his depression, Johnny was very caring and helped a lot of people, so his suicide attempt affected a lot of people that needed him.\r\n\"Someone said, \"Where you going?\"- Someone said to you, \"Goodbye.\"-They deflect the disrespect when they say that they blame it on the times.\" Before his suicide attempt, people went about their daily lives, and they didn't really pay attention to what they said. A few people may have said things that impacted Johnny in a bigger and much more negative way than they intended, which lead to his decision to kill himself. After his suicide attempt, many people said that it was because of the world today, instead of looking at themselves and seeing what they had done wrong.\r\n\"We all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife\" Johnny was \"qualified\" to love his wife, which he did, before the marriage failed.

I think this song is about faith and how the world looks down on Christianity. Sometimes revealing your beliefs is considered social suicide. I do think it does have to do with depression, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably depressed because people look down on Christians. He could be thinking of suicide or maybe he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s praying behind closed doors. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m actually very positive that the Chorus is God talking to him. Someone mentioned that they think that the wife is the one that says \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re my pride and joy\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but I have never heard a wife say that to their husband, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what a parents say to their child. I honestly think \u00e2\u0080\u0098Johnny Boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is referring to all Christians. The pre chorus is talking about how he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s found Jesus, and the world looks down on Christianity. The second verse is talking about people blaming people discovering God on the times. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also how some people are confused at how people are so trusting in God. The bridge also sounds like something Jesus would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will carry all your names, I will carry all your shame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nI think this song is based around religion and the Christian faith. this mas \"johnny boy\" is feeling as if he sort of has no purpose and that suicide seems like the best option. however, because of his religion, people frown upon his thoughts and feelings, saying that its just life. That its normally and everyone feels is. the line \"We all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife\" is especially significant to culture. That as a Christian man, you should be able to look and care for your wife, its easy, so why do you need to know or feel anything else. \n\nThe line \"he goes to lock the door\" is significant. we could see this as him hiding the secret of how he is feeling (suicidal). he maybe feels ashamed or embarrassed because his faith doesn't approve of his feelings and emotions. That is why he keeps it a secret from his wife. When it says \"And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame\" its as if the friend or narrator is saying, just be honest and if the world or community we live in doesn't accept it, I will. \n\nthis song is solemnly about someone telling this \"johnny boy\" to get up from this depressive state and to go into the world, to seek an understanding of the world. \" your my pride and joy\" the narrator is saying that this \"johnny boy\" is a good and nice man, he doesn't deserve the hardships put his way. so instead of sulking, he should get up and take on the world.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nI agree with everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideas but I just want to say what I think of what one line might mean.
