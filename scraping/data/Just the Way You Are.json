We have known eachother for three years and she was my first friend when I moved to another state, and we always wanted to be a couple but neither of is knew it/had the guts to ask eachother. I wasn't very social, and all I knew growing up was how to treat a girl and make a girl happy based on The Beatles' songs and what my father (R.I.P.) has taught me. \n\r\nMy girl and I have been much closer lately and all I can really say when I'm with her are compliments, how much I love her, and how she is perfect. I never knew this song existed until just two days ago when we were having a slight argument over texting, she texts me saying that this song reminds her of me.\n\r\n\"Just The Way You Are\" - had me thinking it was a song about being a jerk and I was about ready to get mad at her. Once I listened to it, I fell in love with her. It made me so happy to realize that she actually DOES listen to me when I talk to her about compliment her enough to have a song dedicated to her. The best part is that every lyric in this song, I have said to my girl, before even knowing this song was released. \n\r\nGreat song to dedicate to your girl, especially if you live up to the lyrics; even better if your girl dedicates this song to the way you act.\n\r\nI'm sixteen.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nOne thing I might add to what people have said is that it's apparent that the girl is self conscious about how she looks. The guy is trying to convince her that she is fine the way she is. I know this is the case with a lot of girls out there that I have talked with. Always wondering and thinking that they are too fat, too tall, not pretty enough, hair not done well enough, not enough make-up, etc. Many times us guys try to tell them that they do look pretty they way they are, but the self conscious feeling still yells louder than the guys' words and she ends up not fully believing him. That's one reason why this song is beautiful because its a story of what happens all the time.\n\r\nAdding to everyone else, I absolutely love this song. When I get into a relationship, this song will be my theme song. Its the sweetest romance song that I've heard.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThe meaning behind this song is so obvious..

He said he would send it in a text message, and when I opened it, it said:\r\n\"Your eyes make the stars look like they're not shining. Your hair falls perfectly without you trying. You're so beautiful, I'll tell you every day...I know when I compliment you that you won't believe me. And it's sad you don't see what I see. When I see your face, there's not a think I would change, cause you're amazing just the way you are. Your smile makes the whole world stop and stare for a while. Your lips, I could kiss them all day if you let me. Your laugh is so sexy, even if you hate it. You know I'd never ask you to change, because you're beautiful the way you are.\"\r\nI had never heard this song before he sent me that text, and I listened to it right after. It was so sweet.

The first time I heard it, a guy friend sent me the YouTube link and told me it reminded him of his new girlfriend. It is incredibly sweet. Most of the time, when you really care about someone, provided that they are a good person on the inside, you'll think they are beautiful just the way they are....fat or thin, dressed up or casual, etc. It doesn't matter really because it's the real person that you see....behind all the superficial masks.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_23": "\nThis is truly the sweetest song ever I have heard of. Lyrics are quite simply consisted, which makes this song itself more straightforward, tbh it can be kinda childish sometimes tho. I don't reckon so this time of course.

This song is slightly tacky but good nonetheless. It is very sweet and romantic and something you would serenade a girl with. If a guy rolled up at my front door and sang this with a bunch of roses in his hand (or something like that) I would probably marry him then and there (ok I probably wouldn't but you get the idea.) \r\nSo about the lyrics... \r\nBruno is telling his girl he loves everything about her and she shouldn't change because she's perfect just the way she is. \r\nThis guy is amazing live.

She always thinks that there's something missing, she never felt everything was there perfect for her. Bruno knows how she feels about it, and he is making her realize that external esthetics doesn't matter for those who really feel good for you.
