Kudos RS! Well thought out and you don't miss much. I agree the song is about a high end prostitute. The prostitute is definitely male. People please, when interpreting something try to remember WHEN it was written and performed. This was the 70s. We had to rely on inuendo and be very clandestine, especially as regards what now would be called LGBT subject matter. Often the true meanings were laid between the lines, although I agree with RedShana, Freddie was pretty clear on most of this, for anyone who was tuned in and looking for it. Killer Queen is about a man who is a seemingly delightful very high end prostitute for men. Although I love the idea of the assasin someone had, I know that isn't really what the song is about. Also, someone said something about AIDS, um no! This song was written before AIDS was on anyone's mind. That didn't come until the 80s. Also, \"killer\" was a way of saying something was extremely good/cool, etc. As in, \"did you see the new movie? It's killer, you got to see it.\" So, to sum up, KQ rocks out about a high end male prostitute for gentlemen, who is a real pleasant, playful, charming type to the lucky clients, and therefore, comes highly recommended.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_127": "\nAfter some research based on the time period of the song and historical references in the lyrics I have concluded that this song is about Jacqueline Kennedy Onasis.  \n\r\nThe first verse is key.  The reference and metaphor for her French heritage -  \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe keeps Mo\u00c3\u00abt en Chandon in her pretty cabinet\u00e2\u0080\u009d.   Her pretty cabinet is herself and her fashionable clothing.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet then eat cake just like Marrie Antonette \u00e2\u0080\u009c. Again refers to her French lineage and perhaps the authors perception of her callousness and ignorance at the beginning of her run as First Lady.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA Built -in remedy for Krushev and Kennedy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Jacqueline accompanied the president on a trip to meet Krushev\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Tellingly, Krushev made it a point to shake hands with Jacqueline before the president.  She was built-in referring to she was the First Lady and not external to the situation.\n\r\nAn I\u00e2\u0080\u0099mvitation  Krushev could not decline.  Nor could she decline on the handshake.  She obviously had some impact on the diplomatic resolution.  \n\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCaviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette, extraordinarily nice\u00e2\u0080\u009d. She came from a wealthy family, went to boarding school in France. \n\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Killer Queen, Gunpowder gelatine, dynamite with a laser beam, guaranteed to blow your mind\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Refers to her power, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a queen in her own right as First Lady to JFK.    She is noted as having an erratic personality,  At times paranoid, unstable and other times as confident and effective. \n\r\nThe erratic nature of her personality is also conveyed in the bridge \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrop of a hat ......\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\r\nThe  China reference \u00e2\u0080\u009cmet a man from China went down to Ghiesha Minah:  Jacqueline Kennedy after the assignation hired Chinese born I.M. Pei as architect to design the JFK Memorial Library and Museum.  She ended up on trip with him to China but that was in 1982 years after the song was written.  The went down to Geisha Minah  may be a metaphor for , well you know.\n\r\nI might be totally off base here but it was interesting analyzing these somewhat cryptic lyrics.  Love the song by the way.  \n\n\n", "comment_128": "\nThis I reckon is all about someone he couldn't have. It's nothing to do with prostitutes.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_129": "\n(Warning: Excuse my grammar errors if I have, I\u00c2\u00b4m hispano and have not totally domain English language)\n\nEver I've thought Killer Queen is about a high class woman -just, quoting Freddy here- that degeneres herself into a whore. She started to use drugs. And harder and harder until she turn off into a whore to earn money for drugs.\n\nBeginning with Wine, simple socialization drug:\n\"She keeps her Moet et Chandon\nIn her pretty cabinet\"\n\nThen she starts to be careless with his own alcohol consumption, without limitations. She justifies herself acting like ' it's my life, let me stay, let me consume the sweet-things that I like '. The MA reference, I supose, is an insinuation about high class people that uses his money without care:\n\"'Let them eat cake', she says\nJust like Marie Antoinette\"\n\nI think this part talks about how easier is to make a deal drinking. And yep, it includes more high class people:\n\"A built-in remedy\nFor Kruschev and Kennedy\"\n\nHere her high class life and her consumption starts to oppose:\n\"At anytime an invitation\nYou can't decline\"\n\nNow she is mixing her two styles of life, her caviar (high class) and her cigarettes (consumer life). Acting with etiquette but really she's just drugged, that felling so nice:\n\"Caviar and cigarettes\nWell versed in etiquette\nExtraordinarily nice\"\n\nI see the chorus parts like a hole in the narration, functions like a transition of years or months without importance. In this time she tests stronger things and degeneres herself.\n\nI think 'Killer Queen' not refers at the protagonist. It referes to the drugs, they can kill you, or kill your high class reputation, your queen reputation. Then the lyrics describes the drug-effects she test. Drugs that makes you feel the world like gelatine, drugs that free your mind  and makes feel like gunpowder:\n\"She's a Killer Queen\nGunpowder, gelatine\"\n\nMaybe I'm wrong about this part. In latin america, at the 60's and 70's, 'dynamite' was an euphemism for weed, Idk if that was equals in other countries outside. However, \"dynamite with a laser beam\", I think it means that she use drugs strongers than simple-weed:\n\"Dynamite with a laser beam\nGuaranteed to blow your mind\nAnytime\"\n\nStronger drugs are expensive, and make you addict:\n\"Recommended at the price\nInsatiable an appetite\nWanna try?\"\n\nI have a problem with my interpretation, the next two verses are in past, and I can't explain that.\n\nNow she run away. His high class life over:\n\"To avoid complications\nShe never kept the same address\"\n\nEventualy, she pretends to be high class with a china-guy. Maybe she is steling him, or maybe they are stealing together:\n\"In conversation\nShe spoke just like a baroness\nMet a man from China\"\n\nThis part have many possible interpretation. It's a pun with Asia Minor that include the word Geisha, so, an interpretation is: her modus operandi for steal is be a minor geisha (a whore that acts in reunions); or: she turn off into a geisha (for get money for drugs) in a region of Asia.\n\"Went down to Geisha Minah\"\n\nI think she's stealing with her geisha act 'cause it seems logic, there's not a real evidence in the lyrics. Now she continue her thefts (again, and again), knowing it's bad, but his addiction forces her (incline in that way) to do it:\n\"Then again incidentally\nIf you're that way inclined\"\n\nParis is another reference to high class style of life. Her act is requested on better sites (or more privates). Now she's more expensive and finer (like a perfumed whore) and doesn't care, she just acts for the money:\n\"Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)\nFor cars she couldn't care less\nFastidious and precise\"\n\nAnother chorus part. So, the time pass.\n\nNow her geisha act is over. She's totally a whore, doing the necessary for money:\n\"Drop of a hat she's as willing as\nPlayful as a pussy cat\"\n\nThis part describes her current situation, she have few and little moments un-drugged. (the first line refers she doesn't works drugged):\n\"Then momentarily out of action\nTemporarily out of gas\nTo absolutely drive you wild, wild\"\n\nThe last pre-chorus line isn't about the protagonist, it's about the 'Killer Queen', about the drugs:\n\"She's all out to get you\"\n\nLast time the chorus. The time pass.\n\nLyrics finishes with a simple not-invitacion sentence, Killer Queen story continues, never gonna over:\n\"You wanna try.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_130": "\nI have no clue why, but this song just conquers you. \r\nI love it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_131": "\nAny ideas on what this song is about?
