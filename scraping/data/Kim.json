He doesn't care what people think of his music. He expressed what he felt through this song toward his ex-wife. I know he would never do half of the stuff he said in the song like choke Kim. But don't we all say things we don't mean when we are mad? This song is very intense. It made me want to cry the first time I heard it. \"I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! I SWEAR TO GOD I HATE YOU! OH MY GOSH I LOVE YOU!\" That line I think wraps up the whole song. He thinks he hates her. He is jelous, angry, disappointed. He's so mad, but he still loves her.

I understand that it's not for everyone, but it's fucking Eminem, what do you expect? People who say they hate this song have a right to their opinion, but if you don't like this kind of music, then you should know just from Eminem's reputation that you should not to listen to his music. Anyway, I prefer his darker songs like this one and \"Stan\", which I personally think are probably his two greatest songs, more than his more shallow songs (like \"Ass Like That\" for instance). I like that Eminem is willing to explore the ugly side of relationships and isn't afraid to put real people and sometimes real events and/or fantasties he's had into his songs. There's a real honesty in this song. You can sense that seething repressed anger. I like that raw emotion- you don't see that in a lot of modern music, especially in this genre. And it's so catchy too, despite how raw and open it is. \n\r\nI will say that I'm glad Eminem found an outlet for all his anger, but I don't think he'd be a homicidal maniac like some people seem to think if he hadn't found a way to let out his anger through his music. Or maybe he would. There is a fine like between madness and brillance after all. I think this song is brillant. Both the words and the music. The chorus is really catchy and pretty much explains how he's feeling and what he's thinking. \"Bitch you did me so wrong, but I don't want to go on without you.\" \n\r\n3 hoorays for fucked up dysfuctional relationships!!!\n\n\n\n", "comment_9": "\nSon Of A B*TCH!!!

Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!\" Kim really did fuck him over. She kicked the guy out and let another guy take his place. Have you never felt rejected? Have you never felt replaced? If you have, then you will be able to relate to Marshal very well. And, as the children thing, who the hell cares? Kids see shit that's worse than this on television. Have you watched professional wrestling lately? That is nothing more than softcore porn these days. Sickening, really. Oh, and I suppose you know that Eminem just makes this shit up to sell records, since you monitor his brainwaves and all. I suggest you just shut the fuck up, because you have no clue what you are talking about. \"Marks?\" What a joke. This is a masterpiece, in my opinion. I feel that I would feel just like Marshal does if I was in the same situation.\r\nFrEeThInKeR87, Kim has no right to write a song about Marshal, because he didn't cheat on her slutty ass.

That's a fucked up thought; it's basically saying that Eminem control's what people do, and it's not true.\n\r\nAnybody who commit's an act of violence--whether it's shooting up a school or murdering the wife--was obviously a sick, fucked-up person to begin with, and no music will change that. I listen to Eminem and NWA and various death-metal bands, but I've never killed anybody because of it.\n\r\nIt's just music. Get over yourselves and start putting the blame where it belongs; own up to the responsibility instead of putting on innocent people who are just putting words to a beat. It's not his fault; it's the fault of whoever commit's crimes.\n\r\nAnd Verity--the point of his saying that was not to exonerate himself for his age at the time, but to indicate that it was wrong for Kim to use that as an excuse when it happend OVER HALF A DECADE ago (at the time of the song, well over a decade ago now) and they had both claimed it was over and no longer a concern.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_137": "\nI LOVE this song. i like this song it's really sad and shows how HURT and ANGRY he is inside.

I guess that is what this site is all about, but it would be nice to see someone put some effort into the music behind the lyrics.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_209": "\nI agree with ylimemi... In a lot of music, you have to either sacrifice deep lyrics for a good tune, or sacrifice good music for deep lyrics.  There are some excellent songs with good lyrics and good music, but they are unfortunately in the minority.  \r\nIn the case of Eminem, and this song specifically, the lyrics are not something you want to listen to, and there is no musicality to speak of.  Why this music is popular is entirely beyond me.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_210": "\nI think the reason this is such a hit is because everything in the song was very realistic and Eminem showed his talent to put the scenario into test for letting his anger out on Kim before when she fucked him. Nevertheless I rate this song very highly and I recommend it, it does also bring back memories of Em, but I agree his songwriting skills and all sometimes feel like they are going unoticed and are pretty underrated. Well to me this song is a classic because everything was so intense in this song, but many credit nowadays goes to sappy rnb music today instead of some more powerful and realistic songs like 'Kim'.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_211": "\neminem is seriously disturbed\r\nhe sure does know how to demean women\r\nwhat a fucking ass hole is all i have to say\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_212": "\n^accusing him of being disturbed of something he did 7-8 years ago?

Yes, I have had g/f i loved cheat on me, then leave me for someone, and with a friend no less. But i would never wish anything in this song upon her. It's stupid to say that someone who does NOT want to torture and kill their S/O when they break up obviously didnt love them. Its COMPLETELY the other way around.\n\r\nIn short, i dont think that Em is sick and twisted, only that hes trying to appear that way to appeal to those who would idolize him as such. and in doing so gradually selling off whatever bonds he shares with kim and haille for money.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_217": "\nIn response to, deep breath, ylimemi- Music clearly hasn't become lyric centred. Take, for an example, you- You don't consider rappers songwriters. This is ridiculous, and obvious either out of a) your own stereotypes of hip hop (which I'd rather not hear) or b) a predisposed dislike for the genre. That's fine, each to their own, but to state that hip hop is centred around music and then also claim rappers aren't songwriters is ridiculous. \n\r\nTo the guy above me- Of course Eminem is doing it for the money. So is whatever musician you like. And you are not meant to take Kim, nor most songs with a similar premise off his first album, seriously. The people on this site who make the sort of comments you do are the exact sort of people he was targeting- People who blow lyrics like this out of proportion.\n\r\nUnfortunately, hip hop gets a bad rap nowadays because some, who are ill-informed, pass off hip hop based on their own stereotypes taken from the day's broadsheet. Please, people, cast whatever image off hip hop you have aside, and recognise that all this 'gun-toting gangstas' crap is a load of bollocks.\n\r\nSo too, is the stereotype of 'other people's music.' Yes, samples are used (for instance, the new non-hip-hop fan's darling Kanye West is a good example- most people who lambast hip hop for using samples adore the man, yet samples are the bread and butter of his work) but not always. The talented producer does not rely on them. \n\r\nAnd hip hop is a songwriter's genre. Yes, what you see on the muic channels and hear on the radio is usually bollocks, but that's the case with most genres of music- open your mind. Eminem's skills as a songwriter and rapper are underrated- By hip hop fans usually for the crime of either becoming commercially successful or nothing more than his heritage, and by rock fans for being a rapper who dares to intrude on mainstream radio. But, he is a talented rapper.\n\r\nDon't cast judgments on the genre before you've listened to the better stuff.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_218": "\nWOW!!! what album is this from?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_219": "\nan absolutely woeful song, in many ways.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_220": "\nIts a great song.

I have read most of the comments, and have heard a range in comments, going from Eminem is a lunatic, to he's just fantasizing, and I figured I would insert my own. To begin with, there is a such thing as poetic license. Just as authors write out murder mystery's, and poets write out suicidal poems, or playwrights base tragedies on people they know, Eminem, I believe, has based this song on his wife. He may not even have considered beating his wife in any way, but instead, just wanted to put his hurt into a new light, escalating his own thoughts so that it was listened to carefully. He is the type I could picture doing something like that. Its called dramatizing. Anyone heard of it? \n\r\nAnother thing, I have seen some people asking why he would of put down murdering his wife and child. HE DIDN'T. Read it again. Kim's boyfriend (who I believe she had married after divorcing Eminem) had a four year old son. He had murdered the boyfriend/husband, and the son came out, so he murdered him as well. He was planning on killing Kim and pinning the murder of the two on her, convincing the cops that she had murdered the two, then committed suicide. \n\r\nSorry to say people, but too many have commented without actually reading the lyrics, or listening to the song.

To Eminem's talent, this is what great art does, provoke us. Not only will a song so graphic in description bring up the subject matter to further investigate/inquiry about, but it's also very therapeutic to listen to. Many songs we just LISTEN to, Some songs we just HEAR, and once in awhile, a song comes along that we can actually FEEL. This song you can FEEL, I personally can relate/empathize with Eminem. However, I also do understand that granted on our relationship experience, many might not be able to relate to the angst/pain that Eminem conveys so artistically and amazing in this song too. Another thing about this song that makes it unique, is that it's not really a rap song. And this isn't to say that Eminem isn't a rapper and that this song is a sell-out. I believe that this song bears testament to the greatness of Eminem as a talented artist and as a entertainer. I couldn't imagine no other artist coming close to recording a song so dark, direct and mesmerizing. And in regard to those people who feel the need to take these lyrics literally (as in the physical sense of harm they echo - or scream), and also those who confuse Eminem the artist, with Marshall the man, I'll just leave with this profound quote: Art is a lie that helps us realize the truth.\"-Pablo Picasso. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_296": "\nthis song is eminem expressing how he feels inside, it's all about expression of his feelings, fucked up or not, it is what it is, you should not take eminems lyrics so seriously\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_297": "\nThis song actually sucks but I lLOVE Bonnie and Clyde.

Eminem is a straight piece of shit for that stunt he did, as it led her to want to take her own life, which would of left Eminems kids without a mother. Both Eminem and Kim would be to blame for Kim's death. Thank god she failed. Kids need both parents in their life, as much as possible. He actually wrote this song before he got with Dre. I beleive he wrote this song in 1997. I'm pretty sure that was the date. His first diss on her was in the early 90's.
