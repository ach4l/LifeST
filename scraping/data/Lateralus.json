{"comment_0": "\nHey guys, awesome interpretations so far.  Again this is everyone's THOUGHTS, so if I seem to dis anyone or anything by what I say, nothin bad intended.  I think it's great seein what other people think.  Anyway, on to the interpretation.\r\nTo begin with, I wanna clear up an earlier post.  Colsy said the title was pronounced \"Lateral-Us\" (A mistake i made too for a long time) but it's really pronounced \"Ladder-alice\" (say it and it makes sense, i found this in the FAQ from toolshed.net). Instead of \"Side of Us\", i think the song deals with lateral parts (the bigger picture, as maynard put it).  Anyway, it deals with the ability to have a physical life, as well as a spiritual one (In whatever god you chose to believe in).\r\n\"Black then white are all i see in my infancy\" (at birth and early on you only see what's plain to the human eye, the physical side of life)\r\n\"Red and yellow came to be, reaching out for me\" (how spiritual feelings creep up after sometime, and almost seem to make you realize a new side of life)\n\r\nTo keep from breaking down every line in the song (like i did on \"the grudge\") i'll just say that the next section deals with testing spiritual life (pushin that envelope, watching it bend, almost to see how far it will go). spiritual life takes you 'beyond the lines of reason'. \n\r\nYet he retracts these statements by talking about \"OVER thinking, and OVER analyzing\" (saying that there is a balance in spirit and body, don't push either ot the extreme, because you'll become separate humans, leading a LATERAL life)\r\nThen he speaks about reaching out to embrace the random.... possibly spiritual meaning saying that he holds on to a belief hoping that he can eventually find truth in it.\r\nThe next part seems to be my strongest point of backing.  he speaks about how he has the desire to do all of these wonderful (spiritual and physical) things, and he sums it all up by saying \r\n\"swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human\" (think about it... the lateral lives of body and spirit NEVER have to each other, they can stay completely separate, but he longs to bring them together, to SPIRAL them, and make such a connection to feel DIVINE but remain a HUMAN.)\n\r\nNext he backs my statement again.  He speaks of 'keeping his feet on the ground', yet he also talks about an enlightenment of somekind 'opening wide to suck it in and feeling it move across his skin'.\r\nHe wants that connection of body and spirit, as everyone does.  He'll continue to connect the 2 to push the boundaries and enlighten himself\r\n\"Spiral out, keep going....\"\n\r\nAnd interpretation is now done, thanks for botherin to read this terribly long post (as are all of mine, sorry bout that).  Anyway, continue writin posts, i love to read em, and again this is only my opinion.  Later...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis is one of the most brilliant songs ever written.  Like a complex novel, it operates on many levels, but the central theme of the song is evolution, both personal and on the grand scale.  First we'll examine the music itself.  Note that in the beginning the background beats/rhythms sound almost like a bubbling swamp, which is the source of life.  As the song progresses, those rhythms become more tribal, then more mechanical, till near the end we hear what sounds like robots in a factory.  Thus, the music is about the evolution of the human species to the point where we are either replaced by machines or become machines ourselves.  \n\r\nNow, the lyrics reinforce this theme on a few ways.  The song starts out: \"Black then white are all I see in my infancy, red and yellow then came to be reaching out to me, let's me see.\"  On a very literal level this is exactly how vision evolves in each human.  Babies see in black and white, with their ability to distinguish colors arising as they age.  But this is also true of the human species in a philosophical and spiritual sense.  Edward O. Wilson has written about how the most primitive tribes have words only for black and white; the next most advanced tribes have words for red and yellow, on up to the point where we recognize there is a near infinite color spectrum, which the most advanced cultures recognize.  Thus, the most morally developed beings recognize that issues can never be easily divided into black and white; that's much too simplistic.  There are, of course, people who still see moral issues in black and white, but they are throwbacks to our primitive heritage.  So as technology advances, if we do not evolve morally too, we lose our connection to nature more and more and become little more than machines.  Computers too view things in simplistic black and white terms (or bits and bytes if you prefer).  \n\r\nThus, in that context the song is about personal growth--spiritually, morally, and philosophically speaking.  when Maynard sings about pushing the envelope, he is saying that he is attempting to push beyond the 2-dimensional mores and prudish religious nonsense that still holds us back as a culture.  True spiritual growth cannot come from without; it must come from within, and no one else can define what is right or wrong for you.  In that sense this sing is kind of a companion piece to Hermann Hesse's novel 'Demian.'  \n\r\nAs the song approaches its denouement, Maynard approaches something on the order of mystical ecstasy and again the music reinforces the lyrics.  Note how the pitch of Maynard's voice, moving up and down rhythmically, compliments the \"spiral out\" he's singing about.  He leaves the rest ambiguous.  What lies beyond the simplistic black & white world we live in?  Who knows?  But the point is, we must push ahead anyway, no matter what, because the alternative is that we're no better than the machines we build to labor for us.  We MUST stop looking at the world as if it can be divided into easy categories.  The truth is never that simple.  We may not like what we find as we move on; nevertheless, we advance or we die, spiritually speaking.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song is a true work of art, something that the band want it to be seen as annd someting that i think is the most beautiful song ever written.

Likewise, as we mature spiritually we become capable of perceiving different aspects of reality that were previously completely unknown and unimaginable to us. A mystical experience is so alien to the everyday experiences of most people that describing it analogous to describing color to a colorblind person. Even if they can intellectually understand it, they can never truly \"know\" color without direct experience. Neither can anyone truly \"know\" divinity with a mere intellectual understanding of it.\n\r\n\"As below, so above and beyond, I imagine\r\nDrawn beyond the lines of reason.\r\nPush the envelope. Watch it bend.\"\r\nIn esoteric traditions \"As above, so below\" is an extremely famous phrase referring to the concept that the microcosm of the human is a representation of the macrocosm of the universe and vice versa; therefore through understanding one you understand the other. This is not a concept that can be rationally understood, hence it is \"drawn beyond the lines of reason.\" It can only be accurately perceived when the rational mind is pushed to its breaking point, when it can be transcended.\n\r\n\"Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.\r\nWithering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must\r\nFeed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.\"\r\nThe rational mind can only exist in a dualistic world, i.e. a world where subject and object, or the knower and the known, are separated. This duality is an illusion that is fooling the narrator, who must strengthen his will to see through the illusion.\n\r\n\"Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line.\r\nReaching out to embrace the random.\r\nReaching out to embrace whatever may come.\"\r\nIt takes a tremendous amount of willpower to cross the line from duality to unity. The individual never really knows what to expect when their ego becomes purified and they can perceive the infinite.\n\r\n\"I embrace my desire to\r\nFeel the rhythm, to feel connected\r\nEnough to step aside and weep like a widow\r\nTo feel inspired, to fathom the power,\r\nTo witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain,\r\nTo swing on the spiral\r\nOf our divinity and still be a human.\"\r\nThis is the desire for liberation from the chains of worldly existence, or to experience the Mystical unity of the universe. The joy of this unity is enough to make the narrator cry. \"The power,\" \"the beauty,\" \"the fountain,\" and \"the spiral\" are descriptions of divinity. \"The fountain\" probably refers to the fountain of life, while spirals are filled with esoteric significance relating to the golden ratio and DNA.\n\r\n\"With my feet upon the ground I lose myself\r\nBetween the sounds and open wide to suck it in,\r\nI feel it move across my skin.\r\nI'm reaching up and reaching out,\r\nI'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me.\r\nAnd following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been.\r\nWe'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.\"\r\nAfter this mystical experience, the narrator's desire to reach even further into to fabric of reality is intensified and they assert their intention to continue their spiritual evolution to its conclusion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\ni love this song. and i dont want to sound like a ....\r\nbut the title is LateralUs ... it was a printing mistake.\r\nI read it at toolband.com several weeks ago.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\ni love this song so much.....at the peak of the song towards the end i get tingles up my spine everytime i hear it.....one of tools best....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nI think this song is about how if you think too much you lose touch with your intuition, emotional and spiritual side. This song has helped me alot. I wrote an essay about how it compares to the book \"The Master and His Emissary\", which is about how in Western society we overuse the right hemisphere of our brains (the logical side) at the expense of our left hemisphere (the emotional and spiritual side). Here's my interpretation.\n\r\n\"Black then white are all I see in my infancy\": I saw things in a simple, inaccurate way, thanks partly to my society favouring the use of the right hemisphere of the brain.\r\n\"Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me, lets me see\": I began to see subtlety and complexity in life after I began to use my left hemisphere more.\n\r\n\"As below so above and beyond I Imagine\": a reference the Hermetic philosophy, patterns we notice on Earth can be extrapolated to apply to higher dimensions\r\n\"Drawn beyond the lines of reason ...\": Rational thinking has its own limits, for example logic can't justify the use of logic or give you a purpose for living. Life with only logic is empty, cold and meaningless.\n\r\n\"Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind\": Over use of the right hemisphere of the brain weakens your connection to the left hemisphere.\r\n\"Withering my intuition\": If you can't use your left hemisphere then you don't have access to intuition and creativity.\r\n\"And I must feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines\": Will power probably comes from the left hemisphere, it is the \"Master\" and the right hemisphere is its \"Emissary\" because only the left hemisphere can answer the question \"Why?\", to the right hemisphere everything is just a task to complete.\n\r\n\"There is so much more, and beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities\": There's alot of life experience I'm missing out on by not using my left hemisphere enough.\n\r\n\"Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line.\": Staying in the same old thinking patterns isn't going to lead me to new experiences.\r\n\"Reaching out to embrace the random. Reaching out to embrace whatever may come.\": Emotions, intuition and new experiences are random, I have to be okay with that if I want to live life to the fullest.\n\r\nAnd the rest of the song is how he feels once he has embraced his left hemisphere, his life feels more meaningful and less monotonous.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nOn the surface Lateralus is an amazing song in it's own right. The concept of Lateral-us is for an individual to view the themselves laterally - to view the world from outside one's own existence and see the bigger picture. The song uses the concept to \"spiral out\", to encourage the listener to evolve - to be more humane.\n\nBelow the surface is a surprising amount of metaphors and concepts adding much deeper meaning. These include the use of the Fibonacci sequence and references to alchemy as summarised below:\n\n1. The fibonacci sequence\n - Lyrics are introduced at 1.61... minutes - the golden/divine ration used by part of the Fibonacci sequence and divine proportions.\n - The time signatures of the song switch between 9/8, 8/8 and 7/8 - 987 being the 16th step of the Fibonacci sequences.\n - The chorus is sung in the pattern of the Fibonacci squence (i.e. 1-1-2-3-5-8-13 and back), noting at times steps are missed - implying some thing is missing.\n\n2. Alchemy (Jung)\nThe \"Magnum Opus\" is the alchemy process for creating the philospher's stone, a substance that can turn lead into gold (ref. to The Grudge). This required both chemical and spiritual aspects. Carl Jung drew on some of these ideas to explain the concept of the individuation process. The colours used in the chorus draw on following Jung concepts:\n - Nigredo (black) - Encoutering the unconcious mind\n - Albedo (white) - Purification of the unconcious thoughts\n - Critrinitas (yellow) - Confronting the Wise old man archetype.\n - Rubedo (red) - Discovering the true self\n\nWhen reviewing these details against the lyrics song adds much more meaning. There is not one meaning to this song, the abstract lyrics will have a personal meaning to each individual. This song simply put is encouraging the listener to strive towards being to being a better person.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nIf you read the book \"Nothing in this book is true, but it's exactly how things are\" you'll know exactly what this song is about. It's about sacred geometry and evolving to our next level of consciousness. That's just my opinion though.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nI don't think it's about racism, and for that matter, anything outside the body. Every time you go to sleep, your brain releases DMT, which can also be extracted from the plant it derives from, and smoked. The same thing is released in your brain when you die. When you go to sleep, your brain shuts off for approximately 7 hours and you go through a heavy psychedelic experience to another dimension and you wake up and just accept it. You can control your own reality by \"pushing the envelope\", \"over-analyzing\", \"over-thinking.\" It is said that you can basically peek into your own afterlife with DMT, but you can also achieve this without psychedelics, they just help. The mind is an amazing device and you can do anything you want. Your brain is your computer. It's really not any more complex than defragmenting your computer with a simple click of the mouse. You tell your brain what you want it do: Lose weight, be wealthy, successful, etc...Pick a target goal and give yourself reasons for why you deserve what you want and your brain will pull itself towards it like a magnet. And judging by most of Maynard's lyrics, especially 46&2, he's always referring to the mind and how incredible and endless the possibilities are; opening your third eye. You can do all this through meditation and focus, so I interpret this song as so.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nI personally think it has a very strong connection with Hermeticism. For example the line \"as above so below\" literally is in the Emerald Tablet from Hermes Trismegistus, it's a key aspect of the Hermetic tradition... \r\nPlus the spiral going outward... It's the Fibonacci number, this song as mentioned before is written in this style (1,2,3,5,8,...) When you represent it graphicly, it's a spiral that keeps growing outward more and more... \r\n\"Feel the rhythm\" Pythagoras said that the planets and stars moved according to mathematical equations, which corresponded to musical notes and thus produced a symphony. \r\nThis song is in my opinion filled with references to al these ancient ways of thinking, i'm not gonna go into it right now, but please! look these things up yourselves, discover these things, it's amazing! \r\nOne more thing.. To me this song also expresses the way you feel when you start realising these things, that there is much more \"beyond the lines of reason\", you really feel like you seperate your mind from your body, and you want \"to feel the moment\" of epiphany. You want to know the secrets, embrace the rhythm, you over analyze, you feel connected to everything, you literally want to ride the spiral to the end and find the truth... BUT the problem with a spiral is that it never ends!And you feel like you just lose yourself... \r\nThis may look like bullsh*t, but trust me if you have realised what i'm trying to say, you will understand... \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nOverall, anyone who is experienced in sheet music, time signatures, and math. Should realize that the time signatures go through shifts like so. 9/8,8/8,7/8 which if you read the top numbers it would read 987 which coincidentally is the 16th number in a pattern of numbers called the Fibonacci code. But that isn't the only reference to this code, the first verse will have a portion of the Fibonacci code (112358) which is quite convenient. That's not what the song means but I thought it was quite creative of Maynard and tool to decide to incorporate this sequence in their song. \nFor those curious the Fibonacci Code is an infinite sequence in which every number is equal to the sum of the two digits before it. For example, 1 1 is equal to 2 so the first three digits are 112 followed by 3. This code is related to Phi or the Golden ratio. And the mathematical spiral which can be laid over a number of things to find an infinite solutions. \nThis same concept was also used in Television, art, movies, architecture, etc. I.e. Criminal minds \"Mastermind\" in which the killer uses phi and the Fibonacci code to hide his victims.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\nI think that Maynard is again speaking about inner-self.\r\nGrowth. Things in life are simple, sometimes too simple\r\nand then we see that thing or things that opens our eyes\r\nto a little more. This leads to question ourselves and our environment. With this in mind, we must not let ourselves\r\ntake it so far that we miss out on opportunities and lose touch with our own intuitions. Like in all things there must be balance. The light of the moon when it's dark and the shade of a tree when it's bright.\r\nIt's obvious that Maynard is embracing these feelings or flags (red & yellow being colors to caution or alert.) that\r\ncome up causing him to question and grow. He is embracing his will and believes that it will cause him to encounter more in life. Take things for what they are, not what they appear to be....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\nA lot of good points have been made thus far, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a few things I want to touch on.  Many people interpret Maynard based on writings he has recommended.  While I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read many of his selected works, I feel his lyrics can be interpreted without a great deal of side research\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly in Lateralus.  So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue into the song\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\r\nWe are born into the world with no real sense of the world.  We start seeing things in black and white, good and bad, 1 or 0.  But as we become more aware of ourselves and the world around us, we see these distinct lines blur, new colors, new concepts, are all out there, waiting to be understood, and adapted into our own lives.  This is an eternal concept, starting ages ago for our ancestors, and will be for ages.  We are here to stretch our own minds.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOver thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \r\nThis is a key theme in the song.  It can be interpreted many ways.  I fist saw it as stating that over thinking, over analyzing is what differentiates the body from the mind.  The eye is not aware it is an eye, but the brain is.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference.  Thus, we are different from every other species of being we know of, in that we are aware, evolve, and grow.\r\nBut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only way to interpret it.   Looking at further lines, leads me to believe that he is saying that over-thinking, over-analyzing is what creates a void between thought and action.  Generally more contemplative people have a tendency to be more timid, a sociological concept that many may be familiar with.  Thus, we must somehow seek the inspiration to act on our ideas.  Rather than the usual black and white conversation, we must seek the strength to be open and honest about our ideas, our opinions, to leave ourselves vulnerable.\n\r\nHe continues to stress the need for inspiration.  Here it seems like Maynard is writing in retrospection\u00e2\u0080\u0094reliving the agonies he must have had before he began writing, and exposing his ideas to the public.  To reach out and be new, be bold, be daring.  Bewilderment is a sense of detachment from explanation, to have something new to contemplate\u00e2\u0080\u0094something new to consider.\n\r\nHe then reverts out of retrospection.  I feel the desire to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 followed by imagery that is incredibly poetic, and powerful, from sadness to elation.  Maynard then states, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto swing on the spiral of our divinity, and still be a human.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  I still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I understand this line\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it is essential.  From some reflection, he is essentially saying that we should continue to evolve, change, think, act, live, and love, to our fullest\u00e2\u0080\u0094become Godlike, or Christ-like if that image is clearer.  Maynard is emphasizing this urge throughout the song, because it is difficult.  So many things in society are constructed to block us from this goal.  We want to be open, honest, and loving, but in a society filled with cynicism and hate, we need courage and desire to be the best people we can be.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith my feet upon the ground I lose myself between the sounds\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Maynard states that he is just as much a part of Human kind as anyone else.  He is open to the world around him, and welcomes everything it has to offer, good or bad.  Maynard claims he is living by example, and compels us all to do the same.  Following our drives may just take humanity where no one has been.  After all, Maynard is not singing to Baby Boomers, or Soccer Moms, he is singing to societies youth.  By living our lives, we set examples for others, and future generations, so by living a life of better humanity, we can improve society for later generations.\n\r\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I can say for Lateralus now.  By walking through that song again I realized myself some new things in the song.  I think there is so much meaning in Lateralus that it will never be simply explained, I think it is designed for contemplation.\n\n\n", "comment_16": "\nIt is a song about spirituality.

'push the envelope, watch it bend'\n\r\n*for the 'over-thinking, over-analyzing' lines, see the comments of 'hoomanhah' above,who has some great ideas.\n\r\n*the 'I embrace my Desire to...Feel the rhythm, to Feel connected Enough to step aside and Weep like a widow...' is another great moment in this song. truly attentive tool fans will have noticed that this bit is an answer to the problem posed in the song 'H' on the Aenima album. there, the person was 'too connected to slip away, fade away...' but here, due to all the above factors, he is now 'connected enough to step aside' i.e. he (or she) has reached another level of awareness, which lets them step aside from damaging relationships, which was what H was all about.\n\r\n*my favourit line - 'to swing on the spiral of our divinity, and still be a human' - i could write a whole book just on these 13 words, but relax, i won't. in brief - by opening ourselves to the (Chaotic) world around us, by being aware enough to glimpse these 'infinite possibilities' we realize that there is no one controlling god - we are all gods, linked together. am i reading too much into it? well just look at the transparent liner notes for the album. on the last page, if you look carefully, you will see the word 'god' written into the persons brain. i.e. we are our own gods, we determine our (and our surrounding peoples/loved ones') fate. we can swing on the spiral of our divinity, a line which refers to the spirals i talked about earlier, i.e. here it specifically refers to the cosmos/galaxy, i.e. we can be one with ALL of our surroundings if we are open to them, but 'still be a human' and to be human is to 'embrace my desire' to 'feel' to 'weep' to 'fathom' to 'witness' to 'open wide' and 'embrace the random' not just to over-think and over-analyze, and if we gods can do that, then 'we'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no-ones been'.\n\r\n-thank you for taking the time to read this, i welcome any thoughts or opinions. stay human. \n\n\n", "comment_23": "\nOne of my friends (A huge fan of the band) told me this song is actually about a mathematical theory (Not Pi, a different one.) He said it's basically an endless spiral of numbers, and that is what this theory says makes up our psychical being. Hence, the song might be about following the lines of our own existence to wherever they may lead us. Basically dissecting our lives to discover what exactly 'humans' really are.\n\r\nI'm not sure if he's right, but it sounds pretty legit to me.\n\r\nI originally interpreted it to be that he's talking about ignoring society's set rules and set thoughts to discover the meaning behind emotion. 'Going where no one's been' could be describing learning the secrets of life and existence. What we know to be real is only real because we are taught that it is. For instance, if someone is born without the ability to see the lines, any set boundaries of sight at all, would they see in a giant mess of color because it all runs together, or would it all just be almost inconceivably blurry? What we see is what we are taught. To me this song symbolizes breaking from what we are taught to glean understanding of existence on our own.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_24": "\nThere is not much real deep meaning to this song.

The baby exists in 'black and white', it is what it is. At about aged 4 - 6 the child gradually begins to become aware of itself as being a form, and begins the (unnecessary) process of layering itself up with ideas, concepts, beliefs and self-image, hence the 'red and yellow'. When the narrator says 'lets me see' I interpret this as him seeing with his eyes in order to interpret the external as reality, rather than the internal 'true' reality.\n\r\nAs below so above and beyond I imagine,\r\ndrawn beyond the lines of reason.\r\nPush the envelope. Watch it bend.  --  The narrator seems to be conveying the common misconception that what is real on Earth must therefore apply also to what we cannot see 'above and beyond', drawn beyond the lines of reason, of what we can understand using reason and logic. The last line may refer to cause and effect.\n\r\nOver thinking, over analyzing,\r\nseparates the body from the mind.\r\nWithering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must\r\nfeed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.  --  The 'existence' within all of us doesn't require thought or analysis to be present. Thought and analysis take over intuition. We spend too much time and effort in thinking. Thought is simply a remembered past or an imagined future, hence the only true reality is this second, now. In over thinking and analysing we often miss what is right in front of us, so the narrator realises he has to will himself to let his 'moment' (the present) take him where it goes, without the distraction of thought.\n\r\nFeed my will to feel this moment, urging me to cross the line.\r\nReaching out to embrace the random. \r\nReaching out to embrace whatever may come.  --  Again, this refers to the narrator's attempts to become enlightened and to 'stay present' in the moment. Embracing the random and embracing whatever may come is the way in which to remain present, because what IS, simply IS.\n\r\nI embrace my desire to...\r\nI embrace my desire to...\r\nfeel the rhythm, \r\nto feel connected enough to step aside and weep like a widow,\r\nto feel inspired,\r\nto fathom the power, \r\nto witness the beauty, \r\nto bathe in the fountain, \r\nto swing on the spiral,\r\nto swing on the spiral,\r\nto swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human.  --  The lines in this verse all seem to refer to the feelings and experiences of becoming enlightened - 'feeling' the rhythm, feeling connected enough to allow feelings to 'be', witnessing true beauty is only possible when one has become enlightened. 'Swing on the spiral' is an interesting lyric alone as it may refer to numerous things. My thought is that a spiral could represent physical phenomena such as DNA and galaxies, or it could represent a singular path that we all must travel - one that has a beginning without, and ends at a point within.\n\r\nWith my feet upon the ground,\r\nI lose myself between the sounds and open wide to suck it in. \r\nI feel it move across my skin. \r\nI'm reaching up and reaching out. \r\nI'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me,\r\nwhatever will bewilder me.  --  Feet upon the ground possibly means that the narrator is aware that he is still human and that he still exists as a physical form, however he is able to 'lose himself' to the moment of simply 'being'. Some people who have experienced enlightenment or moments of enlightened awareness describe the feeling of tingling across the body, as though energy has permeated the physical body. Reaching up and reaching out could mean that the narrator is experiencing a spiritual transformation and is able to 'reach out' and understand more to his existence.\n\n\n\r\nLateralus Lyrics\r\nArtist(Band):Tool\r\nReview The Song (88)\tPrint the Lyrics\n\n\n\n\n\r\nBlack then white are all I see in my infancy.\r\nRed and yellow then came to be, \r\nreaching out to me, lets me see.\r\nAs below so above and beyond I imagine,\r\ndrawn beyond the lines of reason.\r\nPush the envelope.

Those who are not interested won't \"seek\" or find it important.   If MJK ever goes to that next step- to serve his listeners both art to be inspired by as well as access to the resources he knows damn well can transform a person --I'll be jumping up and down.  In the meantime - I'll write this and maybe some Tool fan who is \"ready\" will dive into the practice of getting your immortal groove on. \n\n\"Alchemy 1A\": a lot of these lyrics were copied straight from old hermetic-alchemy texts.  The whole color changing references symbolize a person's gradual (purification etc) and transmutation of the self-spirit.  You can google it and read it for yourself (keep in mind older terms like \"rubedo\" are used in place of the word \"red.\"  \n\nAs far as the sucking in air and feeling it across the skin etc. --perhaps he's making reference to one of the very first exercises or rituals performed by kaballists, alchemists etc. called the \"lesser ritual of the pentagram.\"  You can watch people perform it on Youtube.  If a person can get past \"feeling like a weirdo\" (ego) and really get into it, really practice it- an attitude of  \"infinite possibilities\" really begins to manifest and once a person starts to notice the interconnectedness of generating sound and new energies to what happens in your life - well, its pretty much a guarantee that you're gonna \"go\" somewhere unchartered.  Mysterious truths WILL be laid out before you.  No drugs required.\n\nI'm no Tool expert, but I'm familiar with a lot of occult materials and these lyrics are common utterances amongst practitioners. \n\nAnd the Grudge lyrics - if a person can't get past the self-destructive force of uncontrolled grudges -they will never be able to manipulate energy successfully.  But if they can get all fired up and DIRECT that energy toward some wound or weakness that in turn transforms something permanently within themselves--they permanently operate from a higher vibration in that area they were battling--they are making progress on a timeless soul level.   Perhaps you don't believe in reincarnation, but that's the whole point of working on transmutation from a deeper perspective than mere psychotherapy -its about the LONG long, long run.   \n\nA great, non-threatening place to start understanding some of the hidden knowledge Maynard has accessed is to read the book \"The Kybalion\" by three initiates.

Then, as many astral projection guides suggest, you see a white light envelop you. I believe \"red and yellow\" then refers to the colors you start seeing through your third eye that seem to be \"reaching out\" towards you and creating images in your mind (\"lets me see\").\n\n\"As below, so above and beyond, I imagine\nDrawn beyond the lines of reason.\nPush the envelope. Watch it bend.\"\n\nThere are different planes of existence, the one we reside in is \"below\" the astral plane. Actually, there is a whole plane in between the one we are in and the astral, so it is \"above and beyond\". These planes can't be factually or scientifically explained, it's more of a faith. Therefore, \"drawn beyond the lines of reason\". Many astral projectors experience a sort of wall when making that last push from our world to the next (\"push the envelope, watch it bend).\n\n\"Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.\nWithering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must\nFeed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.\"\n\nA huge obstacle in any intentional OOBE is \"over thinking, over analyzing\". The importance of remaining calm is largely stressed, when you think too much about it or get excited, it halts your progress making it impossible. The rest is about needing to get rid of human intuition because it's getting in the way of a spiritual adventure. His will to embrace the experience has to overcome the comfort of reasonable reality. \n\n\n\"...there is so much more\nAnd beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities.\"\n\nIt is said you can do, go, and see anything you want in the astral plane; \"Infinite possibilities\"!\n\n\n\"Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line.\nReaching out to embrace the random.\nReaching out to embrace whatever may come.\"\n\nAgain, referring to that wall. Needing will power to stay focused on pushing through the wall, or line to the other side. It is accompanied by a sensation of \"reaching out\" or floating up. \n\n\"I embrace my desire to\nFeel the rhythm, to feel connected\nEnough to step aside and weep like a widow\nTo feel inspired, to fathom the power,\nTo witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain,\nTo swing on the spiral\"\n\nThere is a rhythm during the experience, some feel a sensation of spinning or rocking back and forth. It is said that there is a tether, a silver 'rope' that connects you from your astral self to your human body. (feel connected) Going through the experience creates a very vulnerable feeling throughout your being, some have reported crying or intense fear after attempts. The spiral is something I've seen every single time I attempt OOBE's. I feel like the spiral is sucking me in and I'm swaying in rhythm with it.\n\n\"Of our divinity and still be a human.With my feet upon the ground I lose myself\nBetween the sounds and open wide to suck it in,\nI feel it move across my skin.\nI'm reaching up and reaching out,\nI'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me.\"\n\nThe higher planes of existence are considered to be divine, the highest plane being one of 'angels'. A common experience has been not only the sensation, but the visualization of standing up on oneself (with my feet upon the ground) as if it's solid ground. During the ripping down of the wall to the other side, you often hear many sounds. I have heard pretty frightening voices, and sounds that sound like sound. Lol makes sense right? The best I can explain it is like a sonic wave. \"Feel it move across my skin\" you get immense physical sensations of warmth and tingling throughout your body that starts from your extremities and moves uniformly. \"Reaching out and reaching up\", you're trying and trying to push through, move up and out. Like you're ripping up and out of your body.\n\n\"And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been.\nWe'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.\nSpiral out. Keep going, going\"\n\nWill is the most important attribute in astral projection. You must tell yourself you ARE going to project. Keep pushing and pushing. Don't let the fear of the spiraling sensation overcome your will. Ride the spiral out to push through to the other side and experience something that no one will ever experience the same way.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_36": "\nPEOPLE stop over analyzing the song!!! The lyrics are as straightforward as they come. Live for the moment and embrace every single part of life. The spiral simply refers to growing and learning from new experiences. Don't live in the past.. Don't over analyze. Live in the present and enjoy every moment of life that is thrown at you. Look up the fibonnacci spiral. It's a mathematical way of representing a spiral. The spiral continuously grows outward. This is exactly what Maynard wants every human to do... continue to grow and stay on the spiral and learn from new experiences. Use your body (which is just the physical way for your mind to interact with the physical world) and your mind to enjoy life. Recognize how lucky you are to be a part of this mind boggling world. Your body and mind are one and are reliant upon on each other. Without a body a mind is useless, without a mind a body is useless.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_37": "\nThis is quite possibly the most complex and universal song I have ever heard in my life. The centerpiece of this masterpiece is the concept of the Fibonacci Spiral; which is a shape that spans across the cosmos, from the DNA that is the foundation of our human forms, to the spiral arms that hold the stars above us (\"as below so above and beyond I imagine\"). However, there is a spiral that is on an even larger scope than that of the Fibonacci Spiral, and that is the Spiral of Evolution. The process of Evolution is merely the physical manifestation of something larger. Evolution is a process to describe only one organism, and that is the Self. We are all riding the Spiral of Evolution through the process of reincarnation. Each time we return to physical reality, we evolve a little more spiritually while simultaneously contributing to the physical process of evolution. \"Black then white are all I see\" refers to the duality consciousness of the brain. \"Red and yellow then came to be\" is the first and third chakras which are survival instinct and power leading one to question the limited paradigm of pure duality. Over-thinking things limits the power of our feelings and/or intuition which are much more powerful than intellect alone. All limits are merely waiting to be transcended through pushing the envelope. Sucking in the sounds of the universe will change you much quicker and more intensely than absorbing light through your eyes (\"open wide to suck it in, I feel it move across my skin\"). Cymatics is the science of how sound manipulates, sustains, as well as generates reality. \"Reaching out to embrace whatever may come\" is the acceptance and merging of the individual consciousness with cosmic consciousness (or the consciousness that powers the universe). \"We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been\" refers to the concept that we are all portions of Source/God/Consciousness/Spirit/Awareness, and so we desire to ride the spiral of evolution until Source can know itself in all forms and perspectives without going insane (for we are one with Source). Until that time, all we can do is spiral out.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_38": "\nI think this song is about Kundalini Awakening. Kundalini is a primal energy, like a serpent coiled at the base of the spine, a serpent of immense power, but which, for various reason, cannot escape from its confines for the time being. In awakened, the serpent force can arise through the channel in the spinal nerve, rise straight up to the brain and beyond, beyond into the astral.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_39": "\nBlack and white are what you actually only see as a baby, then the red and yellow cones in your eyes develop slowly allowing you to see color. \n\nSuch an amazing entry to this song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_40": "\nI heard Maynard talking about this song on a Joe Rogan podcast recently. He said the Fibonacci sequence was sort of an afterthought when they were writing this song, as he's not an expert on mathematics, but he sees the beauty of mathematics and nature, such as the Golden Ratio explored in Da Vinci's works. Although most mathematicians wouldn't claim the Golden Ratio is perfectly evident in nature, it does approximate it in many supposed instances, which is quite profound. Maynard is a very thoughtful and unique thinker. This track, to me, explores what he believes makes life worthwhile: finding the power of beauty, whether that's through art, music, mathematics, or personal relationships:\n\n\"I embrace my desire to\nFeel the rhythm, to feel connected\nEnough to step aside and weep like a widow\nTo feel inspired\nTo fathom the power\nTo witness the beauty\nTo bathe in the fountain\nTo swing on the spiral\nTo swing on the spiral to\n\nSwing on the spiral\nOf our divinity \nAnd still be a human\"\n\nAlthough Maynard is not a religious guy at all, I believe he still sees \"divinity\" in a way that invokes a notion of spirituality. He believes in something more than this materialistic world but, again, is not religious, and certainly not an adherent to monotheistic religion. You can appreciate the way religious individuals have referred to human nature as divine without needing to take their doctrines as factual. For example, the appreciation you have of the Sistine Chapel is enhanced if you empathise with Michelangelo's religious beliefs when you stand under his art, and whether you are religious yourself or not is irrelevant. Maynards notion of spirituality is closer to Eastern religions, hence why he talks about the Third Eye, and so forth. His appeal to mysticism doesn't necessarily mean he believes in a spiritual realm, but I believe he thinks one exists. I wouldn't bet on that; however, and I also wouldn't say Maynard is a convinced atheist.\n\nEspecially interesting is Maynard's adulation of creativity: \"infinite possibilities\". That's something inherently human \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we can dream up, imagine, and meditate on infinite possibilities, occurring on an endless spiral, and I imagine he could be referring to the infiniteness of fractals in this sense, which are present in much of Tool's artworks.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_41": "\nyes i know but it was writte on the cd like that and they didn't change Anemia did they?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_42": "\nfrom what i've been told by a few people is that when the band titles a song the same as the CD, they change the spelling of the song on the track listing. the same thing happens with the cd \"Aenima\" and the song \"Aenema\" I don't know if that's right, but it's what i've been told. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_43": "\nI totally agree.

That's the exact opposite of what Tool's music stands for.\n\r\nNow, about the song.  It has many meanings of course, this is the beauty of Tool.  But I think maybe one thing it means is how a baby views the world.  When a baby is born into the world he knows nothing.  He observes the world with an open mind to everything.  He doesn't know the purpose of things so he imagines them, because ,well, he has nothing better to do.\r\n\"Black then white are all I see in my infancy. \r\nred and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me. \r\nlets me see there is so much more \r\nand beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities. \r\nAs below, so above and beyond, I imagine \r\ndrawn outside the lines of reason. \r\nPush the envelope.

Also, a baby only sees black and white when they are born and other colors come later.\n\r\nHow would our lives be if we thought like this?  Not seeing any limits to what we do, \"to feel inspired.\"  And to be open to all and everything that comes our way.  To grow from every experience and grow beyond, what seems to be, our own limitations.\r\n\"Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line. \r\nReaching out to embrace the random. \r\nReaching out to embrace whatever may come.\"\n\r\nThis song is amazing and I think Lateralus is Tool's best album.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_52": "\nI love Tool\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_53": "\nTool consider themselves artists and rightly so:\r\nTrue art always has a differing impact on its audience as it allows us to draw not only from what is before us, but also into ourselves and from our own life experiences to form an interpretation.\r\nLook at all the different opinions of this song as an example of that.\n\r\nTo me this song does initially look at our perception of the world when we are young. Black and white represents opposites, good and evil, light and dark, and both are very straightforward shades, rather than colours \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because colours represent depth and complexity. \r\nAs we mature we begin to realise that the world is more than simply black and white. Not only does \u00e2\u0080\u009cred and yellow\u00e2\u0080\u009d represent the complexity of our world, but also the growth of the human ability to search and strive to understand our surroundings and the development of a... soul, if you like, which longs to know why we are here, what we are destined to become \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all the things that we can spend a lifetime searching for and possibly never discover.\n\r\nThus the line, \u00e2\u0080\u009cover thinking, over analysing, separates the body from the mind\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As we become too engrossed on what may be, we miss out on what is and what could be if only we were smart enough to recognise the opportunity. \r\nThe body is our physical form that will be with us in this life time and it is affected by all that is physical and tangible here on earth while we are alive.  And yet it is with our mind that we explore other existences and possibilities and exercise lateral thinking. I like what Hoomanha said \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe eye is not aware it is an eye, but the brain is\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The brain is our powerhouse of understanding, but our bodies allow us the amazing earthly experiences such as sight and hearing and touch. Humans have a mere pinpoint in an eternity to experience these things and yet we take a lot of it for granted; instead entwining ourselves by trying to understand the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbigger picture\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Maynard isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accusing humanity and saying that we are wrong for doing this \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he no doubt does it himself - but simply making an observation of humanity and encouraging us to look at our lives and what we are from a different perspective. \n\r\nAs the song draws closer to the end it incorporates terms such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cweep\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitness\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbathe\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeel (it move across my skin)\u00e2\u0080\u009d. These are all bodily experiences. Maynard also speaks of embracing a desire to feel connected. I think this is a willingness to experience a unity between mind and spirit and thus enjoying a fulfilled and satisfying life, knowing that you have embraced both to the best of your ability.     \r\nDespite the reference to \u00e2\u0080\u009criding a spiral\u00e2\u0080\u009d being a key point of this song, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m certain enough about my own opinion of what it might mean to include it.\n\r\nA fantastic song.

After a certain period of time(I am assuming seconds) the other colours come into our eyes.\n\r\nI am also assuming that red and yellow being the next two colours there are there for a reason, because of what they represent at a traffic light(stop, yeild).\n\r\nI think this song deals alot with the fact that when we are first born, and when we are young, we have the golden attitude. We arent worried about any appearances, anything at all for that matter, we just do whatever we feel like(only seeing black and white). But as you start to grow, rules and boundries are set into place that you must obide by.

Especially when they try to relate it to Maynards own life.  People do come up with some pretty good possible meanings, but when Maynard was writing these songs he probably had only one meaning in mind.\n\r\nDon't you think it's funny how people argue over the song meanings and get so angry.  The fact is that a song means whatever the listener wants it to mean, so there is no right and wrong interpretation.  Maynard writes a song about something that he feels and puts it out there on his albums, but there is no way that he could know how people are going to respond to or interpret it.  There's no way anyone can calculate all possible reactions of any public work because you do not think like everyone else.  So go ahead and write what you want to write.  If people flip out then they flip out, if people agree then they agree, it's that simple.  It doesn't mean that you shouldn't have said it.  If no one ever said or done anything offensive we would still be living in a dictatorship as serfs.  It's just important that you don't hold grudges against other people.

Another spiral, the golden mean spiral, is part of sacred geometry, and is considered perfect. As the spirals progress they come very close to being the same spiral, and some people think this is no coincidence. Life is constantly trying to become greater, to become perfect. So if we \"ride the spiral to the end\" the spirals may become one and we may just become perfect, or become greater than we can imagine.

I think tool writes their songs to inspire thought and stuff, but this is what the song means to me.

I suddenly felt an extreme swell of anger towards the one who had interupted my zen and forgot completely that she was my kin. So a raced towards her at incredible speeds and hurled myself through her stomach in a SPIRALING motion. I then realized what I had done and was forced to use my last ounce of time control power that i had been saving up to turn back time and delete the incident.

At first it took some getting used to for me since it was a little different but I disected it by verse so here it is:  \n\r\nVerse 1:Black then white are all i see in my infancy.\r\n              red and yellow then came to be, reaching \r\n                        out to me. \r\n              lets me see.\r\n              as below, so above and beyond, I imagine\r\n              drawn beyond the lines of reason.\r\n              Push the envelope. Watch it bend.\n\r\nmeaning to me:  It means that when he was young he was told (or knew) only two sides (IE right or wrong; left or right; up or down; heaven or hell; et cetera) but as he got older there were other factors (IE diagonal; 'white' lies; purgatory; et cetera) and the other factors called to him; they seemed more free, inviting if you will. They seemed abstract but at the same time normal.\n\r\nVerse 2:Over thinking, over analyzing separates the \r\n                body from the mind.\r\n             Withering my intuition, missing \r\n                 opportunities and I must\r\n              Feed my will to feel my moment drawing \r\n                  way outside the lines.\n\n\r\nmeaning to me:  the more you think about something; the more you use reason the less you rely on what you know. It basically says (to me) to live fore the moment every now and then.\n\r\nverse 3:  same as verse one.\n\r\nverse 4: over thinking, over analyzing separates the \r\n                 body from the mind.\r\n            Withering my intuition leaving opportunities \r\n                   behind.\r\n             Feed my will to feel this moment urging me \r\n                 to cross the line.\r\n             Reaching out to embrace the random. \r\n             Reaching out to embrace whatever may \r\n                   come.\n\n\r\nmeaning to me: verse 2 and that what your mind/heart knows takes over and lets him go for anything he wants; free from society.\n\r\nverse 5: I embrace my desire to\r\n            I embrace my desire to\r\n            feel the rhythm, to feel connected enough \r\n                  to step aside and weep like a widow\r\n            to feel inspired to fathom the power, to \r\n                 witness the beauty, \r\n            to bathe in the fountain, \r\n            to swing on the spiral \r\n            to swing on the spiral \r\n            to swing on the spiral of our divinity and still \r\n                be a human.\n\n\r\nmeaning to me: he finally gives into what he feels, you know-the beat of life of which you live for. He realizes that religion (whatever form it might be) should be a part of everyone not in one person... you control your destiny.\n\r\nverse 6:With my feet upon the ground I move myeslf between the sounds and open wide to suck it in. \r\nI feel it move across my skin. \r\nI'm reaching up and reaching out. I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me.\r\nwhat ever will bewilder me.\r\nAnd following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been.\r\nWe'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.\r\nSpiral out. Keep going.\r\nSpiral out. Keep going.\r\nSpiral out. Keep going.\r\nSpiral out. Keep going.\r\nSpiral out. Keep going.\n\n\r\nmeaning to me: he realizes where he's at and takes in everything he sees, hears, and feels.

The line is a wavy line almost like a sine wave the top of the line and the bottom of the line cross all the plains of the rainbow.  The full rainbow in total represents your full self or your soul.  This means by manipulating the \u00e2\u0080\u009cline of Physical reality\u00e2\u0080\u009d you can be open to anything that there is in the world that being what you can and cannot see.\n\r\nThis seems to explain to me the next part of the song.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs below, so above and beyond, I imagine \r\nDrawn beyond the lines of reason \r\nPush the envelope, watch it bend \n\r\nOver thinking, over analyzing, separate the body from the mind \r\nWithering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must \r\nFeed my will to feel my moment, drawing way outside the lines\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nAnd in the book it even says and I quote \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bottom and top loop-ends of the sine wave should be considered infinite in both directions. And there are many of those rainbows above and below \"ours.\"\n\r\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not far away from the actual words in the song.\n\r\nSo I think the song is about using your mind to go to every part of the soul at once then bringing everything together.  So that you can exist in both the Physical and Mental worlds at the same time.\n\r\nThe spiral bit of the song reminds me of the paintings by Alex Grey who done the cover art for the album.  In the painting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s he represents the path of the soul as a spiral.  So in this song I think Maynard is saying follow your soul and you \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay just go where no one's been\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\r\nOk I know what I mean lol but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to explain it all.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_184": "\nThis song is basically about Transfiguration.

I think Maynard picked this reference, to demonstrate that while as humans, we all have some notion of an afterlife, our perceptions of it as sculpted by the things we see around us, because ours minds will not stretch beyond that and therefore our perception of the afterlife could be way off because our brains will not allow us to go beyond what we know.\n\r\nI think the biggest clue to the meaning is in the title.\r\nSeperate the words and you get Lateral Us.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_191": "\nI agree with the idea of trying to reconcile belief with fact and the phsical with the spiritual. has anyone else noticed how the music, especially, if not only, in lateralus (the alulm), often reflects what maynard is trying to say.

Also playing in band doing alot of Tool's songs, I do think they are for people to also think for themselves, giving a message. To understand this I red this article that explains a hell of alot. And before anyone specifically interprets any Tool songs, read this if haven't already read it yourself somewhere else.......\n\r\nTo me, Tool's Lateralus is the most amazing piece of music ever composed. I think Tool deliberately wanted to give their fans something truly amazing, but wanted them to find it on their own. \"Recognize this as a holy gift...\" At first, I thought that the song Lateralus was about tripping acid - discovering true color by seperating the body from the mind. At first listen, I imagined the bending envelope as an intense visual. After becoming more familiar with the track, however, I had reformed my interpretation to something broader: think deeper. Lateralus, perhaps because it is the album's \"title track\", serves as the central clue for a puzzle that a friend of mine had read about somewhere on the internet. \"All I know is that there is a different order for the songs - something about two spirals. Oh yeah, and thirteen is in the middle.\" After scavenging through endless google search results, I gave up on finding more about this 'alternate order'. Intent to figure the album out, and very curious about the spirals - I put on the proverbial 'thinking cap'. I understood how the spirals could have a lot of significance, in that the album's title track offers the inspiring, \"swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human..........And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been. We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.\" In my internet scavenging, I had read one review, written by a drummer, who mentioned that Danny Carey's drum beat formed a fibonacci sequence during the song Lateralus. A drummer myself, I decided to get out the graph paper and follow Danny. I can't play like he can, but at least I can hear everything he's doing, and thus was able to construct the drum tabulature. Sure enough, Danny repeats a Fibonacci sequence through the number 13: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13. After 13, he starts again with 1. Bringing in my Algebra 2 knowledge of the Fibonacci sequence, when the equation for the Fibonacci sequence (which I don't actually know) is graphed, it forms a sprial whose vertex depends on the number at which the sequence begins. Coincidence? I began to think not. I had already known of Danny's obsession with sacred geometry and am familiar with Bob Frissell's book, Nothing in This Book Is True, But It's Exactly How Things Are , so the significance of what I had stumbled upon had actually begun to settle in. This is where I just had to play with Lateralus. I had doodled a few spirals in the corners of my graph paper, and in doing so made the first important connection to Lateralus. I knew that if the tracks were in fact intended to be heard in a different order, \"Parabol\" and \"Parabola\" would have to go together. In drawing my spirals, I had begun with a vertex and 'spiraled' outwards. After writing the numbers 1 through 13 linearly, I could immediately see that Parabol and Parabola would have to be the middle of my spiral (in that 13 / 2 = 6.5). I drew a simple arrow between 6 and 7 and then pondered the next pair. At first, I actually drew a spiral connecting pairs of numbers whose sum equaled 13 (the number of songs on the album). This, however, left the last track in the same position and without anything to connect to. At this time, I had used my copy of Lateralus and Cool Edit Pro to take out the silences between tracks and put the songs in the following order: 6,7,5,8,4,9,3,10,2,11,1,12,13. The transition from Parabola into Schism blew my mind, as the plucks, probably dismissed by listeners as a drawn out rant of an ending, perfectly transition into the beginning of Schism. When you count out beats as the strings are plucked, Schism resumes with the same time signature and tempo - mirroring the progression of notes. The transition from Schism into Ticks & Leeches is equally intriguing. Schism ends with strong double-kick bass and tom smacks, and Ticks & Leeches begins with what many would call a 'tribal' drum beat. The beat at the very start of Ticks & Leeches is slightly different every subsequent time it is repeated - the measures are two beats longer. Yup - you guessed it - those two beats are ACTUALLY the last two beats of Schism. I can honestly say that I never understood the album's fourth track, Mantra until reordering the album's songs. What I had originally heard as whale calls now had begun to resemble the worst imaginable dry heaves - or a stylized choking. Fitting, seeing as how the last line in Ticks & Leeches is \"I hope you choke.\" After this transition, none of those following it really seemed to make much sense. I certainly didn't like that Disposition and Reflection had been seperated - as they sound quite good when played sequentially on the album. This was the only real roadblock in my disciphering of the Holy Gift. Then I had remembered what my friend had told me - 13 was in the middle. At the time, probably just wanting to believe that there was more to this cd, I had equated this to the positioning of the song \"Intermission\" on the previous release, \u00c3\u0086nema. For the song to be in the 'middle' of the album it would have to be the seventh track in sequence, here having six tracks on either side of it. So I inserted Faaip de Oiad after Lateralus, and almost peed my pants when I discovered that (ever-so-faintly) the fading tone of the last note of Lateralus could be heard in beginning of Faaip de Oiad, and how the distortion of the guitars at the tail end of Lateralus resembled, and later transitioned seamlessly into, the static at the beginning of Faaip de Oiad. The lyrics of Lateralus justify this break in the spiral, almost instructing: \"spiral out, keep going, spiral out, keep going.\" I went back to Lateralus to find the next clue. In Danny Carey's amazingly competent Fibonacci sequence, he had stopped at 13 and gone back to 1. This is what I chose to do to finish the sequence. A second spiral was now constucted, and the order for the Holy Gift now became 6,7,5,8,4,9,13,1,12,2,11,3,10. Already many of you are probably fascinated at what I have revealed to you, but I can not even begin to tell you what this new order has opened up for me. The beauty of Lateralus is very, very fragile and has to be viewed with a very open mind. It can also be different when looked at from different points of view. Aside from the fact that the new order of the songs places them in an order where they flow together nicely - often ending and resuming on the same notes or within the same progression, and some times - in the case of Lateralus into Faaip de Oiad and The Grudge into Triad - even overlapping (though admittadly sound much better when actually electronically overlapped, this is kind of cheating. Consider this a hint, however, if you plan on doing this yourself), the two spirals help to tell a story that every Tool fan should hear. In the interest of not boring the only casually intrigued, I will try to keep this very brief. I would also recommend familiarizing yourselves with Frissell's book (yeah - the one I mentioned earlier). I consider Parabol and Parabola to be quite expository. Maynard wants us to know that no matter what happens, we must all know that this is not our only existance. Our very minds and the contents of our subconscious are intended to be immortal, and if we accept this into our lives (be it because of personal or religious reasons), it will be so. As such, pain is an illusion. At first, I called it \"The Lateralus Prophecy\" (for reasons you will soon understand), but I have since decided to call the 'reordered' version of Lateralus \"The Holy Gift\". As Maynard says, \"Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing,\" I take the word \"this\" to mean much more than just his simple cautioning. Since Parabola is the second track of the Holy Gift, it can be considered at the beginning (esp. considering the context of it's duality with Parabol), and as such, I interpret Maynard's words as more than just clever lyrics in a song. They are a plead for his listeners to listen to everything he has to say and truly celebrate the chance of immortality offered throughout. I would be lying if I said that each song has a specific translation. On the contrary, Tool's music is designed to make you think, not say something specific. It must be treated like great literature - much is hidden contextually. I will elude to Geometric-Drumming's previous post, where he explains the time signatures of Schism: \"It represents the title...it's arranged in 12/8 time which is SPLIT into 5/8 and 7/8 - which only really FITS as you PUT THE PIECES BACK TOGETHER.\" Where Geometric-Drumming claims Schism as his favorite Tool song, I have heard some fans say that it was a retched pick for the album's only single - but I think it was brilliant. Not to downplay the interpretations of those who have posted before me (in fact, I agree with much of what %BlueSoulRobot% has to say), but I think that to the casual listener who knows nothing of Tool, it can be a powerful invitation. Think about it - a lot of dingbats with MTV and a radio would walk around with the words \"I know the pieces fit\" in their heads. I wonder how many of them took the time to put the pieces back together to (re)discover what is trying to be communicated. I welcome any feedback. I would love to share interpretations of the songs via email - just too lengthy to post here. I would like to offer the following advice: DO NOT use MP3s to digitally reorder Lateralus. A lot of VERY IMPORTANT information is encoded on the actual cd. Ever notice how everyone who has lost or broken that cd has IMMEDIATELY gone out and bought a new copy? I know I have. It's because there are things encoded on the factory pressing of the cd that are lost in the mp3 compression process and any direct copy onto a cd-r. If you want to do it, do it right - I can't stress how important this is. Use the cda tracks as you put it together and maintain all audio fidelity using professional mixing software. \n\r\nThere's a Fibonacci in Maynard's lyrics, specifically the syllables: \n\r\nblack [1] \n\r\nthen [1] \n\r\nwhite are [2] \n\r\nall I see [3] \n\r\nin my infancy [5] \n\r\nred and yellow then came to be [8] \n\r\nreaching out to me [5] \n\r\nlets me see [3] \n\r\nthere is [2] \n\r\nso [1] \n\r\nmuch [1] \n\r\nmore and [2] \n\r\nbeckons me [3] \n\r\nto look through to these [5] \n\r\ninfinite possibilities [8] \n\r\nas below so above and beyond I imagine [13] \n\r\ndrawn outside the lines of reason [8] \n\r\npush the envelope [5] \n\r\nwatch it bend [3] \n\r\nI suppose it's not actually a true Fibonacci, since it does reverse itself. \n\r\nthe Fibonacci Sequence. It's basically a string of numbers that when you add a number to the number before it, you get the next number. Starting with the numbers 0 and 1. 0+1=1, so the set now looks like this; 0 1 1. You take the 1 and add the previous number (1) and you get 2. The sequence looks like this; 0 1 1 2. Now you take the 2 and add the previous number and get 3. Now you have 0 1 1 2 3. When you add the 3 and the 2 you get 5. 0 1 2 3 5. 5+3=8. 0 1 1 2 3 5 8.

I have several books on mathmatics and the geometry of design. ( I used to be a graphic designer) Architecture is often based on these numbers.

Leave these discussions to the artists that actually create. Others are obviously on this planet to mindlessly consume. \n\r\nThere is elegant subtlety in all forms of art. If you want to pick it up on a subliminal level, just listen. If you want to create, be open to receive inspiration from EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN. This is why I am fascinated by math and physics- there is beauty in it. I am also reading about myths and stories- anything you put your mind to can resurface somewhere in your art, whatever that is. What is your life's work? Creating can be simple or complicated, but one must remain aware and open-minded, remaining \"open wide to suck it in\" so to speak. \n\r\nI am a drummer as well, although not in the same league as you all, I certainly appreciate the passion for rhythm.  \n\r\nThe ones who say just get a fucking life do not understand that much of art, whether it be drumming, dancing, or architecture is based not just on what is, but what isn't. (silence, space) Someone who doesn't know any better will create an ad filled with as much crap as possible with little regard for the element of space- or rely on a template. A songwriter - most pop songs- will rely on a template as well. There is no temporal tension, or sensititvity as to where gaps or silences, no matter how small, should be placed. The whole world is really rhythm, if you think about it. Snowflakes, industrial design, poetry, music, tides, biorhythms. \n\r\nIf nobody understood and really thought about time and space in this matter, we would all still be in the dark ages. Anyone want to tell Leonardo da Vinci to get a life? \n\r\nAs far as overthinking, overanalyzing: \n\r\nOnce this stuff soaks into your subconscious, you then release it and watch what resurfaces- the body and the mind then join. You have to explore the external world first, then let the subconscious take over, to a certain degree. But to not even explore, and condemn others for doing so, is just sad. \n\r\nKeep pushing the envelope, guys. Thanks for some new perspectives, thanks for being awake and aware and alive and breathing. Thank God.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_223": "\nTaking another break from my work here..\n\r\nAnyone who thinks we are playing too much with numbers should study classical music theory. No parallel 4ths or 5ths, a certain harmonic chord progression must be observed, and many more mathematical rules. (If only Ashlee simpson could tell Mozart to get a life!)  And the math behind the music of Tool is part of what makes them what they are! Even Pop music has math in it, even though it's more like 2+2=4, abab structure, boring, undynamic, formulaic stuff with no suprises or tension, with a few exceptions. Like it or not, math and art often merge, and what we think is pure intuition or feeling is a result of careful study, even if those rules are eventually broken.

I have many views about this band and the message behind each song, but I don't have the time to type my comments and thoughts about each song. I will say that, as a whole, these songs are simply writen to influence us, as is all music and everything that appeals to us. And it is up to us to distinguish what is positve or negative. In todays world, it seems a persons worth, is simlified as a reflection of what tangeable things they surround themselves with; not what they know or feel. By listening to this band I have begun a journey of finding my piece of mind; each day I enjoy the wealth that Tool has helped me find.\r\n   Over the past several years of listening to Tool I have learned, self worth is strengthened by the ability to think for yourself, listen and learn from others, standup for what you believe in and most inportantly-walk with your head held high and be proud to be an individual; one who is vulnerable at times and strong as an oak at other times, and able to see all angles of a situation before making a determination of what is right and wrong, good or bad.\r\n     And the main thing, I believe, Tool wants, is for us as a society to share our thoughts: use them as a \"tool\". I have read more comments on this website than I can count, all of them showing each individuals own unique thoughts. So I tell you now, go, do, be, feel, and share with all that will listen-no one is wrong, if what they speak is there own thought.\n\r\nP.S.

Native americans have a technique called Splatter vision that goes into seeign everything around you just by looking at the area.  You can usually see 180 degfrees with it.  I think he's telling us to use our mental splatter vision and see everything, instead of the left and right of it.  \n\r\nIn the bible, it says \"what is order above shall be order below\" (to paraphrase) which i think is where the line \"as below so above and beyond I imganine\"  he then goes on to say \"drawn beyond the lines of reason, push the envelope, watch it bend\" which i think is him telling us to push away the things we are taught as children (such as religion which is the metaphor) and to make things the way we want and see them.  \n\r\nThe rest of the song pretty much builds off of that.  I love the lines in the bridge \"with my feet upon the ground I lose myself between the sound, and open wide to suck it in, I feel it move across my ski\"  he says to be earthly, stop focusing so much on the univrse and concurring all, but to simply enjoy the life you were handed.  \n\r\nSo the song is about beign yourself and refusing to except everything told to you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_267": "\nI might eat my words later on, but I personally think this is TOOL's best song to date....very inspirational\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_268": "\nMay I say, I have never tripped harder while listening to this song... zer0666 you have an excellent view on this song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_269": "\nBefore hearing Maynard's explanation that the \"Black, then White are, All I see, In my infancy, Red and yellow then came to be\" lyrics, my first impression was that they represented the races.

Astral Projection\r\n2.

It keeps your mind fully active. And what he means by the next line is that he has to forget about the future and past and focus on now to get through. Its basically a message to all Astral Travelers\n\r\nThe whole \"I embrace my...\" is  how desperate people are to get out. and how they will do anything to get out.\n\r\nThe rest of the song is a method to open your third eye. you try to get energy from the earth or the moon into your chakra, and how does he do this? By \"Reaching up and reaching out!\". this same thing could also be used as an astral projection method where you try to hurl yourself out.\r\nBut for the most part this whole song is about astral projection. You feel like you are spinning when approaching exit, so to swing on the spiral would make sense. \n\r\nTo climb the spiral to the end is to not let the vertigo interfere with your body and lose trying to get out basically. And to go where nobody's been is to finnally spiral out and keep going into the astral. \n\r\nThis song as well as Parabol/Parabola are both about Astral Projection, it seems as though maynard has mastered the art. :) for those of you traveling, meet him lol\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_294": "\nI embrace my desire to listen to this song all the time!

Well, it may have something to do with the church, the \"Rennes le Chateou\" an old church with a dark and secret past dealing with the Priory of Zion and supposed hidden treasure.

It clearly is no coincedense. And they show the spiral in the little packet for lateralus.

I'm now a Tool fan in one month time after I saw a concert of them in Belgium (I'm from there so...) and I can't get enough of them. Most metal lyrics are easily to understand, even though they can be seen as poetry. But with Tool, I really had to sing along with the lyrics beside me, or else I could not follow completely. And when you know them out of your head, you're starting to think what it could possibly mean. And that moment is so precious. When you think or know the meaning of the song, you feel wiser in a spiritual sense. You accomplished to reach a higher level through thinking deeper. It's like a spiritual orgasm. \r\nThis is one of my favourite Tool songs, it sounds beautiful, the writing is sublime and Maynard's voice is just hypnotic. The use of the Fibonacci numbers and to describe life as a spiritual, divine thing or even as a blessing is such a hopeful message. Singing this song out loud, is my meditation. \r\nTool is definitely the band for me, this spiritual progressive metal music is something I'm willing to believe in and it makes me feel alive. And I think a lot of people feel the same way about it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_328": "\nLately I've been dealing with an emotional crisis of sorts.  I'm completely smitten with this completely awesome girl, who apparently feels pretty much the same about me as I do about her.  The problem though, is that she's moving to another city to go to school within the next week, and neither one of us is willing to get into a long distance relationship, so we don't really know where we stand at this point.  I've been struggling with this for a few days, brooding, and turning options over and over in my head as is my wont, searching for resolution to my own internal conflict in this issue.  To at least some extant, I have found my resolution in this song.\n\r\nThe song follows a sort of psychological progression of thought.  The colors black and white are the extremes of the color spectrum.  The significance here is that in his 'infancy', before gaining experience and wisdom, the speaker thinks only in absolutes.  Always, never, forever, etc.  In the next line, \"red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me, lets me see,\" the speaker realizes that there is more to life than the stark absolutes of always and never.  Essentially, this song is about learning to take life as it comes.  Its about learning to not try and cram life in to a little box and try to force it to fit your preconception of what it should be.  Its about reaching out to embrace whatever may come.  I feel reasonably sure that when he wrote, Maynard's meaning is much more specific and personal as I think is the case with most of the things he writes.  However, when an artist publish a work, then it is up for interpretation.  It is up to the listener to decide what it means to him or her.  For me, this song has shown me that I must reach out and embrace whatever may come between me and this girl.  I don't presume to claim that this is the only interpretation of this song.  I think everyone needs to decide what it means for themselves.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_329": "\nWhile the last peice on the disc \"Resolution[all 3 parts]) is about the 3 final steps to enlightenment in particular, this song is more about the journey as a whole.

The song hints that this ratio is the very key to understanding the world. All things go back to this magic number. Watch the Darron Aranofsky film \"Pi\" if you can.

BUT... has anyone ever tried salvia?  It's a legal herb of the sage family.  It takes about two hits of extract 10x or 20x to throw you into an awesome trip for only about 10 or 15 minutes.  The trip is obviously different for everyone but myself and anyone I know that has tried it had one common experience.  1. you forget everything you know about life and you go to a place you don't exist that feels real and 2. The sense of something...something like a wall or a line of heat rushing from one end of your body to the other.  Everyone feels this rush through them when they try it.  My trip was somewhat close to the things he said in this song but the line \"I feel it move across my skin\" truly reminds me of this.  The rest of the song sounds like a trip also...but once again...who knows!!!  Has anyone ever tried salvia???  Try it out, it's legal, cheap, and non addictive or lethal.  Just get a sitter!!!  I bet you will feel the wall move across your skin.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_367": "\nOk. Here's my interpretation of this song. First let me go off on a quick, yet important tangent.)) Of course there is no way to say for sure if this or that is really what the song is about because more than likely the song was constructed to HAVE multiple meanings and to represent multiple things simultaneously.\n\r\nBut when an artist writes lyrics for a song, especially a thinking artist like Maynard or Adam, they have inspiration. Something they feel strongly about that inspires them to \"paint with words\".\n\r\nSo what do we know they have studied in the past?\r\nWell most interesting to me...PSYCHOLOGY. Jungian Psychology to be specific (46&2). And it wasn't that I had studied Jungian psychology first, and then recognized the meaning behind songs like 46&2, but rather the inverse. The song and it's lyrics pushed me to research about these things. That's the true power of art! The members of Tool are amazing artists because they can invoke thought, learning, self exploration which is tough to pull off. And it is my goal as a musician to do the same. That's true art. I have never listened to Britney Spears and then, inspired by the lyrics, gone out and learned about some new theories on globalization or physics...\n\r\nAnd before getting to Lateralus. I want to make one point about people idolizing and worshipping Tool. I'm not bashing anybody for doing it. I've done it myself! It's almost hard not to do. With so many great lyrics and such inspiration, cleansing, spiritual motivations to take from their songs. You almost want to call Maynard God and take everything he says as fact, as the way...but of course doing so would go against everything Maynard and the members of Tool believe in. Freewill. Questioning authority. Point being, question everything they say, as you would with anyone else, hold their words up to a bright light and form your own opinions. Maynard's lyrics are not a new bible for you or for me.\n\r\nAnd why do fans feel so strongly about Tool to the point where they almost worship, I would imagine for the same reason I do. Tool's music and lyrics explosed me to a world of thought that I had never yet been exposed to. The lyrics and music pointed me the way of a deep study of psychology, eastern religions, human nature and darwinism, fundamental religiousity and it's affect on society and individual's mental health, it's endless...sorry for getting off topic, about Lateralus, my favorite Tool song...\n\r\nThis song seems to be about an internal conflict between the hemispheres of the brain. One with logic and reason, 0's and 1's, black and whites, right and wrong, definity and distinct lines, and one with creativity, colors, blurred lines, inspiration, art, and spirituality.\n\r\nMaynard talks about his personal awakening, and his realization of this necessity for balance between left and right.\n\r\nThe references and the use of the fibonacci sequence is especially interesting. It's no doubt in my mind that \"spiralling out\" refers the the spirals created by the fibonacci sequence, which was clearly used in the \"black and white\" section of the song.\n\r\nI think what maynard discovered was that all this logic, all these numbers(1,1,2,3,5,8,13) just describe something immensely beautiful. The patterns found in nature are what we would describe as beauty. Maynard had first learned only to see the world in a very dry, logical perception. He saw the world in black in white, in equations, in numbers, and only later learned to get in touch with his other half. Witnessing the beauty described by these numbers. And as with a lot of Tool songs, it's at the end where he seems to expose himself and cleanse himself. It's true for everything in our world. Maynard says he wants to FEEL the rhythm. A rhythm is just a mathematical pattern put to sound, but to your creative side, it's something to feel. Something you can relate to, something that invokes emotions...if you let it. Also, I'd say with regard to the \"overthinking, overanalyzing separates the body from the mind\". It is true that overthinking, and obsessing, and being overly aware of your own conciousness can disconnect your body from your mind, and give you the same out of body experience you get from a lot of drugs, even weed. Not to say that it's a good thing or a bad thing, in this case I'd say it's a bad thing.\n\r\nAnd in conclusion, I think Maynard is describing his revelation. His choosing to open up his spiritual side. Drawing outside the lines, feeling emotion, feeling alive, feeling immortal, while still remaining human. \r\n\"...and still be a human.\"\r\nI think this recognizes the necessity for balance between the two hemispheres. It realizes he can embrace his spiritual side, and recognize how everything is connected(jungian psych), while still remaining human, endowed with reason, and logic.\n\r\nI'd love to hear responses to my take on this great song...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_368": "\nlets try this one :D\n\r\nOutward\n\r\nInward\n\r\nToo Far Inward?\n\r\nOutward Again :)\n\r\nInward Again :]\n\r\nToo Far Inward AGAIN!?!?? :P\n\r\nHere we go... balance... balance... got it!!!\n\r\nPeak :D\n\r\nI will just say that I use this song and milkdrop for winamp as the rather wild trolley ride from the parking lot to the theme park of life.\n\r\nAll the meaning that I looked for in this song for years...\r\nIs there even any there?\r\nOr does it just take me to the windowsill,\r\nForever watching and wondering?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_369": "\nIn meditation the ultimate path of enlightment is opening your third eye ( the sixth of seven chakra's).

Spiraling the physical and the metaphysivcal together to push foward onto the next step of evolution Hence the true meaning of (46 and 2).

First, think of the Fibonacci sequence.  The Fibonacci sequence is a pattern of numbers as such: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13...etc.  Each number is added to the preceding number to obtain the number that follows.  In the first lines of Lateralus, this sequence is used.  The use of the pattern is in the syllable sequence as well as pauses.  Between each pause are a number of syllables equal to the number pattern of the Fibonacci.  See:  Black (1) then (1) white are (2) all I see (3) in my in-fan-cy (5) red and yel-low then came to be (8) rea-ching out to me (5) lets me see (3).

I perceive the first two lines to be about being born.  Physically born?  Spiritually born?  I'm open to either.  Maybe those colors have to do with some spiritual practices or ideas out there I don't know about.  Anyway, the jist of this song to me is that the human mind can experience great things if allowed to simply recieve rather than try to throw an idea around to shape it into what it wants.  It criticizes analyzation due to it's ability to interfere with spiritual experiences. Simply stopping to feel the moment and letting your spirit speak rather than your mind can let you \"ride the spiral\" or basically let your intuition guide you to new experiences.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_373": "\nThis song is about the spiritual Evolution of man kind, it also shows the process of the third eye.

Real neat website here. \n\r\nAs for this song, I think that many people have glimpsed some true spiritual insight in this song. Maynard is very clever and makes his words such that they can mean many things to many people. Here is how I see these particular verses.\n\r\nAs I did yesterday with \"Third Eye\" I come at this from a Hindu philosophical perspective. To me he is describing yet again more aspects of awakening the consciousness upward along the cerebrospinal axis of the human body. As I mentioned before, each ascending chakra has a correlating Aum sound vibration. Also there is a corresponding color. Norse mythology mentions crossing the rainbow Bifrost bridge to Asgaard, home of the gods. This is an analogy for crossing the entire spectrum of colors inside the human animal ascending from red below to purple above, almost coming full perfect circle, striving to go all the way to divine inner consciousness. The microcosmic body of man is mirrored in the macrocosmic world we live in and the universe around us. A hint that there is a master craftsman behind the curtain of reality, pulling them superstrings and making the music of the spheres. \n\r\n   Red and yellow is all I see in my infancy. The beginning of the spiritual awakening process. Red is the bottom chakra. Literally. It represents the red hot molten core of the earth and the mud we excrete when we focus at the base of our beings. After that is orange, or water. The more liquid kidney focus, representing the water where it meets the shore. Beyond is yellow, third chakra or fire chakra. This is in the spinal collumn across from the stomach, where everything is burned and broken down. Material ignites and becomes more related to the air element. In the beginning, most people are governed subtly by these lower animalistic driving forces. Eating, ejaculating and excreting waste.\n\r\n  Green is across from the lungs, or air chakra. In the air, still tied to the earth is where vegetation reaches out. It is still related to the lower forces and begins life as we understand it. Air is above the lower elements.\n\r\nBeyond is the great blue yonder. The sky, which is actually a reflection of the water below. Up and down we go. The cervix chakra. Where the real contemplating begins. represented by outer space where ether is the element. \n\r\nPurple is royal self realization, the crown chakra. All that is beyond our normal perceptions. The Kutastha Chaitanya or \"Christ Consciousness' permeating all of creation. When you see that color and hear the ocean combined with thunder and the symphonic sound of everything else, Bingo. (-Ions) Thor is awakening!\n\r\n  Its easy when contemplating these conditions to think one might be overanalyzing and stretching to find hidden meaning in every thing. Paranoia is often the side dish of genius. But if you truly seek to find the divine within, you have to cross this rainbow bridge and join kermit on the other side in Asgaard. \n\r\n  Just my own opinions. I love that everybody can glean what they like from musical poetry of this calibre. To me, the 'spiral' is the construct of infinit space and eternal time combined. We only see pieces of it while experiencing space-time within. Like the swirling arms of a galaxy, the universe is similarly shaped and exists already in perfection stretching to eternity in dimensions beyond our limited 4. \n\r\n I also hear these lyrics slightly differently here:\n\r\nReaching out to embrace the random \r\nReaching out to embrace what HEAVEN may come\n\r\nSounds kooky, eh?

If you have experienced it, you'll understand.\n\r\nWith my feet upon the ground I move myself between the sounds\r\nAnd open wide to suck it in, I feel it move across my skin\r\nI'm reachin' up and reachin' out, I'm reachin' for the random or\r\nWhatever will bewilder me, whatever will bewilder me\r\nAnd following our will and wind, we may just go where no one's been\r\nWe'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been\n\r\n- this part i feel is about exploring yourself and the world around you, i think riding the spiral is a metaphor for the natural flow of exploration while being under the influence. as Dr. Thompson said 'buy the ticket, take the ride'\n\r\nSpiral out\r\nKeep going\r\nSpiral out\r\nKeep going\r\nSpiral out\r\nKeep going\r\nSpiral out!\r\nKeep going\n\r\n-the repitition in this part i believe to be an instruction to keep going and keep exploring, you never know what you might find.\n\r\nremember, this is only my interpritation. i hope ive connected with some people about this topic. i strongly feel this song is about exploration of ourselves spiritually, mentally and physically, and how we can learn to understand the world and our lives better. not neceserraly while on drugs (sorry for the contradiction) but they are a kind of sign post. and tool must have taken them.

But then later on, you begin to see more, the small details, the big questions, the other hues like red and yellow.\r\n\"As below, so above and beyond, I imagine\r\ndrawn beyond the lines of reason.\r\nPush the envelope. Watch it bend.\" \r\nThe lines 'as below, so above and beyond' I'm not too sure about, but maybe it's saying every part of him, from below to beyond (or maybe as he always has or as all humanity/life has been trying to do) is imagining outside what's considered normal and he is then telling you to do the same. To think outside the envelope and see what happens.\r\n\"Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.\r\nWithering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must\r\nFeed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.\"\r\nWhen you think too much and analyze everything before you actually act upon it is separating what you believe and think in your mind from your actions. And so you're not following your instincts and they're drying up, causing you to miss opportunities that would have come from those actions had you acted upon them. Then he's saying he has to fulfill his need to feel the moment even if it's out of the norm.\r\n\"Black then white are, all i see in my infancy.\r\nred and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me. \r\nlets me see\r\nthere is so much more and beckons me\r\nto look thru to these infinite possibilities.\" \r\nWith the addition of the 'there is so much more...' (though it could also be a different statement) it's saying that because he can see those red and yellow hues it's allowing him to see so much more than before, beckoning him to look into them and realize the infinite possibilities that they bring.\r\n\"As below, so above and beyond, I imagine\r\ndrawn outside the lines of reason.\r\nPush the envelope.

(I can't explain the \"move myself between the sounds\" very well, that's the best I could do.)\r\n\"I'm reaching up and reaching out. I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me.\r\nwhat ever will bewilder me.\"\r\nPretty much the same as the embracing the random part.

I just recently heard about this site which is why I hadn't written on this sooner (I made an account just to do this =)). This is the first time I've done this so please bare with whatever errors or philosophical holes there may be. I'm simply writing what this song means to me lyrically.\n\r\n I'm just gonna take this line by line, I see that there's already very similar posts to my ideal, but I think I might add some incite. Of course there are some things I don't understand, but it is Tool.\n\n\r\n\"Black then white are all I see in my infancy\r\nRed and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me, let's me see\"\n\r\nI saw someone suggest that this may have to do with skin colors, and why that may be true that's not what I'm thinking. This line is dealing with religious leaders or followers (or anyone, religious or not) that deal in extreme absolutes (i.e progressive or angry music is all bad; \"No matter what that song means it has an angry melody... can't be good\"). From what I've read about Maynard it seems that he justifies       with the idea that they open the mind to new ways of thinking and enhances certain ways of thinking, so that may be specifically what he's talking about. \n\r\nBlack and white represent absolutes, which is why I think he may be referring to religion. Having come from a religious background myself, I know how pushy some people can be with the ideals they've been molded into. Don't get me wrong, I'm actually an avid Christian, but the Church could definitely be reached out to and wrought out of the mold that older more formal church people have set them into.\n\n\r\n \"As below, so above and beyond, I imagine \r\nDrawn beyond the lines of reason \r\nPush the envelope, watch it bend\"\n\n\r\n  This line for me is saying that because I have been very low in life I can imagine the opposite \"above and beyond\".  My  thoughts have set my standards above the norm that I've been exposed to, this seems strange to others; their envelope is being pushed and all they can do is watch bend until something blows over (bends).\n\r\n \"Over thinking, over analyzing, separate the body from the mind \r\nWithering my intuition, missing opportunities...\"\n\n\r\nThis line is saying that over thinking can separate what you would like to do from what you do. If you do this you will miss opportunities that cannot be reachieved, you must not let your instincts (intuition) whither. \n\r\n\"...and I must \r\nFeed my will to feel my moment, drawing way outside the lines\"\n\r\n  This refers to a child's coloring book, teachers and day care workers will insist that you draw within the lines because the picture is set and you can't change it. That would be juvenile.\n\n\r\n \"There is so much more and beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities\"\n\r\n  This is reiterating what has been said earlier. There is a calling that goes beyond the status quo most of us have been exposed to. But there are other people and things that call us all to endless looked-over or seemingly grotesque  possibilities.\n\n\r\n \"Over thinking, over analyzing, separate the body from the mind \r\nWithering my intuition, leaving opportunities behind \"\n\r\nThis is the same as the first chorus except for \r\n      \"leaving opportunities behind\"\r\nwhich really just strengthens the idea that these opportunities are irretrievable and must not be missed. Life is special; every moment counts.\n\n\n\r\n \"Feed my will to feel this moment \r\n  Urging me to cross the line\r\n  Reaching out to embrace the random  \r\n Reaching out to embrace whatever may come\"\n\r\n  A line has been set-- either do what others have or be disowned. I think the writer of this song had looked for some sort of encouragement as he \"embraces the random\"\n\n\n\r\n \"I embrace my \r\nDesire to \r\nI embrace my \r\nDesire to \r\nFeel the rhythm, to \r\nFeel connected \r\nEnough to step aside and \r\nWeep like a widow, to \r\nFeel inspired, to \r\nFathom the power, to \r\nWitness the beauty, to \r\nBathe in the fountain, to \r\nSwing on the spiral, to \r\nSwing on the spiral, to\"\n\n\r\n   In this line, like much of the song, the writer has embraced his desire to do what others fear and     . This is not only suggesting the extreme, but doing whatever he feels and not be afraid of what the normal may think of him, but also to step aside when he feels things need to take care of themselves.\n\r\nTo  \"Swing on the spiral\" is completely a mystery to me, and though I've no idea what it means it doesn't dampen the songs impact on my life.\n\r\n \"Swing on the spiral of \r\nOur divinity and \r\nStill be a human \"\n\r\n Again, I have no idea what he is talking about interpret as you will.\n\n\n\r\n\"With my feet upon the ground I move myself between the sounds \r\nAnd open wide to suck it in, I feel it move across my skin \r\nI'm reachin' up and reachin' out, I'm reachin' for the random or \r\nWhatever will bewilder me, whatever will bewilder me \r\nAnd following our will and wind, we may just go where no one's been \r\nWe'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been\"\n\n\r\nThis line is much like the rest of the song, but with a big difference. This is more of a declaration than a statement or suggestion. The writer now knows what he must do and has the support of another party, and they must do whatever they feel called to. This may make your life very erratic, but it is a good way to find your 'calling'.\n\n\r\n \"Spiral out \r\nKeep going \r\nSpiral out \r\nKeep going \r\nSpiral out \r\nKeep going \r\nSpiral out! \r\nKeep going\"\n\r\nThe writer is now telling the opposing party to do as he has done and let their lives unwind to find who they really are, and though it may feel uncomfortable it's best to not stop.\n\n\r\nWell that's all I got. Hope this answered some questions. Please understand that the above is what this song means to me, you might interpret it differently than I, so feel free to post; spiral out.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_420": "\nWell thats very nice. I think it is quite one of their best work if not the best. Well the beginning of the song mentioning the colors follow the logic of how we as infants start seeing. The first colors we recognize is black then white then red and then yellow.. In our infancy we respond to sound. When you are a child and you hear music you naturally start moving to the rhythm. You feel the rhythm. Sound can be represented in waves that make a spiral. Just like the Golden Spiral in math, or the Fibonaci sequence wich is how the tempo and lyrics of the song are broken down. As a child when listening to the rythm they \" ... embrace my Desire to Feel the rhythm..\" Music, sounds, rhythm is what connect us.

Its saying that we, the collective audience and society in general, look to find an answer and meaning in something that does not HAVE to have meaning. I realise im being highly hypocritical with this analysis but i think its something every serious TOOL fan should consider. We are trying to find meaning and truth in lyrics and verse when we should be \"separating the body from the mind\" or in other words the physical context from the spiritual and intellectual. We shouldnt have to analise everything we do in life, we should take it as it comes and trust our intuition and emotional interpretations. How we initally FEEL about the song (including its musical elements) before we read the lyrics can be much more important the how we interpret the lyrics.\n\r\nThis of course is a much more general statement and is not confined to this song.

This is my own: \n\r\nIf you look at a bunch of key words, you will find a LOT of them relate directly to the creation of music. For example, \n\r\n\"Black and white are all I see in my infancy\"\r\nTo me, this means a plain, clear slate for creativity. For example, when in the studio, if you look at a sound compressor, or other metered equipment, they are pretty much black and white (plain/no lighting/etc). Some of them are actually black and white in color. Once  they are turned on, \"Red and Yellow they came to me\". The bars on the amps, compressors and every other metered sound equipment become \"red and yellow.\" \n\r\nWhen he speaks of \"so much more that beckons me, to look through to these infinite possibilities\"\n\r\nTo me, this means, there is an infinite amount of music arrangements, sounds, and creative factors (in terms of music).\n\r\nHe speaks of \"push the envelope, watch it bend\". \n\r\nAn envelope, used in sound terms, means:\r\nThe contours that affect the characteristics of a sound (pitch, tone and volume) over time. For example, when a string is plucked, its amplitude is suddenly very loud, but then dies out gradually. This describes the volume envelope of the sound.\"\n\r\nWhen he speaks of \"so much more that beckons me, to look through to these infinite possibilities\"\r\nUnlimited arrangements and sound manipulation regarding, vocals and other aspects.\n\r\n\"With my feet upon the ground I move myself between the sounds And open wide to suck it in, I feel it move across my skin, I'm reachin' up and reachin' out, I'm reachin' for the random or Whatever will bewilder me, whatever will bewilder me \"\n\r\nIMO, again, related to sound and the way it creates an emotion or inspires artistic creativity.

When squared, it leaves a smaller rectangle behind, which has the same golden ratio as the previous rectangle. The squaring can continue indefinitely with the same result. No other rectangle has this trait.\n\n\r\nWhen you connect a curve through the corners of these concentric rectangles, you have formed the golden spiral.

Nietzsche believed in eternal recurrence, the idea that we will live this life an infinite number of times over and nothing will change. we are just along for the ride in life, and instead of being bummed by this man is supposed to 'embrace' his situation and 'will' his life. This connects with the parts of the song about embracing the random and feeding the will to feel the moment.\n\r\nAlso, Nietzsche, like other existential philosophers, was critical of the philosophers of the time. He thought that living solely by reason and not by feeling was wrong ( check dionysus vs. apollo and \"Notes from Underground by Doestoyevsky). This relates to the outside of reason push the envelope part. \n\r\nSo this interpretation doesn't pertain to every line or anything, but hopefully it may add some to the discussion.

If you do these things you will better understand the symbolism in the songs. Tool is as a band, is exactly what it is in the dictionary. A tool. An instrument used to accomplish another task. The main concepts in Tools work is the evolution of the mind by overcoming your shadow. Your shadow being the thoughts and feelings that your unconscious harbors that prohibit you from being one with your self. Aenima and Lateralus are both about the process of overcoming this shadow. Or so to speak, stepping aside (laterally) and becoming one with your shadow (which is a very difficult process). And to become one with your shadow completes your Merkaba which is the completion of entering the third dimension of consciousness, or to reach the 48 chromosone, or to open your third eye. The key to discovering your shadow and to become one with it is to discover your inner most buried thoughts about certain subject matter, to understand it, and then to evolve. Aenima is two words combined into one. Anima is the soul, and enema is the flushing out of your system by means of washing (through the anus). Combine the two, Cleansing of the soul. Hence why the song enema is spelled differently than the album. \"Mom please flush it all away...Learn to swim\" Flushing of the little meaningless things that consume our life, and on to the new self. Becoming one with your shadow. If you were to look at the song Lateralus as a summary of the journey one takes to reach the third consciousness. \r\nBlack and white are all i see, then red and yellow came to me reaching out to me lets me see.

(Knowing he is going to leave everything safe behind but he has to step through now that he been given a glimpse of what may be. More and more does he realize that he needs to cross that line and venture on to this new level of consciousness)   I embrace my desire to....Fathom the power and witness the beauty ( Now willing to step aside and confront his inner most demons, in order to exceed beyond what was eventually holding him back from reaching new undiscovered enlightenment) Swing on the spiral and still be human ( swing on the spiral upwards to our new achieved enlightenment and still be  human, just with a new consciousness) \r\nWith my feet upon the ground I move myself between the sounds\r\nAnd open wide to suck it in, I feel it move across my skin\r\nI'm reachin' up and reachin' out, I'm reachin' for the random or\r\nWhatever will bewilder me, whatever will bewilder me\r\nAnd following our will and wind, we may just go where no one's been\r\nWe'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been \n\r\nThe new stage of enlightenment is now complete\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_465": "\nHe is now reborn\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_466": "\nSorry if i'm repeating something someone's already said, cuz i don't have the patience to read through eighteen pages of discussion, but i am SUCH  a bad Tool fan!

The reason this is so important is becuase with new discoveries of Quantum Physics, Alchemy is now proven possible (changing lead into gold). The whole theory of Alchemy is based upon the possibility of bending reality. I just finished reading a book called \"The Tao of Physics\" which is the parallels of Quantum physics with Eastern mysticism (Zen, Tao, ext..) To be quite honest, how similiar they are in theory is scary. This song takes the two and ties them together in a way. In lyric it reminds me of Zen, but in theory it reminds me of Quantum Physics with a little Alchemy. All three are very similiar.\n\r\nNote in The Grudge he uses (transmute these leaden anchors into gold)\r\nand in nearly all of Schism I find traces of the theory (I know the peices fit 'cause I watched them fall away).

Your divinity is your creativity, and to spiral out is to follow that creativity wherever it takes you. think of it as an inspirational song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_479": "\nWhat I got out of this is so much different than anyone else, but that's one of the many things I love about Tool. I got the idea that he was saying to all of his fans that his music isn't as ddep as we try to make it seem. Black & White at infancy could mean that when he was just starting out, his lyrics were black & white, nothing more. And as he and his band grew to become what they were today, yellow & red became apparent, through the eyes of his fans. \n\r\nTo help back my point, he says \"Over thinking, over analyzing, separate the body from the mind\".... \"Drawn beyond the lines of reason \r\nPush the envelope, watch it bend\"\r\n--- I think he is saying that when he releases songs, he watches his fans take his simple meanings and \"push the envelope\"; stretch his words to fit whatever they so choose.\n\r\nWell that's my interpretation of it anyway, but then again; maybe I'm just over analyzing it????\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_480": "\ni dont care if there are any haters of this song.  they cannot argue that the song is pure art.  thats so creative to incorporate a universal mathematical rule into a song.  he talks about fibonacci spiral and says lets try to ride it to the end.\n\r\nWe'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been \n\r\ngreat line.\n\r\nthats what I love about tool lyrics.  maynards attitude is generaly that people try to make deeper meanings to lyrics.  so he sometimes tries to make them ludacris but music means so much to us for no exact reason.  \n\r\n  \"Swing on the spiral of\r\nOur divinity and\r\nStill be a human\"\n\r\none of the most intuitive  songs i have ever heard.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_481": "\nBeautiful song! Full of wonderous messages and evocative power.\n\r\nWhat does this song say to me? Well, I'd like to analyze the lyrics.\n\r\nBlack\r\nAnd\r\nWhite are\r\nAll I see\r\nIn my infancy\n\r\nAs an infant, mobils are used to entertain and comfort you. mobils are color-coded, one at a time. The first mobil your parents may give you in a set would be black and white. This is a crucial bit. \n\r\nRed and yellow then came to be\r\nReaching out to me\r\nlets me see\n\r\nWonderful! The second mobil your parents may have given you is red and yellow. I was given these color-coded mobils when I was an infant, and many babies are as well.\n\r\nAs below, so above and beyond, I imagine \r\nDrawn beyond the lines of reason \r\nPush the envelope, watch it bend \n\r\nOver thinking, over analyzing, separate the body from the mind \r\nWithering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must \r\nFeed my will to feel my moment, drawing way outside the lines \n\r\nBlack then white are all I see in my infancy \r\nRed and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me, let's me see \r\nThere is so much more and beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities \n\r\nAs below, so above and beyond, I imagine \r\nDrawn outside the lines of reason \r\nPush the envelope, watch it bend \n\r\nOver thinking, over analyzing, separate the body from the mind \r\nWithering my intuition, leaving opportunities behind \n\r\nFeed my will to feel this moment \r\nUrging me to cross the line \r\nReaching out to embrace the random \r\nReaching out to embrace whatever may come \n\r\nI embrace my \r\nDesire to \r\nI embrace my \r\nDesire to \r\nFeel the rhythm, to \r\nFeel connected \r\nEnough to step aside and \r\nWeep like a widow, to \r\nFeel inspired, to \r\nFathom the power, to \r\nWitness the beauty, to \r\nBathe in the fountain, to \r\nSwing on the spiral, to \r\nSwing on the spiral, to \n\r\nSwing on the spiral of \r\nOur divinity and \r\nStill be a human \n\r\nWith my feet upon the ground I move myself between the sounds \r\nAnd open wide to suck it in, I feel it move across my skin \r\nI'm reachin' up and reachin' out, I'm reachin' for the random or \r\nWhatever will bewilder me, whatever will bewilder me \r\nAnd following our will and wind, we may just go where no one's been \r\nWe'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been \n\r\nSpiral out \r\nKeep going \r\nSpiral out \r\nKeep going \r\nSpiral out \r\nKeep going \r\nSpiral out! \r\nKeep going\n\r\nI know, a lot of text. But all of this is interpreted in few words. This song (to me) is a bit of advice. It tells people to stop living linearly, but to live as a spiral. To embrace the random, expect the unexpected, and reach out into what cannot be predicted. To reach and grow and extend infinitely.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_482": "\n\"Don't think...feel\"...are you f ucking kidding me?!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_483": "\nHey does anyone know if this is true and if so what song and cartoon.

There's a specific definition for it, but it's basically the idea of thinking outside the box, outside the realms of normal logic and reasoning.  It's very complex, so to better understand it, you'll have to look it up.\n\r\nCoupled with the fact that the music is awesomely composed in this song, the lyrics are, in my opinion, the best that Tool has written.  Therefore, lo and behold, this is my favorite Tool song of all time.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_486": "\nwell, i believe that red and yellow, and black and white refer to all the basic elements of life and that part of the song is describing the beginning of life which is learning and perceiving, he references that there is so much more, and that there are infinite possibilities, basically saying that the sky is the limit. the next part, i believe, has to do with base human passions, and not overcoming, but embracing and feeding them. the \"spiral\" he refers to is undoubtedly a synonym for life. he then seems to encourage people to live and love life. and to all the people who are saying\" stop overinterpreting the songs\" why are you even on this website?
