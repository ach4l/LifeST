I love this song because its got very beautiful lyrics and beautiful melody to it.\r\nJason Aldean writes about things he knows and this song he really knows. \r\nThe video was awesome! Every word in the song was portrayed in the video absolutley perfect. and the way he  put his daughter in the last shot when he was talking about how he and his wife had been waiting so lon and then she came along was perfect!!  She is so cute!\r\nby the way Jason Congrats on the new baby girl in your house and try to get some sleep will you!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI love this song so much as well!\n\r\nI like how he applied \"oh man, we...\" to three different situations. My favorite part has to be when he found out his wife was pregnant. \"I remember you comin' in and tellin' me the news. Oh man, we were living, goin crazy in the kitchen.\" I can picture this and it sounds fabulous.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
