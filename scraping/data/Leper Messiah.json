{"comment_0": "\nThe first time I read the lyrics to this song I thought they were condemning Christianity and religion in general, now that I reread them, however, they seem to be talking solely about corrupt churches with corrupt ministers, and not condemning Christianity as a whole. I'm suddenly reminded of hearing a story about how sometime in the 80s there was a preacher saying that God told him he would die if he didn't get one million dollars from his church. Ozzy Osbourne then sent the preacher a gun.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThe song, according to an interview with Metallica in the 80s, was written as a direct outcome of the televangelism scandal, where millions were given to two ministers who used it for their own personal gain rather than that of the church. The song reflects the control that religion, in specific, the Christian Church, has upon millions of people. They blindly follow their preachers and the story of a man who lived two thousand years ago, doing whatever their abstract lord says. I could go on with this for hours, but I won't, as this is not the place to do so. I was a member of the brainwashed elite for quite some time, but I've been questioning for quite awhile. A year or so ago, I left the Church and all organized religion behind and became agnostic. It remains as the best decision I've made in my life. This song reminds me of the chains I left behind.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nActually, according to one site I visited, It was about all these \"other\" so-called \"religions\" that make you think that you will be \"saved\" and you have to pay them to join and it's really all bullshit 'cuz they money is all there after.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nTraditionally, a leper messiah was someone who was brave enough to preach to the lepers. Leprosy was feared greatly and lepers were ostracized and sent to live by themselves. Most priests feared these colonies and refused to have anything to do with them.\n\r\nIn context of these lyrics, the phrase takes on a slightly different meaning. Metallica, specifically, uses the phrase to refer priests and preachers who use religion to appeal to those who feel disenfranchised and alone. However, they don't use religion to make these people feel better, instead they guilt them into donating money. The term is not used with fondness in the lyrics. Most people see these fly by night preachers as little better than con artists. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nMetallica is my favourite band, even though I am a Christian, which some people may find hard to believe. When I heard this song and \"The God That Failed\", I wanted to know why these songs were written, whether they had meaning or were just sticking their finger up at God. When I found out what the song \"The God That Failed\" meant, I felt quite bad as I felt I wrongly judged them. The same with this song, I thought it was taking the pee out of Jesus, saying that he was wrongly healing the lepers, now I know that it was about the       false prophets, I feel better about the band.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nIf you are an atheist, or agnotic, please read this and honestly give it some thought...\n\r\nYour belief that there is no God, or belief that there is nothing, is just as much of an act of faith as a Christian's belief IN God.  Just as a christian cannot \"prove\" the exitence of God, an atheist cannot prove that there is NO God.  Are you 100% sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no heaven, hell, or afterlife when you die?  Have you been dead?  You belive whatever you believe based on faith.  Faith that you are right.  Faith that whatever knowledge and facts you used to ascertain your conclusion is correct.  So there is no need to call anyone \"mindless\", or \"morons\" for practicing their faith, when that is exactly the same thing that the atheist is doing. Do you know everything there is to know?  If so, you would know the intimate details of the sex life of Napolian's great-grandmother's black cat's fleas.  With that as a baseline, would you say you maybe knew 1% of everthing there is to know? or even 1% of 1%?  I'm just saying it would be good that you be pretty knowledgeable before you go betting your eternity on what you know, or worse, what you don't know.\n\r\nIf you're a logical thinker and an atheist, I challenge you to read, \"God doesn't believe in Atheists\".  It's filled with logical examples like this. Atheists are nothing if not logical thinkers, and this book really appeals to that kind of reader.  In fact, if you are not quite sure what you are sure of regarding your belief in God and would like a copy of that book, email me at gsjones1234@gmail.com with your address or po box or whatever, and I will buy a copy from Amazon and have it sent to you, no questions asked.  If only one person receives the greatest gift God ever gave us through this, then it will have been worth the money. \n\r\nFor the record guys, Christianity is not about thinking you're better than anyone, or judging anyone for their sins, or trying to gather up $ from mindless masses.  PEOPLE do that.  Jesus did not like organized religeon for this very reason.  It's not God's fault when humans do evil in the name of God.  Don't condemn yourself to an eternal life away from God because you associate Him with the evil that men have done in the name of religion. \n\r\nWe're all sinners. It's human.  You can't be a good enough person to just go to heaven because you're a good guy.  It doesn't work like that.  That is not a good \"fall-back\" plan if you happen to be wrong about the whole atheism thing.  Have you ever been wrong about anything?  As much as heaven is a real place, so if hell. You need to be right about this.\n\r\nThe good news is that it doesn't cost a thing.  No payments to the \"Leper Messiah\" lol.  You just have to repent, and believe.  That's it.  Free as the air you breathe. Pretty good deal, especially when you consider the alternative.  It's all in the book mentioned above.  I was serious about that offer if anyone is still reading this board.  Maybe you're reading this for a reason.  I did not plan to come here to write all this.

(Also that Temple is Synagogue).\r\nAlso, that Martin Luther was a Catholic priest who \"reformed\" the Church to get rid of this.\r\nHowever, Luther condemned Jews to hell for not believing that Jesus was the only Son of God.\r\nIn Judaism, Every man is a Son of God, and every woman is a Daughter of God.\r\nDuring the 1930s and '40s, the Nazis used Christianity, Luther's book on Jews and the fact that Marx was anti-semitic, although he wrote the Communist Manifesto, to persecute Jews.  Nietzsche says that Christians think that if you don't believe you are going to Heaven for believing in the Resurrection and return of the \"Messiah\", then you are making an error \"in psychologicis\".  Nietzsche also says that all priests are parasites.  Christians, in general, I have found, think that they are \"better\" than other people.  In particular, the Nazis thought that the Aryan race was superior to all other races.\r\n  In a funny, strange, reverse twist, the anti-christians nowadays, like metallica, think that they are \"better\" for not being christians.\r\n  Actually, Nietzsche talked about the \"re-evaluation of all values\", where the Jews, by resenting the Nobles, who held them as slaves, wanted to destroy the Nobility, so they decided to destroy the Noble's value system.  What the nobles valued was called Good, whereas crucifixion was considered the most ignoble way to die.  You couldn't even be crucified if you were a Roman citizen. (Note: the Romans did not consider it a good thing to die for your country.  Death, in general, was not Good.  Death was Bad.)\r\n In any case, Nietzsche says that the \"Resurrection is the biggest lie ever told in history.\"  And that Paul needed the death on the Cross, and something else, (implying Life After Death).\r\nNietzsche says to never forget that Christianity exploits Death.  (It also says that life after death is a Promise!  But Jesus never talked about life after death.  He was basically talking about Life Before Death, how you treat your enemies, by loving them, not resisting them, so as not to create more evil.)\r\n(Hatred does not cease by hatred.  Only by love does hatred cease).\r\n  Nietzsche says (in The Anti-Christ), \"What did Christ deny?  Christ denied three things: the established church of his day, the Pharisees, and the Hypocrites.  Precisely everything that today is called Christian.  \r\n  Everything that today is called Christian, is, in reality, anti-Christian.  In fact, There Are No Christians Alive Today.)\r\n  Specifically, regarding so-called Tele-Evangelists: Nietzsche says that \"There was only One Evangel, , Bringer of Good-Tidings, and he DIED on the Cross, ALL the rest are Dysangels, (Bringers of Bad Tidings).\"  So, the word for the tv preachers should be \"tele-dysangelists\".   In that sense, Metallica is telling the truth, they are liars, liars, liars.\r\n  First of all, they are lying about the Resurrection.  Then the \"promise\" that if you Believe Jesus is Coming back that you will be \"redeemed\" or \"saved\".\r\n  Jethro Tull started this by saying, in Aqualung, \"If Jesus saves, then he better save himself.\"\r\nOne philosopher, Dr. Ben Mijuskovic, has a paper on Loneliness where he says that Christians are people who feel alone, or lonely, and their idea of God is a way of compensating for this.\r\n  In that sense, it is correct that preachers are preaching to the disenfranchised and the loners.\r\nIf you watch Michael Murdock, you see him talking about sowing seed and harvesting.  He talks about you sending him a thousand dollar seed.  And it will come back multiplied to you as a \"harvest\" of faith.\r\n  Faith is a mere belief that something will happen.  In philosophy, reason is the handmaiden of faith.\r\nTrying to prove a mere belief is really an uphill battle, as belief, for Plato, was like water in a river, it had no solid basis at all, like appearances.  Knowledge, for him, was solid, based on fact.\r\n  Language is like a knife in that it cuts up reality into \"facts\".  \n\r\nTraditionally, a leper messiah was someone who was brave enough to preach to the lepers. Leprosy was feared greatly and lepers were ostracized and sent to live by themselves. Most priests feared these colonies and refused to have anything to do with them.  There is a place in Hawaii for lepers.\n\r\nIn context of these lyrics, the phrase takes on a slightly different meaning. Metallica, specifically, uses the phrase to refer priests and preachers who use religion to appeal to those who feel disenfranchised and alone. However, they don't use religion to make these people feel better, instead they guilt them into donating money. The term is not used with fondness in the lyrics. Most people see these fly by night preachers as little better than con artists. \r\n  Nietzsche also mentions that Christianity is based on lies.  All of its premises are lies, the virgin birth, the Resurrection, the Ascension into Heaven (for Jesus, Mary and Mohammed!) are all lies.\r\n  It also Falls with the disproof of any one of these lies!  He also says that even sin and guilt are lies.  There is no real sin and no real guilt.\r\n Nevertheless, he mentions, that did not prevent the Salam witchhunters from killing women for being witches and women confessing to be witches.  (Actually, this was a landgrab by the men, from women who had land.)  He also mentions there is no such thing as \"motive\".  As in, Police are still hunting for the motive.  (Why? Because there is none, so they will never find it.)\n\n\n", "comment_75": "\nit's \"taken by his glamour\" not \"taken by this leper\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_76": "\nIt's not about spirituality, it's about organized religion and the cult-like aspects that suck people in and make them give their wealth and their selves over to a fake Christ, a \"Leper Messiah.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_77": "\nthese are good theories, but lepper messiah is virgil hetfield, james' pops. apparently he was quite the dick, though he seemed pretty tight in 'a year and a half in the life of metallica'\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_78": "\nIt is obvious that this is about evangelist preachers and their ilk asking for money etc..  \n\r\n     On a side note \n\r\n     Someone commented that atheism was a form of repression or perhaps that it was a hatred of religion.  certainly it is not the hatred of any religion, but the complete and total lack of a belief in any religion.

That might be where the leper messiah part kicks in. Like leperosy, Christianity was getting more and more powerful in a bad way; by lying. Then Martin Luther started realizing these flaws. He eventually created his own religion that had none of those flaws known as Lutheran. It eventually had a schism and turned into Protestant.

Leper is a term given to people with Leprosy. It's a skin disease causing victims to look... wierd.. to say the least. A long time ago, in the middle ages, people with Leprosy, Lepers they called them, were treated badly, like people with curses. They thought that Leprosy was very, very contagious.. even though we now know it's not. They had to abide special restrictions, such as not touching anyone, or anything in public unless it was their spouse. Whenever they walked the streets they had to ring bells or make loud noises to warn people. Later, Lepers would be round up and put into special towns, or camps, called Leprosaria, full of Lepers, and only Lepers. Huge quarantine camps is what they were. They were usually headed by religous leaders. Also, the more money you had, the better colony you got into.\n\r\nRefrence to money=Buying your way into a better camp.\n\r\nRefrence to circus \"cricus come to town\"=Again, people treated them pretty bad.
