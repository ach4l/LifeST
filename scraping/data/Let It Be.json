And it was so great to see her because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a wonderful ting about dreams: you actually are reunited with that person for a second; there they are and you appear to both be physically together again. It was so wonderful for me and she was very reassuring. In the dream she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be all right.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure if she used the words \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let it be\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but that was the gist of her advice, it was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry too much, it will turn out OK.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It was such a sweet dream I woke up thinking, Oh, it was really great to visit with her again. I felt very blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing the song \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet It Be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I literally started off \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mother Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which was her name, \u00e2\u0080\u0098When I find myself in times of trouble\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which I certainly found myself in. The song was based on that dream.\n\r\nMcCartney: Mother Mary makes it a quasi-religious thing, so you can take it that way. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m quite happy if people want to use it to shore up their faith. I have no problem with that. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great thing to have faith of any sort, particularly in the world we live in.\n\r\nLennon: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Paul. What can you say? Nothing to do with the Beatles. It could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been Wings. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thinking when he writes \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet It Be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think it was inspired by \u00e2\u0080\u009cBridge Over Troubled Water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my feeling, although I have nothing to go on. I know he wanted to write a \u00e2\u0080\u009cBridge Over Troubled Water.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\n(It should be noted that John was way off here because \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet It Be\u00e2\u0080\u009d was actually recorded well before \u00e2\u0080\u009cBridge Over Troubled Water\u00e2\u0080\u009d was released. Also I think George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beautiful guitar solo is an important part of the song.

Several \"famous\" folks shared their own stories about their battles with grief.  Paul McCartney explained that when he was going through a particularly troubling time in his life, one night, his departed mother came to him, clear as can be, and said to him, \"Let it be.\"  He explained that afterward, he was filled with a peaceful, almost blissful sense of well-being.  He wrote the song about his mother, Mary, coming to him and the rest is history.\n\r\nIndependent of this, other people have told me of lost loved ones coming to them during the night, very clear and present, and of having a more settled, peaceful sense of being afterwards.  Although I still wait and hope for some sign from my own mother, Paul's sharing of this experience, and recording it in song is emotional yet helpful.

I used the gospel version from the Across the Universe soundtrack.  To me, it resonated because losing him was the most difficult thing I've ever had to go through, and the process of coming to accept his death continues to be extremely difficult, especially considering he took his own life.  So it reminded me that the purpose behind his death is beyond my capacity to understand, and that I can make peace with it only by knowing that it was God's will, and I should just let it be.  It makes me cry every time I hear it.  It's a beautiful lyric, and it also speaks to me of a mother's wisdom and ability to comfort her grieving child.

There are certain situations that I cannot handle, and I remember having an emotional breakdown, bordering on a mental one, when this song played in the supermarket. A coincidence?

Paul wrote this about his mother who comes to him in his dreams and tells him that everything is going to be ok. Basically, because Paul lost his mother at such young age, he still seeks out her encouragement through hard times. Basiacally, it relates to everyone's need to be told that \"everything is going to get better, just relax.\" \n\r\nThis song is my favorite Beatle song, only because of the message that it provokes in me. My friend and I had a huge discussion about how it's a very discouraging song because he says \"There will be an answer, Let It Be\" and she says that this is like we have no control over our situations in life so we can't do anything to change them. I see that interpretation, however, I sense a more optimistic message in the song. Despite the melancoly music. I think it's saying, things get tough, yes, and sometimes you can't do much to change them, yes, but don't get worked up over things, Let It Be. The answers will come to u eventually. There is a answer if you search for it and maybe, when you least expect it, you will find it. \n\r\nPaul left this song up to much interpretation, as he does for most of his songs, sort of an auto-biographical song that isn't. That's what's amazing about it. A lot of ppl see religious ties into this song. Of course, ever since I was young I thought MOther Mary was the virgin mary and even now, I feel like it's not necessarily catholic based religious but it's definitely faith based and believing in something higher than yourself.

Her name was Mary. This song is about how he saw her in a dream which is very common  when a person looses a loved one. There is no deep meaning re church and/or Catholicism. It's about a boy trying to be comforted by the mother he has lot.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_154": "\npauls beliefs lret help come to himin this way lucky man but with one parent each dside ofthe irish war it must have comehard to start with but its given him a solid religious foundastion to grow from and hios songs are the greatest result i am glad he isa singer song wrihhter not a paperback wrighter hios songs an singinging are a greater contribution to world srt than any book could be so good lucknpaul may gods light shimne on you\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_155": "\nI also love that Lennon puts You Know My Name (Look Up the Number) on the B-side or to say in so many words if Paul says Let it Be, I'll say hey call me & the Paul music is becoming Muzak albeit Be is one of the best songs ever and an amazing universal self-help plus John is the biggest hypocrite ever because he became super Muzak and finally admitted all his songs after a point were Dog**** and then stayed at home and chained smoked pot while staring at the TV with the sound off until he went to bed.  Paul went out and conquered the world albeit in his Wings deal Denny Lane is falling over in the footage like he is decibel ten hammered so you know.  But at least he moved from point a to b in a pretty cool way..  But the B side in response to the =idea break-up was inevitable is very cool to me.  & you get many beautiful songs like Elizabet these days, great rockers with great production that are not just boring classic rock style but whatever you want to say about the Beatles who is that consistent in making music.  And #9 is the final war like Vietnam in the themes from that album about divorce and break-up with Yoko part of the rebellion from John.  And then Good Night is the peace after the storm- returning home to your child and the white cover represents that peace.  Very cool if if the Beatles are outdated now.  .  You also have to hear the '68 Christmas record where they are ripping on Mc.Cartney, Ob-La and other stuff and then George also gets in an all-time classic shot at John...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_156": "\nThere are few peoples who search for the Real origin and meanings of a song, therefore most of peoples dont know he wrote the song for his mother and they take It as a religious song like what I did at first\nso dont get angry at them\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_157": "\nVery few songs \"speak\" to me the way this one does.

It is like the phrase, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever will be, will be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Let God worry about it. The real message, no matter what you go through, is simply to accept it. Let everything go according to the divine plan. That is a key to happiness. It is a choice. We can each trust the universe, or God, or angels, to make our lives turn out for the best. This core belief is empowering and self-fulfilling. If we truly believe that everything works out for our own benefit, we align with the universe to make it so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet It Be\u00e2\u0080\u009d is written to accept everything we experience, but is particularly about accepting death. Everyone dies. Most of us live long enough that we must accept the death of loved ones . It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never easy. One time in an interview I said that the song was about that loss. I lied. \u00c2\u00a0 Since that time, I have had to deal with the loss of Linda. \u00c2\u00a0That was in 1998. It is frowned on by some for me to still miss her, but I did not stop living when she did. \u00c2\u00a0 Part of me is with her; but others loves have been great too. I enjoy marvelous relationships. However they are not replacements. People are not replaceable. \u00c2\u00a0 Each loved one is unique and wonderful. We can replace possessions, but not relationships. They continue. Everything in life must be allowed to be. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet It Be\u00e2\u0080\u009d was about the end of The Beatles, but was about the death of Paul more so. \u00c2\u00a0 This song has some of our best Paul clues. In a dream, my mother told me it will be all right. She wisely told me not to worry, and that everything would turn out as it should. It would be all right. The gist of her message was to \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet it be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Like Bob Marley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1977 song, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThree Little Birds,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the message was \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about a thing, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cause every little thing gonna be all right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet It Be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I sing of \u00e2\u0080\u009cbroken hearted people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Who are these people? What broke their hearts? These are people who are still \u00e2\u0080\u009cliving in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but grieve for those who are not, for those who \u00e2\u0080\u009cmay be parted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They grieve for those who have crossed over. Losing a loved one is like having part of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own heart cut out. It hurts physically and emotionally, but can eventually be healed by accepting what i. Why fight it? \u00c2\u00a0 Fretting about it, disagreeing with it, eating ourselves up over it, cannot change it. \u00c2\u00a0 It is not the way to peace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet It Be\u00e2\u0080\u009d teaches acceptance of Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. Between the familiar words, I whispered messages. \u00c2\u00a0I sing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhisper words of wisdom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0 Have you ever wondered what words of wisdom are whispered in that song? \u00c2\u00a0 The subconsciously heard truth to let be is hidden in that song after the words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthough they may be parted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0 Listen carefully, and maybe even turn that space up louder, to hear the whispered words of wisdom: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPaul is dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009dHear any other whispered words of wisdom? \u00c2\u00a0 Do you really want to? \u00c2\u00a0 Play it backwards. \u00c2\u00a0 Once, as I entered the studio, not long before writing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet It Be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I wondered what the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead\u00e2\u0080\u009d would sound like played backward. \u00c2\u00a0 I recorded it, played it backward, and heard something that was, to my \u00c2\u00a0 delight, compatible enough with, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet it be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0 Its wisdom, when put together, evoked much of the enlightenment of that hit song. \u00c2\u00a0 The message is, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead; let it be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0 It is time to accept his death and move on. \u00c2\u00a0 After recording a vocal track forward, I played it backward through my headphones, and dubbed over those words of truth and wisdom: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead. \u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead. \u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead. \u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When you hear me sing \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet it be. \u00c2\u00a0 Let it be. \u00c2\u00a0 Let it be. \u00c2\u00a0 Let it be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the forward direction, I am equally loudly singing \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead. \u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead. \u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead. \u00c2\u00a0 He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d going backward. \u00c2\u00a0 In this way, I let your mind consciously take in \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet it be\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the same time that you all subconsciously heard me express what it is that you should let be: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00c2\u00a0 Paul is dead. \u00c2\u00a0 Let it be.\n\nUharriet, Thomas E..
