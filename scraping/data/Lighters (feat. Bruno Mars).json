{"comment_0": "\nThis song is by far in my opinion, one of the greatest written songs that I have seen.  Eminem has some really great stuff, but this is just pure genius.\n\r\nBoth rappers are pretty clear about what they are trying to say, but there are some hidden messages for those who can't see them.\n\r\nEminem : \n\r\nHe starts off by saying by the time anyone hears this he would have already spiraled up.  In other words, by the time anyone knows whats going on, he is on his way to the top.  Like a virus spreading, he is going to set the world on fire.  In a good way of course.\n\r\nThen he says to those who weren't on his side, to watch out.  They better duck, or they are going to get struck down hard.  I believe when he says fighters, he is talking to his fans.  \"Fighters out your lighters up point them skyward\"  Perhaps lighters symbolizes fists?\n\r\nObviously he had a dream that he was king, and when he woke up, nothing changed.  He is on top of the hill, and no one can touch him.  He gives people the chance to disagree, but then says that it doesn't matter because he isn't going to make any excuses.  He is going to come out on top, and not you or anyone can stop him.\n\r\nHe talks about being cocky, and how he has to be.  P. Diddy talks about that in an interview once, how he had/has to believe he is the baddest mother F**ker in the game.  there is no option, this may be referencing that.  When your cocky, you believe that you are the best.  In order to do that, you need to believe in yourself, and what you are trying to accomplish.  When he references other people being slick, he is talking about them lying in their raps.  Rapping about things that aren't true to their heart, perhaps just for ratings/money.  Not sure who he is talking about, if anyone in particular.  \n\r\nthe rest of Eminem he is talking about how he was in a dark place, and came back from it.  Kind of like he talked about in Not Afraid a little bit at the end.  It's pretty amazing how he described it.  True artist.\n\r\nRoyce : \n\r\nAs for Royce, his rap has a different viewpoint.  He talks quickly about making a lot of money, and being successful.  With the Iron man Audi reference, but then he thanks Eminem for helping him out, like Dr. Dre did for Eminem.  Then he spends a good deal of time talking about his father.  I think this is the coolest part.  He says he wants to make enough money to retire his dad, since his father's back is bad.  \n\r\nHe then follows in Eminem's footsteps, and tells people that he is going straight to the top, and that no one is going to stop him.  He doesn't do it like Eminem, but if he sticks with Em, I'm sure we will be hearing a lot more from him!\n\r\nAs for Bruno Mars...I don't know aha.  Not a huge fan of him, although I don't mind him in this song.  Good touch to it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\n\"Excuse me if my head is too big for this building\r\nAnd pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick\r\nPoppin shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-of-shit\r\nWho you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite\r\nYou stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks\"\n\r\np.s. this is pure lyrical brilliance. Eminem is crazy good. Don't piss him off or he'll rip you to shreds. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\ni agree with everybody's interpretation of the rap section, and i think i pulled a meaning out of Bruno Mars. I think that he is continuing on what Eminem has said about his climb to the top and now he is at the top of his career.\n\r\n\"You and I know what it\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bds like to be kicked down\r\nForced to fight\r\nBut tonight we\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdre alright\"\n\r\nhe had many struggles that may have set him back and needed to get back to the top, but he made it and now he's living his dream.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\ncause it wasnt that long ago when marshal sat flustered lacked luster cause he coudnt cut mustard muster up nothing brain fuzzy cause hes buzzin woke up from that buzzer\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\n...with my arms out wide\n\n\n", "comment_5": "\nllooooveeee this songggggg. \r\ni think its about how they have been looked down upon by many people and have now worked their way up.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nlove it. @ellXo - i think you're right\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nWhat does \"A sky full of lighters\" mean? what do they mean by \"lighters\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nOMG!!!!!!!!!!

Not quite sure what Uno Mars is doing in here, or if his chorus has a certain meaning, but just on a broad aspect, I think that's what Em's and 5'9's is all about.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nThis song is so beautiful. The tension that Bruno Mar adds before and between the layers of intensity makes it truly pop. Everyone fights their fights, but it takes true passion to get past it and make it to the top. Win your battles and get where you want to be. You don't need hate or drugs. You need to have real feeling for what you're doing.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nWe're all right where we should be.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nomg this song is great\r\ni can totally relate to... amazing meaning n song\r\nlove it\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\nI think that the meaning to when Eminem says \"I came with 5'9 but I feel like I'm 6'8\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u0082\u00ac\u00c2\u00b3 is he means - I came with 5'9 = I came in new, not that many people new me, but I got signed to a record deal and got mentored by a great artist, like Royce is now. But I feel like I'm 6'8 = Now I'm mentoring someone new, helping him get big and noticed, like Dr. Dre did for me.
