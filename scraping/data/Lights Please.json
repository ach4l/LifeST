{"comment_0": "\nthis song is about Cole trying to put a young naive girl up on game about life, self-worth and how to win in this world. all she wants to do is give her body to him and wont listen to what he has to say. so instead he falls into her ignorance as well by havin sex with her. and then feelin bad but at the same time its like whatever so \"lights please\" lets do it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song has such a hot beat. And I love his voice on the track.  \r\nI like the social commentary mixed with the sexual.  It's freaky but so powerful. \n\r\n**Michael. JACKSON**\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song is about Naive, dumb girl cole tries to reach out to. He tries to talk with her about world problems and big issues but she refuses to listen because she just wants to have sex. He talks about how easy it is to just give in to her instead of try to reason with her and the pride he feels knowing that she is all his, even if it is only for that moment.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThe song has a double meaning. The girl as his fans and the sex referring to his popular songs such as, No Role Modelz, Work Out, Etc. While trying to show the real world with songs like Rich Niggaz, Love Yourz, Break Down, etc. the girl (his fans) always seems to be nieve when talking about the real world. Since the sex (popular songs) seems to relieve him of his pain,\"for now everything just seems so right, and how you make the darkness seem so bright\", he always seems to give in.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
