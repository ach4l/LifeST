{"comment_0": "\nThe song is basically about the rap wars and how much the danger of being hurt or killed by your rivals is highly possible. Eminem sings a little about most of his feuds with multiple artists and the video is just what could possibly happen to someone from his crew due to all of the fighting between the groups. The person that dies in the video actually dies 2 years later after the song was made. He was shot in a bar after shooting someone over a game of pool.\n\r\nThere are some people that he has named, I will try to clarify the situation.\n\r\nBenzino is an older rapper, whom had control over Source magazine for a while and used it to bash on Eminem and even made a new album with a lot of songs directed to Eminem and I'm assuming that Eminem believed Benzino was irrelevant to everything that was going on and decided to try to be on top of the rap game by starting drama with him.\n\r\n50 Cent's feud is said to be started in his words that Ja Rule was robbed out of his jewelry and Ja Rule thought 50 Cent had something to do with it and Ja Rule said that 50 Cent was jealous over the fact that when he was making videos in his 'hood, he got a lot of love from the people there. That's when they started to make diss song at each other with Ja Rule and Murder Inc artists and 50 Cent with his G-Unit. 50 Cent was nearly killed after being shot 9 times. It's said that a local drug kingpin sent the hit after 50 Cent made an album that exposed Murder Inc's illegal activties with the said drug dealer. It's also believed that the same drug dealer killed Jam Master Jay for helping out 50 Cent make and send the album and pretty much taught 50 Cent how to actually make music. 50 Cent later joined in Eminem's record label and Ja Rule threatened Eminem and Dre to not make any diss songs about him and they didn't until Dre produced a 50 Cent song that pretty much destroyed Ja Rule and his family and that's when Ja Rule came out with ''Loose Change'' and it was directed to Dre and Eminem and people from their labels and that's when Eminem/D12, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent/G-Unit battled Ja Rule/Murder Inc and other artists for a while. There was a time where Dre and Eminem talked with 50 Cent to try kill the drama with Ja Rule, but Ja Rule was talking and joking about how he was the one that stabbed 50 Cent in a club and that continued the fued. It was actually Black Child from Murder Inc that stabbed 50 Cent because he thought he was pulling out a gun.\n\r\nNow to the Suge Knight thing. Eminem wasn't afraid of Suge Knight, he just didn't attack Suge Knight out of respect for his friend Dr. Dre who told him to stay out of it because it wasn't his beef and wanted to do things by himself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI don't usually listen to Eminem, but these lyrics are so raw and real I just had to comment. He talks about trying to be the responsible person in a world of immature rappers. He doesn't want to lose his temper but when the people he cherishes the most are involved then it's war. He just sounds so mature, and I like how with this song he basically says how he knows what's right from wrong but he will fight to the end for his loved ones.

It is people like you and other lame critics that try to \"ban\" his songs or try to keep kids from listening to or buying his music. Rap Haters and critics are just scared that we (the listeners) will actually listen to what the rappers are telling us to do. Rap is portrayed as being a terrible, malicious thing, but in reality it is just an honest way of expressing thoughts. We listen to people like Eminem because we can relate to him because he isn't fake and uses language that normal Americans can understand.

(See Various Religions such as Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity) ;)\n\r\nSecond Point is\r\n2)\"but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily mean what they have to say is significant. For clarity, my argument is that a significant portion of \u00e2\u0080\u0098rap\u00e2\u0080\u0099 music is detestable.\"\n\r\nThat rap music is detestable?? \r\nOK firstly if you dont like rap music why the fuck are you writing a review on an artist who is a RAPPER, if you find the genre, rap detestable. \r\nAnother point i picked up on you was when you type your reviews, whats the deal with you adding things like (see US Supreme Court) bla bla bla bla.\r\nWHO GIVES A FUCK, you think your reference to backing your answer is making you text sense? \r\nHELL NO....NO-1 GIVES A SHIT!!!!! & BTW we aint in a fucking court case, your opinions your opinion. \n\r\n3) & Finally my last point\r\n\"As a civilised person, I don't see how settling verbal disputes (or \u00e2\u0080\u0098beef\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as you people call it) must always end in violence.\"\n\r\nPlease define the word \"Civilized Person\" & \"Ordinary\"\r\nSomeone who has an \"Ordinary\" house and works in an \"Ordinary\" job, works 9-5 has a wife and kids & the family is in perfect harmony\n\r\nIs that a \"Normal\" & \"Civilised\" person??? \r\nAlso wtf do you mean \"BEEF as YOU people call it\"\n\r\nWould you like to explain what that means \"YOU PEOPLE\" \r\nAre we less \"civilised\" than you as you count yourself \"Ordinary\"??\n\r\nPersonally my OPINION (as i am allowed to give one unless im libel) is this, your opinion on this song is not needed. If you have nothing good to say and do not listen to Rap or Hip-Hop dont bother commenting on something you know nothing or very little about.\n\r\nKind Regards \r\nX-T-C\n\r\n>8D\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_79": "\nAnyways, I was wondering if any of you know the significance of the comments regarding the receptionist at the source?

He is an awesome lyricist and truly has talent. The reason he is so popular is not solely because of his persona or lyrics, it is because he made something out of nothing. Growing up in Detroit may not have been the easiest lifestyle for Eminem when he was a child. This is what inspired him to become what he is today. He doesn't make music to please people, he makes music to vent his emotions, speak his opinion, and/or just have fun with his musical talent. I stumbled across this site because I was curious as to what word was edited from the explicit version of Like Toy Soldiers, but I didn't expect to find so much controversy. Take Eminem for what he is worth to YOU, for everyone is entitled to their own opinion.\n\r\nI'm sure Eminem's music serves as a motivating/comforting factor for many underprivileged youths who know exactly what it was like to grow up in similar households. For others, it may just be entertainment, however, to those that it truly means something to, don't let so-called \"educated people\" dictate what is good or bad music. Often times these critics have never felt what it was like to come from nothing and become something.\n\r\n...and that's all I have to say about that.Edited by random_monkey on January 29 2006, at 09:24AM\n\n\n", "comment_115": "\ni agree\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_116": "\nim not a big eminem fan but after hearing the song \"like toy soldiers\" its opened my eyes about how talented eminem really is. i thought the whole biggie vs tupacfued was fucked up and i for one was devastated when they died over something so small. i thank eminem for bringing out this song and reminding people today what namecalling can lead to. i think ja needs to wake up and realise exactly what is going on. and to reverendtm.

They simply had a fallout and cannot work together, so they chose to work against eachother. Suge is the (?). But you want to know something, it's actually quite obvious? Eminem doesn't want to be another victim himself especially, and Suge is not somebody to mess with, Suge is a murderer and a bully. That's why Eminem won't mention him, despite Eminem hates the guy and is afraid of him.\n\r\nEminem has always had a very dark sense of humour, most of his rhymes about other people were indirect blows, usually funny ones...he made a whole track of ICP giving oral to eachother...that doesn't mean he's apologizing for it, they wouldn't kill him over it, they probably laughed and got a little pissed off.\n\r\nThe Ja / 50 thing is obviously a big focus. Ja had the audacity to throw in verses about Em's kid, what kind of punk is Ja? I would knowck him out myself if he wasn't surrounded by protection all the time. He basically said \"Your girl will be a whore and an addict\", despite the fact that Em is a great father and she will grow up to be just fine. Possibly with minor troubles as all famous people's kids get, but she will not be like her mother unless Em loses his custody (which will never happen). Even still, Kim is recovering from her issues, Eminem saying the things he has about her doesn't help, but in a way she deserves it.\n\r\nAnyway, I'm getting off topic. Let's talk about 50 for a minute. 50 had two major attempts on his life just because he was good at his game. He has good reason for his ways of calling out wannabe gangstas, they hired someone to kill him because they couldn't do it themselves. 50's beef is a very serious one. Em's beefs are because he isn't afraid to tease people who deserve to be teased, and now some of them are taking it overboard, by threatning and even killing his people. Now he's caught up in the 50 thing for producing \"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\" and letting it hit the stores. But Ja deserves what was said about him, 50 had to defend himself, or he would become a punk just like those he calls out in his raps.\n\r\nThis song is about all of the feuds, not just the ones mentioned specifically. There are problems we don't even hear about, and for good reason. The people involved are just way too vicious. I'm surprised Em even wrote the Suge thing, obviously Suge has said something about Em, now that he is so close to Dre. Although it's comical in a way, Suge even hung Vanilla Ice out a window once and was about to drop him to his death, all in an attempt to extort money (note - Suge and extort used in the same verse, definately coincidental, though). That is the type of person Suge is. Em and 50 have no problem going after the wannabes. But Em won't dare mention Suge. Suge's methods of running a business is pretty much ike the mob used to run the garbage business in New York.\n\r\nEm didn't use ICP for fanbase, yes the flyers exist, I know because I actually have one on my wall. The thing is, though, Em didn't make the flyers, and ICP would say they would be there a couple times, and sometimes whoever made the flyers would be told to put that information on them but the promoters.\n\r\nOne thing I am wondering, is that the Vibe Award incident hapened mid November, and the Encore album was released mid-December. The song was probably already written and all before the incident, which makes the song somewhat of a prediction of something that could have been worse than it was. Put a few things together, you may have a conspiracy theory. Em is about to release something mentioning Suge, Suge already hates Dre, Suge hires someone to go after Dre for allowing Em to put the song out. Last minute decision of censoring Suge's name would make sense, wouldn't it?\n\r\nThe rap game is full of this stuff and has been since the early 90s. The song is a very forward attempt to get these wannabes, and true gangstas to stop what they are doing, because enough has happened already. You get all the talkers and all the doers not knowing who's who anymore and people get attacked or killed over things like money or label issues and the like.\n\r\nGood job, Em...never drop out, unless a life depends on it, just like you said!Edited by random_monkey on January 29 2006, at 09:25AM\n\n\n", "comment_122": "\nBadder Santa,\r\nI agree that this song is about all the feuds, and I agree with your last sentence.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_123": "\nphermone_cult: I just read your post again, I doubt I read it the first time because I had such a headache from everyone else...\r\nEMINEM DOES NOT RIP OFF ANYBODY!!!\n\r\nIf you knew your history of music, rap has it's roots burried deep many cultures. Aerosmith comes close to rap often times. Elvis took black music and introduced it to white people. Reggae is often a form of rap, and white people taught the Jamaicans to speak english, just not in a favorable way. Eric Clapton did a lot of blues, I wouldn't call him a rip-off.\n\r\nA bit off topic...but a challenge in another area...\r\nBlack gangs try to follow the old methods of the mob, who were Italan. Italians didn't rap, but does that mean the Crip/Blood rivalry is a rip-off of the old crime families' disputes? I dare you to call a Blood a rip-off...\n\r\nAs for people who knock different forms of music, open your eyes. Music was once very segregated hundreds of years ago. As time progressed and cultures intertwined, diferent forms of music evolved. By the 1900s with the inventions of different recording media, we saw the evolution of blues, jazz, rock, metal, etc. Now look at the past 20 years, we are seeing Aerosmith and Run DMC together, Jay-Z and Linkin Park collaberating, DMX and Marilyn Manson doing a rap, Gwen Steffani and Mobi, Gwen and Eve, Kid Rock and Eminem, Kid Rock and Sherryl Crow, Sum 41 doing metal, rap, and alternative all in one song...I could go on there are dozens of songs where the rap/rock lines are being blurred. If these people can all get along in the music world, why can't people like pheramone_cult see the light?\n\r\nLook out for your future, more of this will come, and Eminem is just another major breakthrough in the world of tossing out the steretypes and mixing the styles.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_124": "\nI reall ylike Martika: Toy Soldiers, and i think this song kinda spoils it .

Your beliefs might be that class is contingent upon what you accomplish in life, however the beliefs of others may differ and very well be right in his/her own case. No one is any better than anyone else in this world. What university you attend in no way effects how people will rank and/or classify you. I'd say, with your egotistical tendencies, you'd rank pretty low on most lists. I'm in no way impressed by you, nor am I intimidated (which I've concluded must be one of your motives, what with your constant babble of \"top 20 universities\" and \"additional jobs\", I'm certain you must have these people SHAKING IN THEIR BOOTS). \n\r\nIf one believes that Eminem is a fit role model for standing up in a gangster's world and being the first bigger man, their reasons as to having Eminem as a role model are entirely suitable.

Maybe I'm lacking the logic that undertakes a vengeance as such. \n\r\nRegardless, I just can't be swayed into agreeing with anything Eminem writes. Moby summed it up well in an interview responding to his diss from \"Without Me\": he basically said that he couldn't take Eminem's new approach seriously when just a few videos back, he was running around in a Bin Laden costume. \n\r\nI'm also really sick of the whole playing up the \"Hailie\" deal. Criticizing Ja Rule for mentioning his daughter's name on a track is understandable. However, with lyrics like \"bitch I'ma kill you\" and \"you gonna hate me more when you find out you can't escape me, whore\", I again, have trouble empathizing with his so-called morality and maturity, especially as a parent. \n\r\n\"em is the best thing that happened to rap, anyone who cant see that is just plain stupid\" \n\r\nThis poster (and many others) may be right about plain, but not stupid. If you think songs like \"Kill You\" and \"Shit On You\" are epitomes of the greatness in hip hop culture, you sure are missing out. Have some pride in what you listen to and represent. It's crazy how an artist like this is idolized while lyrical geniuses (with TRUE messages) like Talib Kweli and Common are left ignored. \n\r\nOpen your eyes, people.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_172": "\nUh-oh.

That included I beleive unreleased stuff that Death Row had not laid claim to yet.\n\r\nDre left Death Row and started Aftermath Records. Soon after, Tupac Shakur was murdered in Las Vegas with Suge in the car. Many have long thought Suge had something to do with the Tupac hit, as he was about to leave Death Row as well and audit them for some $10 million they owed him.\n\r\nEm says this line because Suge has had his other rappers and himself diss Dre for being fake and for deserting Death Row. Dre has tried to let it go, but Suge keeps trying to push his buttons.\n\r\nEm never knew Suge and wasn't there for their falling out, thus he would be \"talkin' about something, I knew nothing about\". However, Suge was \"all over TV, down talkin a man (Dre), who literally saved my life\" and Em felt he now had to answer somewhat to Suge because of how loyal he is to Dre.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_185": "\nI Luv It..N I Really Hate Ja..I Like..*Fuck It 50 Smash Em Mash Em N let Him Have It*\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_186": "\nhey guys! can you please look up RANE &  post some thoughts about a song or two.  i'd really appreciate it.

Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but how about doing that in the forums? This is for talking about what the song means. I just read through 8 pages of mostly bickering. And I did read through each and every comment, and if you were to do the same you'd see how childish it all is. Bickering over spelling and grammar and how much money you all make? Frankly, I don't care what you do for a living or how much money you make or what have you. Also, as long as what you are writing is legible and understand able, I'm sorry, it doesn't make you any less intelligent if you mispell a word or create a grammatically incorrect sentence. I'm sure we all understand what is written, and if we don't, oh well, move on to something else. Or ask for clarification. \n\r\nAlso, people that don't like Eminem? you're entitled to your opinion. But by coming to this page and saying you don't like eminem, and that you can say that because you're entitled to your opinion, you're very plainly looking to start trouble. Honestly, can you tell me that if someone went to your favorite song or band's site and said they sucked, wouldn't you defend them? I'm sure you would, and if you wouldn't, then I suppose they aren't really your favorite, are they?\n\r\nFinally, why do people continuously ask the same questions over and over? If, instead of going to the end of the comments and asking a question that's clearly been answered forty times and getting angry when it's not answered again, why not read the comments before you send one, and perhaps your answer will be there? I realize that's a lot to ask on a page like this where there's pointless crap in between every meaningful addition, but skim. do your best. Don't post the same question forty times. \n\r\nSorry, had to get that off my chest. \n\r\nI do like Eminem, and I feel this is a powerful song in that it really is a message to his fans NOT to be stupid. A lot of problems with \"beefs\" between artists stem from media hype and fans getting angry at one another. Eminem doesn't want that. Yes, he stirs up his fair share of trouble, and I won't say I respect every one of his songs, but a song like this one DOES send a powerful message, and I think that's hard to disagree with.\n\r\nAlso, an artists lyrics are his/her personal business. They create them from themselves, their experiences, and their views.  So, if you don't agree with what they say, that's fine, because you're not them. get over it.\n\r\nAnd, with that I'm going to apologize for my billion word entry to an already overflowing comment page. \n\r\n-Z\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_191": "\nThe MAIN message of this song really has to be that he's tired of all the shit he has got his \"crew\"(as we can all tell im white) into and now he has decided to let it all go so he doesn't go and get one of his \"hommies\" shot.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_192": "\nWell, everyone sems to ask over and over \"What does toy soldiers mean.

He sings from the heart in many of his songs. He raps to a different beat (ah-hah-hah, pun fully intended) than most rappers.

However, I'm not so narrowminded as to immediately write off every song that is produced by a rapper, as from time to time a song like this one, or Tupac's \"Unconditional Love\", comes along. \"Like Toy Soldiers\" is a song that I heard once, and felt compelled to come here to get the backstory on it. It tells a story, and a pretty fascinating one at that.\n\r\nAs for the people who say that they have a hard time buying Eminem's whole act when he himself instigated so many of his feuds, I can definitely see where you're coming from, but my personal take is that the man is simply growing up. He's at the right age to be doing it, and I bet a lot of his priorities are starting to shift.

The best part (tune and words) is the chorus which eminem had to sample from martika 'cos he can't write a whole album himself. I'm not labelling myself as anti-rap, or pro-rock, i liked the rap songs written by rhcp and of course nu-metal bands contain some rap, i just can't help noticing that of all types of music rap is the worst and it seems to be only listened to for the sake of it being rap, or else the melodies being so simple that people with no prior interest in music can 'get' them.\r\nAs open-minded as I try to be I can't shake the feeling that this is just a load of nonsense, that doesn't say anything interesting or new, and will be forgotten in a few years time.

Rap/hip-hop is based more on improvising with a good beat in the background.  Remember, though, that just because anyone can make a beat doesn't mean it's a good beat.  Eminem is a great producer, and an increadible story teller.  There may be more poetic artists out there, but Eminem is great at telling an intriguing story, as is proven by all these people posting on this forum.  Also, have you heard the covers of Jin and Juice(originally made by Snoop), and Boyz in the Hood?  They're both covers of rap songs by rock artists.

Ja went on to be signed by Suge Knight and 50 was signed by dre & Em to Shady-Aftermath. There are many refrences in both 50 & Ja's albums showing their hatred towards one another.

The guy on the table is Tupac. Its representing that because of beef in the 'rap game' somone has been killed. Tupac was very close to Eminem, not many people know that, Hense why Eminem is co-producer of Amaru Shakur Records alongside Tupacs mum Afeni. Eminem is pretty much explaining what happened between 50 and Ja and Eminem and how Dre's business is Dre's business with Suge. Hense the (?) 50 and Jar Rules beef come from the fact that 50 released his album the same time Ja did and it topped it. Def Jam records then tried to get Suge Knight to release his single on the album to try and boost sales but failed and never did so. 50 and Ja have had beef since. Eminem doesnt want beef between 50 and Ja, Hense the line \"We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin' \r\nMe and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him \r\nAnd asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him \r\nUntil Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him \r\nFuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it\" - Ja used to rap about muggin R&B stars and rappers etc. Which is one of the main reasons aswell why him and 50 never got on. Eminem made this song to try and end the beef in the rap game. At the end of the video you see \"Enough is Enough\" with Eminem sitting next to it on a news screen. He illustrates that he got in the game to do somethign he loved, rap. Not fight. Then at the end you see 4 rappers come up, Big L, Tupac, Biggie and the other dude but i forgot who. 4 Rappers who had lost there lives because of stupid beef because of rapping and how fame got to their heads. its an awesome song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_298": "\nShouldn't this title have a question mark?
