It all depends on your mood, I'm Dominican and have been listening to reggaetton since the old days when only underground stuff used to come out, nobody thought it was going to make this big a boom, and I myself was reluctant at first to accept the transition of the genre, but u know what... I really enjoy it, and it's not really the artists fault that the genre has reached such high levels of acceptance between communities, enjoy the music, dance to it. if you don't like it then don't waste your time posting here or hearing it! do yourselves a favor... :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\npitty post\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nBetter than that mexican regional and texmex crap you guys come up with lol\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nyankee is from Puerto Rico and so am I.. we dont really care about the lyrics or what it means as long as if its catchy and fun and sexy to dance with. i think people hate yankee because the media over-exposed him and also because they think he is a poser or a fake or whatever but we here know what he is all about and he is one of the greatest to us. and its a fashion so i know its not forever but as long as reggaeton is IN.. well, he will be remembered.\r\n and this song is not about sex...is about a guy saying to his exgirlfriend 'hey, we are through , face it . its over. you cheated and im not gonna take it etc\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nbooo dont bash on daddy yankee.

People only like this music because it's danceable, but ALL lyrics with no exception talk about sex. I mean, sex is cool, but... all songs like this one are substituted by another song, and that one by another and so on.

Reggae is for the Jamaicans, okay.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
