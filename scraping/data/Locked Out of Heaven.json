{"comment_0": "\nI dig the ode to The Police in this song... Bruno respects the history of pop music and his personal twist on it is refreshing...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nNot a Bruno fan (his voice is uninspiring), but this song has its merits. It's catcy and fitting. And It beats the boring yet popular Sex On Fire by Kings of Leon. For a very long, boring time I was viewed as a mother and a sister. It's won-der-ful being viewed as a woman and a passionate, energetic one. Here's to a new life and a sucky past that should have been buried a long, long time ago. Cheers to me!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThe lead single from singer-songwriter Bruno Mars' sophomore album, Unorthodox Jukebox, features production by Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, Emile Haynie and the songwriting/production team the Smeezingtons (Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine). The song finds Mars singing of a relationship that is so good the narrator feels like he was \"locked out of heaven\" before he met his lover. It debuted digitally and on radio on October 1, 2012 and became available for purchase the following day.\n\n\nDuring his Google+ Hangout on the day of the song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase \"But swimming in your water is something spiritual,\" and later said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the \"sensual, sensual and sensual\" theme of the album.\n\n\nThough critics have been quick to point out the song's similarities to some of the hits by the Police, Mars told MTV News he did not set out to write anything inspired by the Sting-fronted band. Instead, it came to him out of the blue, one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album. \"I don't think it initially tried to sound like anybody else, but I picked up the guitar and just started playing [the song's opening chords],\" Mars explained. \"That's how it normally works; I'll pick up a guitar and I'll start humming a melody, and I started singing that, and I was up there in Sting-ville, in that register, so that's what you get... I tend to listen to a lot of guys with higher registers - Sting being one of them, Freddie Mercury, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder - because I've got a high voice.\"\n\n\nThe song's stripped back music video was directed by Cameron Duddy, who also helmed the clip for Mars ' \"The Lazy Song.\" The retro visual mainly features the singer performing the track in a club, with a few added VHS effects. \"The concept is just old-fashioned fun. No story line, it's not me singing to a girl, you get a good sense of what you're going to get live,\" explained Mars to MTV News. \"It's very VHS-y. I love that man, it takes me back to my childhood, when the tracking is off and the color is off, there's a beauty in that. You'd have to stand by the TV with, like, aluminum foil all over you.\"\n\n\nBruno Mars performed the song live for the first time when he hosted and did double duty as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live, October 20, 2012.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nOkay guys this song is about me.

So good in fact that they feel they've been \"locked out of heaven\" (ecstasy, nirvana, Elysium etc.) because they haven't experienced it before.\n\nThe lyrics aren't as crass as many other songs out there, a little bit more subtle (although still quite unsubtle).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nI agree with bowtokingjesus this song is wank. It has little to no meaning and therefore is shit. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nThe song fucking sucks, the lyrics are an affront to anything holy, and the only thing catchy is the annoyance you'll be catching by the retarded \"bip bip bip bip HOO!\" part.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
