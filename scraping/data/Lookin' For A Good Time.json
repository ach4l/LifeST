It's about 2 people who like to be together for a good time to get away from it all but don't want the complications of a committed relationship.  Maybe a friends with benefits situation.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI don't usually listen to. Country music that much (my dad does though) but I LOVE THIS SONG!!! It's soo freakin catchy and I love it!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nUpon first listen it does in fact sound like a song about a casual one night stand, but the more I listen to it and read the lyrics it seems more to me like a song about not putting so much pressure on a relationship from the start like most of us do. If you read the bridge you can understand what i'm talking about. \"but you never say never in life\" seems like admitting it could happen but saying \"lets just not worry about that right now\".\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI think bammab90 hits the nail on the head. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
