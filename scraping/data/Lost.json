This song helped me through it; the words made me see there would be a light at the end of the tunnel - The light I'm beginning to see now.\n\r\nAbsolutely amazing song that's open to so much intepretation.\n\r\nI know people who believe it's about a loved one dying and how even though they're physically not there anymore, they'll always be with the person spiritually.\n\r\nAs I've said before; amazing song.\n\r\nWell done, Mr Bubl\u00e9.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nhis voice...it is..ohh...\r\nit is really something...that soothes someone's soul\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\n\r\nThe girl he loves was once happy, loved life. Life broke her heart, leaving her feeling sad, broken, lonely.
