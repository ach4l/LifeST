It reminded me of my 8th grade Christmas dance and no girl would dance with me. I was so depressed, but this song made me fell alot better.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nMariah's best song in my opinion. Wow. This song is just so incredible. I love EVERYTHING about it! I can relate to this song so much. I love the power and emotion in her voice. This will always be my all-time favourite song. You can really feel the 'hollow' in her heart. I know the feeling.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI always liked that this song came after \"Prisoner\" on the cd. It's kind of like after the drama of the break up dies down, and after she's gotten to think about things a bit, she thinks... Well maybe I was wrong...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nOnce upon a time there lived a sad young boy\r\nOne day he met a very beautiful girl who opened up to him\r\nAnd he opened up to her\r\nFor a while they saw each other every day\r\nBut somewhere along the line they stopped\r\nAnd he did nothing\r\nAnd she started visiting him again, every sunday\r\nBut one day she stopped again\r\nAnd he never thought she was seeing if he'd come to her\r\nHe just figured she no longer cared\n\r\nMaybe she didn't\n\r\nBut either way that boy is sorry now.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
