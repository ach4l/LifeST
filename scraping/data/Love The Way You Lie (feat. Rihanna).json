{"comment_0": "\nIt's about two people who meet and fall in love, however, as time goes on, they start to resent each other and the man becomes physically abusive. The woman takes it at first, but then she tries to leave him. He promises her that he'll never hurt her again and he'll try to control his temper, but he's lying. He says that if she ever tried to leave again, he'd kill her. The woman knows that this is all just a lie, but she keeps going back to him because she loves him.\n\r\nI think this song is especially powerful since Rihanna knows exactly what she is singing, due to her relationship with Chris Brown.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nNot only does Rihanna know what she's singing about here, but does no one remember Eminem and Kim? This is as much about them as it is Rihanna and Chris. Apt people for this song. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nGreat song, obviously about a both verbal and physically abusive relationship and how it seems the guy will say anything to keep his girl with him even though he's just spewing lies. Eminem is one of the few rappers I have strong respect for, he keeps it real. I adore the last set of verses the most, awesome lyrics and it makes the song even better with Rihanna singing the chorus considering her experience with abuse. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThere is domestic violence where the abuser who has no remorse and the victim, who at 1st thinks it is love but later realizes the other person is just abusive & really wants to leave the other but is afraid of what the other will do to them or their children if they do leave.. then there is the other.. \n\r\nand to me this is what Eminem is addressing, the dynamic of a relationship when 2 people have the most TOXIC LOVE imaginable for one another. They victimize the other person as well as themselves. They are both victims as well as guilty of being literally crazy for one another. I hope people dont have to experience this type of relationship but if you do I believe you go through it once. It's hard to truly understand unless you have been through it but the song as well as the video paints the picture of the turmoil that the extremity of emotions and how it is handled effect the people in these relationships. What they go through and what happens when they have no control of those emotions. You see what they are willing to endure for one another because no matter how bad it gets nothing seems worst then leaving each other. Their destructive relationship is a contradiction of what love should be but they truly are madly in love, Its heartbreaking...\n\n\r\n- \"And I love it the more that I suffer. I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me. She fucking hates me and I love it.\" \r\n- \"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's alright because I like the way it hurts\"\r\n- \"It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great... But when it's bad, it's awful. I feel so ashamed\"\r\n- \"You're the same as me. When it comes to love you're just as blinded. Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems, maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano. All I know is I love you too much to walk away though\"\n\r\nthose are the verses that really hit home when I hear this song. \r\nI have to say the hardest thing about being in that relationship was realizing that even though we wanted to to be together we needed to be apart. He showed me how much he loved me by leaving me. I knew it was killing him just as much as it was killing me.. Maybe years from now we can try again or maybe not but, one thing is for certain I dont ever doubt the depth of his love for me. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI think this song works on two different levels and perspectives.\n\r\nOne one hand, the song reads like a realtime story. It is unfolding with every verse Eminem sings. His lines are describing what's happening right now, and Rihanna recaps the theme of the song with her chorus. It's an abusive relationship that she is unable/unwilling to get out of. Their relationship is spiralling downwards, and at the end he makes a threat of what will happen if she leaves again.\r\nAnd we're left to wonder what DOES happen.\n\r\nBut if you look at it another way, we find out what happens. All of Eminem's verses are a flashback of the events leading up to that threat, which is the last thing that happens before the song starts. This is what's happening right now:\n\r\n\"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\r\nBut that's alright because I like the way it hurts\r\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\r\nBut that's alright because I love the way you lie\"\n\r\nHe is literally standing there, watching her burn and hearing her cry, and thinking about everything that happened leading up to this. Rihanna's lines become the present. \n\r\nListen to the song back to back. The first time picture Eminem's verses as the present. The second time, picture his verses as the past. And in between imagine that she tried to leave again and he acted out his threat. This perspective certainly makes the song a lot darker.\n\r\nNot sure if that makes sense to anyone, it looks a little confusing when I put it in writing...\n\n\n\n", "comment_5": "\nNot Eminems' best song, but it's okay.\n\r\nI think it's basically about a troubled relationship. Saying things you don't mean when you're mad, doing things you don't mean to because you're mad beacause it's in the heat of the moment. You love the person so much so you say whatever you can to make them come back, to make them stay. You say that it'll never happen again, but deep down you know it will but you just want to say whatever you can to prevent them from leaving. Then the cycle continues... \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI can't stop listening to this.

I think its about a disfunctional relationship, but they both live for it.  They have so much passion whether its with love or when they fight.  but they cant leave each other because they feed off it.  SO they just sit back and watch them destroy each other.

What makes it so great is the sheer rawness of emotion in both Eminems lyrics and Rihannas voice. What I find scary about this song is that I've been on both sides of a relationship similar to this and I think most people have. It's not as simple as walking away and leaving this shit behind and outsiders can never understand that, because deep inside is still that person, that spirit, that that soul that attracted you to them in the first place and you live in hope that soon the storm, the rage and the anger will pass and everything will be as it was in the beginning. \n\r\nLife isn't simple and neither are modern relationships. Violence is never cool in any form, but the video for this supports the theory that there is more at play that has possibly brought on the violence. Socio-Economic circumstance, booze, possibly drugs, petty crime, unemployment etc etc. \n\r\nI've always taken the line \"I love the way you lie\" more as a smartass comment to ones self about denying what is really going on here. Tricking yourself into believing that this is the person for you, that this behaviour is normal and that people will change, knowing full well that you shouldn't.\n\r\nI respect Rihanna so much more for doing this song, she copped so much criticism in Australia for this but NOT ONCE did the mainstream media who were slamming her sit down and actually listen to what this song is conveying.\n\r\nEvery word that comes out of Eminems mouth in this song sends chills up my spine. I've never related so much to a song in my life and when it's up loud this song just takes me away someplace else. \n\r\nFavourite lines \n\r\n- I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like.\r\n- Right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me\r\nShe fucking hates me and I love it, wait.\r\n- You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em, Got that warm fuzzy feeling, Yeah, them chills, used to get 'em, Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em\n\n\n\n", "comment_10": "\nThis song is absolutely incredible.

It is a viscous cycle of violence that often originated with trauma in childhood (but doesn't have to).  I counsel women who have been abused and they often will pick out men who will abuse them again.  There are many factors to it, but one major aspect is if they have not worked through and grieved the pain of the abuse they are destined to repeat it.  They have no respect for themselves, thus seek out the creeps who will confirm their low self concept.  Their tolerance for taking compliments is often amazingly low, where their tolerance for taking criticism is amazingly high.  I had one client save voicemails of her ex-boyfriend cussing her out and calling her names, whereas when she got a nice card from a friend she would quickly throw it away.     \n\r\nIf you are finding yourself in this cycle, I plead with you to find some help.  Someone who can gently lead you through what you are doing to yourself.  You are worth so much more, and there really is help.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nthis song has pure emotion. i think eminem rapping and rihanna singing in this song is the perfect combination.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\nits blatently about Eminem and Kim. Like the bit about: I snapped\r\nWho's that dude\r\nI don't even know his name\n\r\nDidnt Eminem get arrested a few years ago for beating up some guy talking to Kim? Also they were really on and off going their sepaerate ways etc. I love it because Eminem is being so raw and honest. The song doesn't just reflect relationships between lovers but the chorour really moved me because my mum used to physically abuse me and the Rihanna part reminded me of how she would see the pain she caused, and she hurt me alot but I still loved her and only recently could I properly break free. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\nThis song is about two people who fall in love but then it changes into an abusive relationship...both physically and emotionally. He does love her, enough he could hurt her. It's sick and twisted but things like this actually happen. She loves him back even though they both are hurting eachother. As much as it pains the woman, she tries to leave. He gets upset and says \"If she ever tries to fucking leave again\r\nI'mma tie her to the bed and set the house on fire\". What he means, is that if she ever tries to leave him again he will kill her. The sad part is, is that they both know he is lying when he says he's sorry and that it wont happen again. Each time I listen to this song it makes me cry. I give props for Rihanna for being able to sing this song after what happened between her and Chris Brown. Shady is also one of my favorite rappers for keeping things real. Good job to both of them and let us all realize how tragic abusive relationships really are.\n\n\n", "comment_16": "\nTo me it sounds like it begins at the end. \n\r\nHe says: \"If she ever tries to fucking leave again\r\nI'm a tie her to the bed and set the house on fire\" \n\r\nThe cycle almost always continues and she would \"try to leave\" again. \n\r\nIt just goes with the beginning of the chorus.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nOkay, Eminem introduces the song by saying:\n\r\na) \"I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like\"\n\r\nI think it's a 'gut' feeling Eminem is introducing here, of course this phrase will relate to subsequent lyrics.\n\r\nb) \"And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight\"\n\r\nThough indirect, it does relate to the first phrase. Not only is he suggesting a 'gut' feeling, but he is obviously inhibited in one way or another - anger would be the most probable scenario. He is foreshadowing the fact that he will not give up (no matter what).\n\r\nc) \"As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight\"\n\r\nAgain, further proving he will not give up - even if what he is doing is wrong, he forces himself to believe its right, and if he does that, he's fine with doing it.\n\r\nd) \"High off of love, drunk from her hate\"\n\r\nThere can be two different meanings to this phrase. If taken literally, this is an excuse as to why he abuses alcohol and drugs. However, it may not be about substances at all, he may be referring to his behavior. Perhaps she is the reason (or at least what he thinks is the reason) for his bad temper and his life problems. \n\r\ne) \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more that I suffer I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me she fucking hates me and I love it\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nOkay this part is fairly confusing, however, I think he purposely wrote it this way. The whole purpose of this phrase is to identify that it is a confusing relationship. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mentioning that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hurting emotionally, but right before he hits his low, she makes him feel great, and the sentence ends with a double negative. The whole sentence is: Hate, Love, Hate, Love, Hate, Love. \n\r\nf) \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait, where you going I'm leaving you No you ain't, come back We're running right back Here we go again It's so insane\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThis is an example of a pretty basic routine they have: She tries to leave, he says no. Push the repeat button.\n\r\ng) \u00e2\u0080\u009c'cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman with the wind in his back She's Lois Lane\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nWhen the relationship is going good, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perfect. He even relates to Superman and Lois Lane. I think he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pick any random \u00e2\u0080\u0098true love\u00e2\u0080\u0099 couple here. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just mention the couple, he also mentioned the \u00e2\u0080\u0098wind in his back\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (flying). This could suggest the fact that he has the power and/or control in the relationship.\n\r\nh) \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut when it's bad, it's awful I feel so ashamed I snapped Who's that dude I don't even know his name I laid hands on her I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThis part is important. Basically, he got angry at something she did (although he mentions another man, it could be more subtle. I think he just used this as a blind example). He says that he physically abused her while angry, told her he was sorry and he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it again. Also told her it was an accident saying \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know my own strength\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\n\n\n", "comment_18": "\npeople are saying this song is so moving because Rihanna knows from experience what she's singing about, and i agree it IS very emotional but honestly it's so upsetting i instantly have to change the radio whenever it comes on.  what kind of message is this sending to women?? that it's noble and beautiful to stand there and burn and enjoy the pain??  i'm so angry at everyone involved in producing this song. the female voice in the song never gets angry or condemns the violent male, and this is simply an unacceptable message to send to victims of domestic violence, no matter how true to life it is.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_19": "\nMen who abuse are sick people, they seriously need therapy.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_20": "\ni think that this song is about a girl who loves this guy a lot, but the guy doesn't realy love her back and hurts/treats her realy bad, but she loves him enough to love his bad parts \"... but it's alright because i love the way you lie\" and tries to stay with him through all that he puts her trough because she loves him so much. but when he snaps her hurts her and she  can't take it and she snaps back, that makes him mad and he hurts her \"... i laid hands on her\" but in the end they love each other\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_21": "\nDamn genius.

In the video you witness them both hitting and being physical with each other, both are caught talking to other people, and yet both are shown to be completely enamored for each other.\n\r\nWe have all been there right?  When the person you love does something to hurt you very bad and all you want to do is hurt them back as retribution.  Yet in all of this effort, you are focusing all of your energy on this one person and they occupy 100% of your thought process.  One could say this is a testament in and of itself for the love you have for them.  At some point you make up though and the complete rush that comes with this over takes you both with the power of a drug.  But as all highs go, it wears off and the cycle repeats.

My sixteen year old son (who is a rapper) has ironically asked me to sing the female part of this song. When I sing it I can feel it deep in my soul. \n\r\nI believe when the lyrics say \"I like\" and \"I love\" the way you lie...it is a mocking comment.  No woman, man or child likes or loves to be abused.  But most of the time the abuser is trapped into thinking or believing that she/he desires it.  We believe that it is our fault, that we are not able to stand without a partner, that nobody will love us again if we leave. Maybe we don't have a place to go so we stay with the abuser.  There are so many lies that I told myself when I was on the abusive cycle.  It is very hard to get off and I truly have a heart and much compassion for those who fall victim to this tragedy.  I also believe the victim has issues from the past.  Maybe there was abuse in the home and the victim has learned this behavior from childhood.\n\r\nWhat ever the reasons, what ever the case... there is NO excuse for abuse.  We can and we must have healthy boundaries and say NO to violence of any kind. IT is simply NOT ACCEPTABLE. It causes so much pain, trauma and sometimes even death to the victim.  It is a sometimes silent killer especially if the abuse is mental, emotional or spiritual.  It is silent because there are oftentimes no bruises and the victim appears to be alright...But he/she suffers silently.  \n\r\nPLEASE if you know or suspect a loved one or a friend that is going through this....HELP THEM!! Offer a place for them to stay and get involved.  Do not let someone you know or love suffer needlessly and helplessly.\n\r\nGod Bless and peace to all of you...love yourselves, you are worth it \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_26": "\nChris Brown's undefeated!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_27": "\nThe music video definitely shows what the song is about, too many people listen to this song and say it's just the guy being abuse. That is just wrong. Both parties are at fault, their love brings them together but their mistrust/jealousy pushes them apart. I've also noticed that no one has fully described the meaning to the song so I will do so below.\n\r\nI can't tell you what it really is\r\nI can only tell you what it feels like\r\n(Eminem is describing the relationship. He can't describe how the relationship really is because the love/hate aspect would make anyone think that they're both crazy, but if he describes how they can love each other so passionately and yet intensely hate each other at the same time maybe people will understand the relationship better)\r\nAnd right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe\r\nI can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight\r\nAs long as the wrong feels right\r\nIt's like I'm in flight\r\n(This is right after they have an argument. He feels horrible about what he said and did to her but part of him gets a rush out of the fights they have and as long as he still gets the rush he knows it's still going to happen.)\r\nHigh off of love, drunk from her hate\r\nIt's like I'm huffing paint\r\nAnd I love it the more that I suffer\r\nI suffocate\r\nAnd right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me\r\nShe fucking hates me and I love it\r\n(Again, he loves and hates her at the same time, the first line says that it's mutual though and she loves/hates him right back and he loves it. She starts the arguments too but right before he decides to  leave her she knows just what to do to bring the relationship back but still shows that she hates him at the same time.)\r\nWait, where you going\r\nI'm leaving you\r\nNo you ain't, come back\r\n(Obviously a conversation between the two. I get the feeling that the lines really could alternate either way with either the guy having the first line or the girl. It could be the guy from the previous phrase getting ready to leave the girl, or it could be the girl deciding to leave the guy. either way it's happened before and will happen again.)\r\nWe're running right back\r\nHere we go again\r\nIt's so insane\r\n'cause when it's going good, it's going great\r\nI'm Superman with the wind in his back\r\nShe's Lois Lane\r\nBut when it's bad, it's awful\r\n(This is the proof that the previous lines have happened before \"Here we go again\", but before that it also says that they're going to get back together again. He tries to describe again just how the relationship is, when it's good it's amazing, it could never be better. I like how he understates how it is when it's bad, but he does it to prove a point. The point is that they love each other more than they hate each other and that's why they keep running back to each other despite the constant fights.)\r\nI feel so ashamed\r\nI snapped\r\nWho's that dude\r\nI don't even know his name\r\nI laid hands on her\r\nI'll never stoop so low again\r\nI guess I don't know my own strength\r\n(Pretty self-explanatory IMHO, She was talking to another guy and he got jealous and snapped. I feel that the fact he didn't know the other guy's name is irrelevant, he probably would've snapped anyway. The point here is that it's not just his fault. She was almost egging him on because she knew just how jealous he was but was with that other guy anyway.)\n\r\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\r\nBut that's alright because I like the way it hurts\r\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\r\nBut that's alright because I love the way you lie\r\nI love the way you lie\r\nI love the way you lie\r\n(This describes the love hate relationship they have and how no matter what he does she'll always come right back to him. She's in love with the pain both physical and emotional because of the intensity and rush of emotions that come with it. When she says she loves the way he lies it means that she loves the way he lies to her about how he'll change and it will never happen again even though she knows better and they'll continue to fight)\n\r\nYou ever love somebody so much\r\nYou can barely breathe when you're with 'em\r\nYou meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em\r\nGot that warm fuzzy feeling\r\nYeah, them chills, used to get 'em\r\nNow you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em\r\n(I think we've all been here at some point. You meet somebody and it's complete head over heels love at first sight. You don't eat, sleep, or anything else much anymore. All you want is to be with that other person. When you think of them you're instantly warm and happy, and you get chills looking at them and realizing how perfect that they are (at least in your own eyes). Then all of a sudden, one day after seeing them forever it's like a wake up call. You suddenly see all of their little imperfections and it makes you almost physically sick. You feel like you never want to see them again, you get angry at them with the hopes that they will leave you alone.)\r\nYou swore you've never hit 'em\r\nNever do nothing to hurt 'em\r\nNow you're in each other's face\r\nSpewing venom in your words when you spit 'em\r\n(In the beginning of a relationship you swear you'll treat them like a king/queen, never do anything to hurt them either physically or emotionally. Later on though after things change like above, you start to argue, it starts off small then it gets bigger and bigger.)\r\nYou push, pull each other's hair\r\nScratch, claw, bit 'em\r\nThrow 'em down, pin 'em\r\nSo lost in the moments when you're in 'em\r\nIt's the rage that took over\r\nIt controls you both\r\nSo they say it best to go your separate ways\r\nGuess that they don't know ya\r\n'cause today, that was yesterday\r\nYesterday is over\r\nIt's a different day\r\n(The first half describes the fights that they have. It started off verbally above but after a while they built up a tolerance to the verbal fights so it had to get bigger, they started fighting physically. Notice again that Eminem doesn't blame one side or the other, he says that they're both to blame for the fighting because of the emotional rush that they both get from the fights. When they're in either they're good or their bad moments it's like they never want it to end because of the emotional rush both the good and the bad gives them. Again, he says that the rage isn't just him or just her, it's them both. It controls both them and the relationship. The fighting is actually what they have in common, they both need it and it's what keeps them together. They're friends tell them that they're crazy for acting how they do and they need to break up. They both agree that they're friends don't know what they're talking about and don't know them well enough. He lies and promises it won't happen again and that's why they say that today is different than yesterday, even though they both know it's not and they're destined to fight again.)\n\r\nSound like broken records playin' over\r\nBut you promised her next time you'll show restraint\r\nYou don't get another chance\r\nLife is no Nintendo game\r\nBut you lied again\r\nNow you get to watch her leave out the window\r\nGuess that's why they call it window pane\r\n(Eminem breaks the forth wall here and talks directly to the listener that's in a normal relationship. In a normal relationship couples often break up after large fights. Eminem tells the listener not to be like the couple in the song and to learn to control themselves because \"life is no nintendo game\", if a person messes up big odds are that they deserve to be broken up with. I love the play on words he uses at the end with window pane (pain).)\n\r\nNow I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean\r\nAnd we fall back into the same patterns, same routine\r\nBut your temper's just as bad as mine is\r\nYou're the same as me\r\nWhen it comes to love you're just as blinded\r\nBaby, please come back\r\nIt wasn't you, baby it was me\r\nMaybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems\r\nMaybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano\r\nAll I know is I love you too much to walk away though\r\nCome inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk\r\nDon't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk\r\nTold you this is my fault\r\nLook me in the eyeball\r\nNext time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall\n\r\n(I look at this as the guy talking to the girl. The guy says he knows that they didn't really mean what they said when they fought but he also admits that the fighting has now become routine for them. They both expect and accept it. He tries to appeal to her by making her realize that they're the exact same. They both have really bad tempers and so they fight constantly, however neither one of them can see it because of how \"love is blind\" and they love each other to the fine line of love and hate. He begs her to come back. Once again appeals to how their relationship isn't crazy, it's just how it is because of how they both are and they both love to hate each other. The fact that he uses a tornado and a volcano, two very destructive forces again shows how it's not just one or the other's fault, they both are too jealous, controlling, loving, all at the same time. He takes the blame for this fight though because he knows it will make her come back. He says next time he'll take his anger out on the wall instead of her.)\n\r\nNext time, there won't be no next time\r\n(I see this as the girls reply, she's starting another fight here. She knows that saying no will make him angry again and start another fight, she knows it's going to happen, but she hates and loves it at the same time.\r\nI apologize even though I know it's lies\r\n(His reply to hers to once again try to get her back. He apologizes for his temper but he knows it's a lie and that they will eventually fight again.)\r\nI'm tired of the games\r\nI just want her back\r\nI know I'm a liar\r\nIf she ever tries to fucking leave again\r\nI'mma tie her to the bed and set the house on fire\r\n(this ending is him talking to himself. He's personally starting to get tired of the fights because he knows that they push her away from him. He knows he's lying to himself though and that he knows that he'll start another fight. His jealousy/controlling temper decides that he won't let her leave and he decides what he'll do if she ever actually does leave. I think though that according to the music video that the next time that she tries to leave he does get mad and sets the house on fire, but they both survive as they can be seen outside of the burning building at the end. The fact that they're both on fire is not literal, it's the burning of their relationship, how they both love each other but the fighting is destroying them both. I also think they survive as i believe that they're both kissing in front of the burning house at the end, showing that even though he took such drastic measures, they're both still very much in love.)\r\nthis ends my analysis for part 1.

Domestic violence plagues our culture, and this song unabashedly expresses this conflict in a unique way. They use the medium to make you almost FEEL your in the relationship. There's been songs about domestic violence before, but none that makes you experience the temptations so strongly through the music. It's a melody made to make us want to feel romance and emotion, and yet the words are so brash. Very powerful. It's a daring song that doesn't solely victimize either person, nor create a villain out of either person. They are two people incredibly attached to each other who also happen to be in an incredibly toxic relationship. The woman just can't get herself to leave the man because she admits to herself this is what she wants, and the man can't handle the intense emotions he has for the woman. Very strong reflection of those involved in domestic violence. I am sure Rhianna had a stronger understanding, due to her unfortunate experiences.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_33": "\ni used to really hate this song, because i felt it was condoning abusive relationships, and i felt the woman was idiot for staying and saying that she loved it and him, and the whole relationship in general. that is until recently..... i'am literally living this relationship as i type this, i agree with most people, very raw and alot of emotion in this song that pretty much sums it up. every word in this lyric is how my ex-boyfriend (i guess that is what we are at the moment) and i feel. we both want to stop hurting each other, but it seems like we really need each other and the cycle continues. We both believe that one day it will get better, but im starting to think it never does...... reality will hit one day, and i'am afraid of what will happen to me or him..... its very hard to break from a relationship like this but its doable, this is the millionth time we try to break up, after a huge fight like this, but we shall see how it goes in the next couple of days... either way this song has new meaning and i see it very different from what i used to think of it. and Its a sad unfortunate situation but very really and difficult to give up.... and some people dont understand and cant understand, but theres a lot including myself that do and can relate to the lyrics of this song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_34": "\nI'm not really a fan of either artist (I do respect Eminem though, he's a talented guy) but I do like this song. It does what a lot of songs about domestic abuse do not, which is show the abuse in this relationship comes from both sides. Neither person in this situation can call themselves the victim, because they've both played a hand in what has happened between them. Usually, a song addressing this topic paints one particular person as the abuser, so it's nice to see someone take this in a different direction. Also, I don't think this song is justifying abuse as much as it's giving the listener some insight into what the singers relationship is like. It's painful, volatile, addicting, and destructive during the bad times, but passionate, loving, and supportive when things are good. Basically it's like a roller coaster. The assent it fun an exciting, but the drop is terrifying. Don't take this the wrong way though, these relationships are unhealthy and the people in them should part their ways as soon as they can to prevent any further (and sometimes irreversible) damage. It's an all around good song, and it's part 2 is not far behind... although I think Eminem's verse is the best part of that particular song.

When they are going good, there great- and alot of times we try and hold on to those moments. and when there bad- they are horrible. Especially in the songs situation. The boyfriend becomes abusive and hits the girl, and then feels terrible after and promises never to do it again. The girl is probably just as crazy mentally at times because of all the emotions that run through their heads when they fight- they are both not thinking clearly. Alot of girls beleive this and stay with the guy because they because they love him so much. The guy in the song knows if he gets angry again he will most likely hit her but he promises lies about not ever touching her again. When i hread the ending of the song, at first i was like what a terrible ending- he basically says hes going to kill her if she ever tried to leave him. But then i thought, that completely fits. Its basically saying, when in an abusive realtionship you need to get out, because if a man can hit you, then he is capable of doing worse things as well.

She will keep believing his lies because she loves him too much and the torment from the lies is what she thrives on... By him lying it shows her that he loves her enough to try and keep her around with all his lies and she takes it. He convinces himself that he will change, but it is true that the routine will keep returning unless she leaves him, but she will always go back because she loves him so much, so she learns to love his faults. These kind of guys will say whatever they can to keep you, but just remember they will watch you cry and let you burn in flames to get what they want out of you.... whatever it my be...

Usually if a man hits a woman, the song is all about what a sick man he is, how dare you hit a woman, etc. And it is VERY wrong. But there is something just as sick and distrubing about a woman who stays in a relationship like that. I'm NOT saying she deserves it, I'm just saying that the woman is as screwed up as he is in the head, and I'm glad this song seems to acknowledge it, when most of the time the victim's emotional instabily is glossed over or overlooked completely.\n\r\nLeave it to Eminem to speak the truth. :D I also love the ending. How he admits he's lying, he know he won't change. He's lying and he thinks he might kill her if she tries to leave him again. I love how the end of the song he talks about how he'll \"set this place on fire\" and then suddenly Rihanna's lyrics that have been symbolic (burn meaning hurt) becomes literal, as in kind of hinting that he's so sick he would watch her burn if she did leave him. The song goes from sad to kinda morbid and shocking at the end- very much Eminiem's style. I love it.\n\r\nI think it's interesting Rihanna did this song based on her own life experience of being an abuse victim. Good for her to face what happened and not be afraid to use it in her songs.

So after a while the wife tries to leave the abusive relationship . And when she does he threatens to kill her if she ever tries to again , so in her mind she has to tell herself that the pain is not that bad . She tells herself she likes it because she has no other choice but to like it . She can't leave so she has to endure what he does to her , no matter how painful it is . She tells herself its not as bad as it seems . She constantly lies to herself .

Then i started changing who i was as a person. Would always make sure when he got off work everything was cleaned.. starting buying food he likes. he wouldnt let my call me parents or family.. i was living 12 hours away from where my family lives..so i get  fed up leave him numerous times. but like the song she keeps going back because u love em.. not for what or who they are.. you love them for the potential u see in them as a person.. i seen only the guy i met. i didnt see this monster who threw fits of rage..then the rages started getting worse.. he start out with pintching me and biting me.. then as the arguments got worse and more consistent. he started hitting me.. but not in places where people could see but where i knew they were.. i was a young gurl trapped with a mind game playing adult man. he knew how to control me and say all the right things.. told me he wouldnt do it ne more. used tears too the fullest.. telling me he would kill himself if i would leave him.. I heard all these different promises and lies from him.. then i started fighting back it got worse.. like how eminem says Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems\r\nMaybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano. this is how i was starting too feel and think.. but i so know the chorus of rihannas lyrics.\r\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\r\nBut that's alright because I like the way it hurts\r\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\r\nBut that's alright because I love the way you lie\r\nI love the way you lie\r\nI love the way you lie\r\nbecausee thats what i went through until i got up the nerve and left him started telling my self i deserved better and that this wasnt normail. and i missed the old me. know that i will never be the same  mentally but atleast i learned and can help other women with this experience.i went through 6 years of pain! but i thank god for my life. worse could have been done.. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_82": "\nThis song is a story about two people who are deeply in love.

There is this beautiful delusion that everything has changed, that such deeply ingrained behavior patterns will just disappear if both parties try hard enough.

My parents have a relationship somewhat like this. They've been giving one another hell for nearly thirty years, and I've done my best to avoid this sort of relationship. They cooled down a bit with age, no one's died.

[Only those you allow to come close enough to actually hurt you can garner real hatred.] In my opinion, its about how some people [a lot of people more than likely], himself included, get caught in the \"love-hate\" relationship; and it rarely ends well.

Rihanna has copped some criticism, especially because of the well-known history of domestic abuse, however it was exceptionally brave and  artistically creative for Rihanna to contribute to this song and the power which it demonstrates between the two artists from the turmoil and love-driven angst of Eminems rap which divulges into the deepest psyche of his part of the relationship (that he woulld rather literally burn everything, including her, than give it all up) which goes into great detail, then switches to Rihannas complementary simple and melodic chorus in which she confesses that she understands her situation in the relationship ('Just gonna stand there and watch me burn/ Well thats alright because I like the way it hurts) and the danger of this, but loves him and will stay with him anyway.\n\r\nThis is my own personal interpretation of the song, which can also be interpretted as a story of violent domestic abuse or modern-age love, leave comments if you want to lave your own opinion :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_101": "\nI don't know if this song is really about Marshal and Kim anymore than his other songs depict what he does, however, he describes so well why many people stay in abusive relationships. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the pain inflicted by the abuser that the victim loves, but the affection they receive after a violent outburst. The victim believes the promises that \"it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen again\" and believe the may harm themselves if the victim leaves. It is textbook that the victim senses the abuser's irritability rising before they go into a violent rage. The victim may do or say something to trigger the rage to \u00e2\u0080\u009cget it over with\u00e2\u0080\u009d so that they can return to the making up phase, also called the \u00e2\u0080\u009choneymoon phase\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Eventually the honeymoon phase becomes shorter until non-existent as the abuser has more control over the victim, and the abuse becomes more lengthy and lethal. The promises to stop and threats to harm themselves become threats to harm or kill the victim if they leave, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have you, no one will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so the saying goes.\n\r\nIf you are experiencing any of this in your current relationship, get help and get out!

So he feels ashamed but he covers it up again with anger, just like the first few lines, and takes it out on her.\n\r\nWho's that dude\r\nI don't even know his name\r\nI laid hands on her\r\nI'll never stoop so low again\r\nI guess I don't know my own strength\n\r\n- These are probably the things he says to her all the time, his \"apologies\" to her, and how he'll never hit her again though he KNOWS he will.\n\n\r\n(verse2)You ever love somebody so much\r\nYou can barely breathe when you're with 'em\r\nYou meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em\r\nGot that warm fuzzy feeling\r\nYeah, them chills, used to get 'em\r\nNow you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em\n\r\n- He loved her a lot at first but then something went wrong. He still remembers how great their relationship was at first.\n\r\nYou swore you've never hit 'em\r\nNever do nothing to hurt 'em\r\nNow you're in each other's face\r\nSpewing venom in your words when you spit 'em\r\nYou push, pull each other's hair\r\nScratch, claw, bit 'em\r\nThrow 'em down, pin 'em\n\r\n- He remembers how he said he'd never hurt her.\n\r\nSo lost in the moments when you're in 'em\r\nIt's the rage that took over\r\nIt controls you both\r\nSo they say it best to go your separate ways\r\nGuess that they don't know ya\r\n'cause today, that was yesterday\r\nYesterday is over\r\nIt's a different day\n\r\n- People (friends, therapists, ect) tell the girl often to leave this man, and tell the man to stop what he is doing. But he just says that the next day will be different and he doesn't see a reason for their relationship to end.\n\r\nSound like broken records playin' over\r\nBut you promised her next time you'll show restraint\r\nYou don't get another chance\r\nLife is no Nintendo game\r\nBut you lied again\n\r\n- He keeps telling her that he'll stop but he never does, and he's running out of chances.\n\r\nNow you get to watch her leave out the window\r\nGuess that's why they call it window pane\n\r\n- She leaves sometimes. He doesn't like watching her go.\n\n\r\nNow I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean\r\nAnd we fall back into the same patterns, same routine\r\nBut your temper's just as bad as mine is\r\nYou're the same as me\n\r\n- He blames her in part for everything, saying \"she's just like him\" and that he shouldn't be so much at fault for the state between them. She comes back all the time and they keep fighting even though they both try to stop.\n\r\nWhen it comes to love you're just as blinded\n\r\n- Acting really creepy now, he thinks that the reason they don't get along is because of \"love\".\n\r\nBaby, please come back\r\nIt wasn't you, baby it was me\r\nMaybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems\r\nMaybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano\n\r\n- She's left him and he wants her back, so he throws more excuses at her, again blaming her for everything.\n\r\nAll I know is I love you too much to walk away though\r\nCome inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk\r\nDon't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk\r\nTold you this is my fault\r\nLook me in the eyeball\r\nNext time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall\n\r\n- More excuses from him as he tries to get her to come back, and this time takes the blame, showing how desperate he is. He tells her that he'll never hit her again.\n\r\nNext time, there won't be no next time\r\nI apologize even though I know it's lies\r\nI'm tired of the games\r\nI just want her back\r\nI know I'm a liar\r\nIf she ever tries to fucking leave again\r\nI'mma tie her to the bed and set the house on fire\n\r\n- She goes back to him, and the first line is probably her talking, telling him that he should never be so pissed at her to hit something. The next lines as well, her saying she's \"sorry\" but when really she knows that it's all his fault, so defeated, she comes back to him. In the next lines he admits that he's lying and he'll keep manipulating her, and he realizes what he does to her but he enjoys it too much for her to leave him.\n\n\n\n", "comment_111": "\nThis song i believe is trying to saw the two sides of a same coin.

Very catchy track. Eminem, as usual, has the voice backed by raw emotion and his excellent timing. The song is obviously about a dysfunctional relationship.

He gives the typical \"I won't do it again\" sad song all the while he knows he will because he cannot control his rage. The \"I love the way you lie\" is her knowing the truth... he will feel fear again and explode. She will be his punching bag again and again. She loves him (although he will never fully believe that due to his own personal demons), and she doesn't see a way out. And her looking for that way out is always in the back of his mind. It plays into his insecurities which fuel his rage.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_131": "\n When my mother left my father, he started stalking her and ended up killing my younger sister and himself. This song came out not too long after her death. For me this song is clearly about an abusive relationship, the lyrics remind me of my father and how he was towards everyone in the family. It is truly creepy because some of the lyrics are strikingly similar to things I heard my father say throughout my life.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_132": "\n\"Not the best video for my 6 year old to watch\" , \"exposing her to that type of violence\" . Well ,kiss my ass and take the mother of the year award back because I sit with her and watch it 5 times in a row. She says, \" I love this song and I hate this song \". \r\n The woman in this video is just as abusive as the man. Sure he puts a hole in the wall and burns down the house but she hits him, spit on him, played her \"get him jealous\" games.\r\n Toying with a man like that is just as hurtful as a slap across the face.\" Hearts are delicate and love is powerful, so play nice and always play fair \" Is what I explained to my little one.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_133": "\nI used to be in the exact same relationship until he fell in love with someone else.

It's that the victim ends up in the hospital or worse.\n\nIn a sea of rap music that glamorizes violence and treating women like ****, I wanted to come here and give Eminem credit for telling the truth.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_138": "\nIndeed, the song is pretty clear.  Its about a toxic relationship where the man beats his woman.  And she suffers, and in his own way of course, he suffers.  But she stays, or come back.  And he loves her truly in his own way.\n\nYes, this happens a lot in our society. \n\nMan can abuse his woman  and also woman can abuse her man.\n\nThis is not just a one way fact of life. \n\nIts not alright.  \n\nIts not ok.  \n\nIndeed, it is not tolerable.\n\nIn a perfect societey it does not exist.\n\nBut its here.  \n\nMany others are hurt most of the time.  The kids.  The close families.  The friends.\n\nWhy? \n\nHow?\n\nIndeed these are questions most of us can't comprehend.  \n\nOh, we can understand the hate, the anger, the frustrations sometimes... but most of us are able to control ourselves.\n\nWhat is most hard to comprehend, though, is why the violated ones remains with the violators, yes?\n\nIs it even comprehensible?\n\nSometimes I guess it is.  \n\nIs there a lesson here?  Is it karma?  Is it something else?  Is the man truly evil?  Is the woman truly evil? \n\nWhat can we do?\n\nFight?\n\nFight against what?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_139": "\nEminem really nails the emotions surrounding violent relationships in a way that I've never heard in a song before. I've lived this type of relationship personally and it's frightening how close his lyrics sound to my husband's reasoning. When I left after he shoved me through a wall, this song came out. He listened to it a lot while we were separated. I've also acted violently mostly in self defense. Also, when you're abused, you often end up with a huge well of anger inside of you. I was never a violent person until he started hitting me. Never. \nHere's my take: both people in a relationship like this are acting out their dysfunctional childhoods on each other. Love means pain, control, dysfunction. They find someone who shares compatible demons and it's off to the races. \nIf you're in this type of relationship, take a step back and realize that this can't be healthy or good. If you truly love your partner, you'll leave them before you both destroy each other. Sometimes the kindest thing is to leave.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_140": "\nThis song is sad and yet very good, But why would you want to burn someone you love?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_141": "\nTERRIFIC SONG!!!!
