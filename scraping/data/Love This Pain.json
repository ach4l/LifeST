{"comment_0": "\nThis is one of my favorite songs from Lady A.\r\nIt's about a man or woman who you KNOW you shouldn't be with or like, but you can't help it. The words speak for themselves - \r\nIt's like I love this pain \r\na little too much \r\nlove my heart all busted up \r\nsomethin bout her \r\nit just don't work \r\nbut I can't walk away \r\nit's like I love this pain \n\r\nI couldn't explain how I feel about my current situation any better than how this song says!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nthis song is one of my favorite from lady antebellum. i believe it's about a man who is so in love with a woman who is no good for him. they've tried to make the relationship work over and over again because neither wants to say that it's just not going to work. they would rather keep hurting each other than say goodbye. i've been in the situation and this song brings me back to it every time, which is the beauty of this song. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nLove hate relationship. You love to hate them and hate to love them. This is how I see this song. He loves her but also hates her and all the fights that happen. I have been in a love hate relationship, we balanced each other perfectly and we loved to hate each other and hated to love each other. Some people don't like relationships like that but I love them. Keeps everything interesting and fun. All the ups and downs kept us going. That's what the song is saying\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
