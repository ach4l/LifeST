The relationship she has with him was not going anywhere and it was best to call it quits, she knows that, but she still holds on.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis is the saddest, sweetest song ever. Miranda is an amazing singer and songwriter. This is my favorite song on her album by a MILE! I'm surprised no one's commented on it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI like this song.... this hasnt happened to me,,,but sometimes i dont want to see him but I still love him.... i just want him to be near me... like my friend. whatever! This song is great\n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis song really is amazing, and fits me perfectly. The way I see it is she is saying she knows the relationship could never work, and she really doesn't want to be together anymore, though she is still in love with him. All she wants is to remember the good times and all the good memories they have made, but she doesn't want to get back together because she realized they just won't work. Therefore, she doesn't want to feel him, see him, look into his eyes, or anything else physically speaking. She simply just wants to reflect on the good aspects of the relationship. That's just my interpretation and how I like to think of it. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
