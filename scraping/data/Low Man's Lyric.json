It combats the popular religious belief that you can be forgiven by confessing your sins. You can apologize to others for who you are, but that's not the same as forgiving yourself. You'll always be tied to what you've done and at the end of the day if you feel like you're not a good person, then the only resolution is to attempt to change your nature. Yet, you're trapped forever in your own mind with the memories of what you've done in your life. If you have corrupted and harmed other human beings, then it's difficult to feel like you really deserve forgiveness. If you can't look at yourself and say that you've lived your life the right way or treated people well, then how will you ever feel like you're deserving of the good that life has to offer?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThere is definately alot of feeling in this song.

The trash fire is the little bit of hope that this person offered him, but the storm is the inevitability that he will kill himself, as he knows that the net has rotted away, but still chooses to give up and let go of his life. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a suicide note because it says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done and to do\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which means by the time he/she reads the note, he will be dead, but it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet happened. And as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing, he is feeling like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already dead (being so low the sky is all he can see, like in a grave), which is why he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s figuratively feeling for a pulse and is so far gone in his depression, that he sees nothing but that looming cloud of death in the distance. He also sees himself as this worthless person who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve to live. He tried to feel better about himself, but it was only on an outward notion, as it says that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lying to himself. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s asking forgiveness because even though he may not feel like he deserves it, the person will be hurt that he killed himself. The note he is writing is to give some kind of clarity as to why he is killing himself, so the person he is writing it to will understand. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sorry because this person has already saved him from committing suicide before, but he just wants to put himself out of his misery and save the world from himself. When he says that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s touching the clean to the waste, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually him who is the waste and is comparing the person who saved him as clean and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tainted the person with the burden of trying to save this man.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nOne of the deepest songs Het has ever written. It's a bit long of a description but please give me a chance to explain and I promise, if you love this song as well, you will feel very inspired. \n\r\nThis song is about addiction. Plain and simple. It's a letter being written to a loved one from a moment of clarity or a time when sober, such as being in rehab. If you read EVERYTHING together, not just \"my fingers seek my veins\", you'll see it. I'll just use \"her\" for simplicity's sake to refer to the person he cares for since it's Hetfield speaking to this person... \n\r\nThe first verse is stating his intentions. His heart wants sobriety/reality, but his body keeps going back to the drug. He wants another chance with her, wanting to come back to his life/out of the \"rain\". \n\r\nSecond verse, he \"fell\"/relapsed because he \"gave up\" and his chances had been used up/net below has rot away. \n\r\nChorus.. He's lost everything so he's \"keeping warm with the trash fire\" but he still craves/nowhere safe from the \"storm\" of addiction in his mind. And he can't bear to acknowledge/look at what he's become. \n\r\nHe's literally writing to her (again, most likely from rehab or place of sobriety), coming to terms with what he's done and the path he must take to sobriety, and asking her not to feel pity since he accepts he's made these decisions, but instead asking for forgiveness.\n\r\nThird... with sobriety, comes a feeling of being extremely \"low\" and depressed with what you've done, and craving forgiveness from those you've hurt. (And possibly the most important line of the song) \"you bring this poor dog in from the rain/and he just wants right back out again\"... the endless cycle of addiction, you beg for help, receive it, but just end up relapsing/into addiction, wanting to or involuntarily.\n\r\nAt a time when he lost everything, he would \"cry to the alleyway/confess all to the rain\" because addiction stripped him of a home and everyone he cared about... no one left to listen, nowhere left to live. And as every addict does, he \"lies straight to the mirror\" (we lie to ourselves about everything... being in control, still having a life, \"going to quit tomorrow\"); the one he's \"broken to match his face\" (hating what he sees when he looks at himself because deep down he knows the truth).\r\n**********\r\nI see many differing opinions of this brilliant song and Metallica songs have always been open to the listener's interpretation. But one thing I've noticed about Hetfield's songs about addiction, many of them are very difficult to pinpoint as being ABOUT addiction until you yourself have fallen into the abyss of addiction. There were a good 5 or 6 songs (Sad But True, House Jack Built, Bleeding Me, Trapped Under Ice, etc) I never had any idea dealt with this until you start coming face to face with everything he's saying. That's the sign of a true artist.. once you live thru it, you feel what he's saying.\n\r\nThank you if you've stuck with me to the end here, and I hope this helped bring the feeling and depth of this work of art into your heart and soul. And for those of you that suffer addiction like me, I hope this song brings solace and a tiny bit of serenity into your life as so many of James Hetfield's songs have done for me. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nI interpret this song to be about a homeless man who once had a family, but drugs messed up his life and now he's out on the streets. \n\r\nHe just wants his family to forgive him and no matter how they try to help him, he keeps ending up back \"out in the rain\", and on the street.\n\r\nThe trash fire symbolizes the place where he feels safest.

Especially Low Man's Lyric (not Lyrics) and Mama Said.  I think it has a much deeper meaning than what has been mentioned here.  Also, a lot of what James has written has been put on paper merely because it sounds good with the song.  Watch the documentary \"Some Kind Of Monster,\" and you'll see what I mean.\n\r\nBut I definitely agree that it is about someone seeking forgiveness from someone.  Who?  Who knows.  Why?  Who knows.  Ignoring much of the benign first paragraph resembling lyrics from a hobo, the lyrics \"And I can't bare to see, What I've let me be\" define the rest of the song.  Whoever he wrote about, a definite \"something\" is missing from a life they would envision as being better.\n\r\nI will be perfectly honest, much of the song remains a mystery to me.  I think a lot of what he wrote into this song was written purely because it conveyed a sense of unhappiness and darkness to define the song.

There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only one other review(Yisroel) that agrees plain and simple its about a homeless guy struggling with heroin addiction.\r\n\"My eyes seek reality, My fingers seek my veins\"\r\n-Some people think that people use drugs to escape reality, which is pretty much true, so this guy sees that his own reality is that of a drug-addicted hobo and needless to say he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not content. Next line he seeks his veins so he can alter his reality with dope.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dog at your back step\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nWith reference to the dog, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m certain that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6dog = heroin. For one thing \u00e2\u0080\u0098dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a slang term for heroin(anyone can look that up). \u00e2\u0080\u0098dog at your back step\u00e2\u0080\u0099 = thoughts of getting high stay in the back of his mind, and he constantly \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalls\u00e2\u0080\u009d = \u00e2\u0080\u0098gives into addiction\u00e2\u0080\u0099 b/c \u00e2\u0080\u009che lets go\u00e2\u0080\u009d = cant fight addiction anymore. His \u00e2\u0080\u009cnet\u00e2\u0080\u009d = \u00e2\u0080\u0098whatever he used to keep himself from using\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009chas rot away\u00e2\u0080\u009d = self explanatory. Next two lines as if he had just explain his situation says \u00e2\u0080\u009cso\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then repeats first two lines\u00e2\u0080\u00a6meaning he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to get high.\r\n-\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Trash Fire is warm\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m certain \u00e2\u0080\u0098trash fire\u00e2\u0080\u0099 refers to the \u00e2\u0080\u0098rush\u00e2\u0080\u0099 one gets from mainlining smack. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Trash\u00e2\u0080\u0099 b/c heroin is a dirty drug and trash is appropriate. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Fire\u00e2\u0080\u0099 b/c fire can either kill you or keep you warm, just like heroin. Any junkie will tell you heroin, esp. the \u00e2\u0080\u0098rush\u00e2\u0080\u0099, gives one a warm fuzzy feeling but too much can easily kill you just like fire.  \r\n-When he \u00e2\u0080\u009ctouches clean with a dirty hand\u00e2\u0080\u009d he takes a clean needle with a hand that intends to dirty it up with dope. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTouch the clean to the waste\u00e2\u0080\u009d =  touching needle to the \u00e2\u0080\u0098waste\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or heroin and sucks it up. Now if you notice when he says this line his vocal tone and back music is rather intense and next line when he says \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrash fire is warm\u00e2\u0080\u009d his tone and back music abruptly changes to a more subtle tone, meaning he just got high. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe from the storm\u00e2\u0080\u009d = he cant go anywhere without thinking about getting high. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is done and to do\u00e2\u0080\u009d = all the repugnant things his addiction made him do and the things to he probably will end up doing.\r\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou let this dog in from the rain, though it just wants right back out again\u00e2\u0080\u009d = he keeps using like it will solve his problems, when really he knows no matter how much he uses the high is only temporary and when its gone he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go right back to his sorrow filled reality. \r\nI am so positive about this b/c I used to be a heroin addict and this guy hit a lot of nerves close to home.

Its a very philosophical song. \r\nas usual the hero of this metallica song just like of many other songs is an outcast. S/he's a very humane or 'good-natured' person who cannot addapt to stark reality, society and it's material values. It doesn't necceserilly mean the hero is a hobo or an addict. Sometimes everyone can feel like a low man, especially in the presence of an illness, death or any other despeate situation that you haven't control of. So this song may be about any eldery, disabled or simply depressed person who has a lot of regrets about wasted time, opportunities. 'Veins' may imply the flow of life, past time. 'The storm' may imply any accident or disaster. As to 'i fall cause i let go': many of us promise ourselves to 'give up smoking' or 'having junk food' or 'start spending more time with the ones we love' but eventually a rare delivers the promise and...one day regrets. If today was the last day, i'm sure everyone (maybe except 'the lost generation') had some regrets  and wanted somebody to forgive us. As to 'the trashfire is warm': the working class or even christian values may be hidden under the phrase because a rare can boast about possesing posh mansions and limousines yet meets the basic  needs of food and home.

I want to offer something different from the \"drug\" or \"suicide\" angle.  What if it's just about a guy that's an asshole.  Hear me out.  You also have to assume, because of the lyrics later, that there is a woman in his life.\n\nThe first verse that repeats.  \"His eyes seek reality, his fingers feel for veins.\"  Could this be to mean he seeks his meaning and life, veins are the conduit for blood that is the life of the body.  In the context of the first verse, \"there's a dog at your back step, he must come in from the rain\" He could be an asshole, hence dog, and come in from the rain could mean to change his life.  Seeking reality of a new life, fingers feel the veins, checking the pulse to see if it's there.  The woman eluded in lyrics ahead is giving this asshole a chance.\n\n\"I fall \u00e2\u0080\u0098cause I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve let go\" simply, this guy doesn't care about anyone or anything.\n\"The net below has rot away\"  what caring there was in the past is no longer there.\n\"So my eyes seek reality, And my fingers seek my veins\" again his eyes might \"want\" this new life, but there might not be a \"pulse\" there, hence no life.\n\nThe whole \"trash fire is warm\" part of the song I attribute to just this guys life roaming around, each place is warm in his comfort zone, but he causes problems everywhere he goes \"no where's safe from the storm\".  He could be an older man now who is starting to get tired of it and tries to change \"can't bear to see what I've let me be, so wicked and worn\".   \n\nThe next part we assume \"so as I write to you\" he's writing a Dear John letter to the woman that took a chance.  Like he's done in the past, he probably used her for his benefit, \"what is done and to do\" and is moving on.  He hopes that she'll understand that in the end, sometimes you simply just can't change people, and she won't \"cry for this man\"  I struggle with \"because Low man is due\" because in any context, what is he due, other than failure.\n\nThen we have \"Touch clean with a dirty hand, I touch the clean to the waste\"  I interprete this, in the context that this is just about some asshole man, that in his new life, he's cleaned up, stable, but his past \"dirty hand\" is still there.  Again, \"my eyes seek reality, my fingers feel for faith\" His eyes still seek this new life, but with no pulse previously, he looks to faith to help change him, which ultimately fails.\n\n\"So low the sky is all I see.\" This person he is with was a really great person, and he feels especially bad for causing the pain that he did, he's at his lowest point.  \"All I want for you is forgive me\"  speaks for itself, but then he does a complete 180 with \"so you bring this poor dog in from the rain\" she gave the man a chance, \"though he just wants right back out again\" but in the end, he just wants to continue being an asshole.\n\n\"And I cry to the alleyway, Confess all to the rain, But I lie, lie straight to the mirror, The one I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve broken to match my face.\"  I see this as actually triumph on the Low man's part.  Think of it like the ending of Shawshank Redemption when Andy breaks through and he's crying in happiness in the rain. Low man confesses what he is unapologetically.  The mirror is what he was trying to be, but he breaks it because he can't be that man, thus the broken mirror is who he really is.\n\nThat's my take, it may not be as deep as other people or as dramatic, maybe it's just not as deep as it's made out to be.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_83": "\nThis song touches on multiple subjects including addiction, homelessness and forgiveness but primarily conveys a sense of regret.
