He's saying he wants his luck to stay with him the way a lady would. \"You might refuse to stay/\r\nAnd so the best that I can do is pray.\" He hopes his luck will stick with him.\n\r\n\"The pickings have been lush\r\nAnd yet before the evening is over\r\nYou might give me the brush\"\n\r\n^^He's been lucky so far but by the end of the night his luck could run out. It's about gambling in Vegas. Simple. Great song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI feel like this song is aboug sex, but i suppose i'm really only basing that idea on \"a lady doesn't wander all over the room, and blow on some other guys dice\".\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song was played in Guys and Dolls, and Marlon Brando also knocked it out of the park. It's strictly about a gambler wishing that luck would be with him when throws as he tosses a lucky seven or even boxcars. This tune makes me a Sinatra fan.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nLuck is fleeting, she can be with you one moment and blessing the guy next to you at any time, with no warning. Ol' Blue Eyes just wants her to stay with him for the night.\n\r\nAwesome song, easily my favorite from Sinatra. The trumpets and tempo are incredible...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
