Listen to all their songs, from their first album listen to the lyrics hard, keep listening to the albums notice the progression of their music, or drop some acid or some type of psychedelic (no drug, psychedelic, big difference between an intoxicant and a psychedelic BIG DIFFERENCE) The Beatles dropped acid, all four of them, there wasn't denying it amongst them. 1965 began the entire explosion in musical creativity the beatles are well known to have made the first psychedelic rock album (mainstream among millions of fans, just as LSD was reaching millions of people)..

I am somewhat amused at how clueless most people seem to be.  Not that I am anybody special but I came of age at the peak of the Beatles' popularity.  \nThe Beatles were trying to turn people on to great esoteric truths, things which cannot always be taught directly.  The Sargent Pepper Album was very much about that.\nI do not think Lennon was lying when he said the song was inspired by his son's drawing, but the song was certainly about more than that.  \nSomething that commonly occurred when using psychedelic drugs, especially with  groups of people who were close was a certain flowing together of personalities and a sort of \"ego loss' where the oneness of existence is perceived.  This may sound like gibberish, but if it ever happened to you it would be clear to what I am referring.\nNow let me relate what I have just said to the lyrics of \"Lucy in the Sky\"\n\"the girl with kaleidoscope eyes\" - the nature of a kaleidoscope is a tube with many mirrors.  You look in and the mirrors cause the bits of colored glass or plastic to form brilliant patterns.  The word eye sounds the same as the word I.  Kaleidoscope \"I's\" could refer to perceiving the world as a million reflections of yourself.\nPicture yourself in a train in a station with plasticine porters with looking glass ties.\nIt seems the picture being painted is of railway porters with neckties with mirrors on them (looking-glasses).  But the word tie has more than one meaning; it can also mean the ties between people, that which connects them.  Porters conduct people from one place to another.  In other words when you perceive the tie between yourself and another it is like looking into a mirror.\nIf you think I am off the track just look at how much of the Beatles music returns to this theme.\nJust some thoughts on this subject.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nSorry to shatter the dreams of people who think that the beatles would never write a song about LSD (i joke) but Sir Paul admitted himself that this wang was about LSD. news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_17": "\nObviously, the song is about some girl named Lucy Uchiha, who has the Mangekyou Sharingan.\n\nI mean, she has kaleidoscope eyes.

First of all i believe that the song was about LSD and that because it wasn't socially acceptable for the Beatles to be open about this Lennon invented the story about the picture. Secondly i agree that it is irrelevant anyway. People should gather their own interperatations from music and see the song through their own expeiriences.\r\nBy the way-The guy who wrote about Pamelas Hepititis and Britneys boobs, i salute you...that was a great point.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_68": "\nWhen I think of comparing celebrities, I definitely think of comparing John Lennon to Britney Spears or Pamela Anderson.

Kinda reminds me though of how people are saying that the Wizard of Oz (the book version) was written as a political tract, when there's nothing to substantiate that that was Baum's intention, and when in fact Baum himself said it was a children's story in one of his forewords and wasn't meant to be deeply analyzed.  My whole point is, you can take any song or piece of work and twist it into anything you want by just pointing out a few parralels (like how my friend is trying to convince me that Hobbits are potheads--they smoke all the time, they eat all the time, and they hate travelling.)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_69": "\njohn lennon may have been on LSD during the course of the beatles era, but this song definitely isnt about that. it is about a picture john's son drew that had skies with diamonds in it.  this is definitely my favorite song ever, it seems to just take you away when the first \"lucy in the sky with diamonds\" is sung.  it is one of those songs where it has no exact meaning, but anyway you interpret it is right.  i am a huge beatles fan and this song turned me into an even bigger one.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_70": "\ni say it does not matter..maybe it has no meaning..maybe it was a pic julian drew..maybe it was about LSD..we could argue for years..why cant we just all agree on one thing..its a good song\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_71": "\nI love you DuckFetus...you're a very smart person.

I've seen a picture that is supposedly the original drawing (67.19.222.106/music/graphics/\u2026). However, even if the chorus was about the picture, it doesn't explain the verses. If Theory #1 is true, then the verses are just Lennon expanding on the fantastical child's imagination world. The song does have a childlike sound to it.\n\r\nTheory #2:\r\nThe song is about the LSD experience. Lennon was lying to protect his reputation. I have a friend who's done acid and we were discussing the idea that \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" is not about drugs and he said \"If you've ever done psychedelics, you know it is.\" Additionally, the references to kaleidoscopes suggest it is about the effects of acid. There are numerous (possible) references to drug use-- \"Climb in the back with your head in the clouds and you're gone\" (the clouds probably describe the feeling, not clouds of smoke--different drug) and \"the flowers/that grow so incredibly high\".

John and the other Beatles (but mainly John) were doing a LOT of acid at the time.\r\n2.  Rock stars were getting busted a LOT around this time for possessing drugs.\r\n3.  Society was starting to pay a lot of attention to the decadence of the drug culture that was coming into being at the time.\r\n4.  Brian Epstein was still alive.\r\n5.  John was a savvy capitalist and the financial success of the Beatles was very important to him.\r\n6.  John was still smarting from the financial and professional damage done to the Beatles by his \"bigger than Jesus\" comment.\n\r\nOkay, lets combine the elements into this stew:\n\r\nJohn was very excited about the pleasurable and mind expanding effects of LSD and wanted to write about it to a) spread the word and b)write a song that would be great to trip to (as most of the songs on Sgt Pepper were).  Plus, the Beatles would have had a great laugh over the LSD initials in the title.  After having written and recorded this masterpiece, they played it for Brian Epstein, their manager, who promptly flipped out told them that they must never never never admit that this song has anything to do with drugs or LSD, else another shitstorm of controversy would fall on them similar to the one caused by John's \"bigger than Jesus\" statement.  Or even worse, it could draw the attention of Scotland Yard who were busting pop stars left and right at the time in response to conservative British society's outcry over blatant drug use and endorsement by the youth movement and their spokesmen, pop stars.  \n\r\nThe \"admit nothing\" strategy worked very well and the Beatles continued their incredible commercial success.  John DID get busted for drugs, but let off with a slap on the wrist.  \"Society\" moved on to easier targets \n\r\nThe origin of the name of the song may or may not be factual, but one thing is for sure...you can NOT trust John's statements that it wasn't about acid.  John knew it was about acid and the people he was writing to knew it was about acid.  Everybody else had to be content with the \"Julian's drawing\" story.\n\r\nJohn was a genius, and this event proves it...he writes the best song ever for (and about) acid tripping and is smart enough to know that to admit what it is really about would be a financial and professional disaster, so he concocts and maintains the big lie that keeps everybody happy.  The song was great and the lie was great and everybody got out their wallets.

It never was, and nobody believes me. I swear to God, or swear to Mao, or to anybody you like, I had no idea it spelt LSD. This is the truth: My son came home with a drawing and showed me this strange looking woman flying around. I said 'What is it?' and he said 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds,' and I thought, 'that's beautiful.' I immediately wrote a song about it. And the song had gone out, the whole album had been published, and somebody noticed that the letters spelt out LSD. It wasn't about that at all. The images were from Alice in Wonderland. It was Alice in the boat. She is buying an egg and it turns into Humpty Dumpty. It's not an acid song.\"\n\r\nThat about clears it all up for me.

Your brain, in response, produces hallucinations which can be merely a distortion of reality or a creation of reality--sight, sound, etc. In 'street terms' this is called a trip (among other things) and so, the wild images in the Beatles' \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" could be considered a song written, perhaps, from the experience of the writer's 'trip', perhaps even to be tied in with the son: perhaps some of his hallucinations were affected by his son's mentioning of a friend named Lucy.

This song is amazing.\n\r\nI was first introduced to this song as a piece I was required to play for a concert. I immediately fell in love with the upbeat melody. When I read the lyrics and researched the meaning, I was honestly surprised.\n\r\nI guess I just never realized that the Beatles were so dark in their music. Dark in a sense, at least. I assume because I hadn't heard all of thier songs and was only familiar with the most well known tracks.\n\r\nI truthfully haven't read all of the comments, but from the jist of things, I understand that most of the commenters assumed it was about LSD. While it really doesn't matter, because it's their personal life and is a well written song, it is interesting to discover the true meaning, origin and basis of the song.\n\r\nI found this website concerning the LSD claim. I'm not sure if everything included is factual, but I thought the source was pretty reliable. The site is: snopes.com/music/hidden/\u2026\n\r\nPretty much, it says that the entire LSD \"hidden meaning\" is coincidental, and that John Lennon didn't realize the initials of the son until after it was released; completely unintentional. Apparently his four-year old son, Julian, had drawn a picture titled \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" or something of the sort, and it inspired him to create the song.\n\r\nAgain, while it really doesn't matter whether the song was about drugs or ot, I thought that I would provide another perspective of the situation.\n\r\nYou make what you want out of it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_208": "\ncould i point out that it would be pretty much impossible to write any half decent song whilst on any half decent drug. so this song and lsd both being rather top notch, the 'written on drugs' theory just doesn't cut it for me. also, lsd is not an acronym since an acronym has to make a new word like s.w.a.l.k or whatever.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_209": "\nswatch\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_210": "\nseveral drug references. \"thedaytheMUSIC died\" I think it would be naive to believe what lennon said about his own song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_211": "\nHmmm, I don't think I clarified myself in my last comment.\n\r\nI did not intend to state the song was not about drugs.

Sad songs are for when you feel down and need a good cry. Pop songs are for when your happy and feel like singing along.

Ok this is the meaning I see out of this song,  before i even knew there was a picture made by his son I always thought that the song was a drug reference AND had a strange tie to a childs imagination.  Most people that automaticly rail on the \"drug users\"  (which is usualy the funloving peaceful people that usualy listen to beatles.)  dismiss them with the picture.  sorry one more thing i noticed is nobody made the tie of the part of the song mentioning \"the sun\"  and an acid trip.  which is something that i heard happens to a lot of people on acid where a glowing yellow tone takes over their vision.  \r\nBut this is what i got out of the song...\n\r\nIf you keep the picture in mind i think when lennon got the picture he thought it could be a good song.  I think when he threw it across the band they realized the acronym and I think thats why the song seems to be pieced together at latter times.  but the meaning that i got out of it is how acid is similar to a childs imagination of bright colors and optimistic visuals.  it shows how so much of the visuals tie into the overemotional feeling on the drug (ex: the tone of the song after the line 'and your gone')  It could show irony in how LSD users are like children or trying to be children again.  or it could show how no drug can replace the feelings felt as a child.  thats just some things off the top of my head.  but the main thing that i have always gotten out of it is that it is a comparison of LSD and the raw imagination of a child.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_382": "\nthis board is perpetually trolled by 13 year olds who don't know shit about drugs and thus refuse to believe that one of the greatest bands in rock history would EVER write \r\nsongs about LSD or pot.\r\nnay, not the Beatles.  never.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_383": "\nLook, people. The Beatles were heavy drug users, theres no question about that. And, they wrote several songs about drugs, like Happiness Is A Warm Gun, Tommorrow Never Knows, and Rain just to name a few. So , just to set the record straight, I'm not some Beatles purist who claims The Beatles never took drugs or any of that bull. However, with that being said, \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\" is most certainly not a drug song. Now let me explain:\n\r\nJulian Lennon, John Lennon's son, came home from school one day and showed his father a picture he drew of a girl in his class named Lucy. According to John, it was literally a picture of a girl, supposedly named Lucy, who was in the clothing of an angel, with bright colors for eyes (hence the \"kaleidoscope eyes part). She was in the sky, surrounded by diamond shaped stars. When John asked Julian what the picture was, Julian said, \"It's Lucy in the Sky, and with diamonds.\" John Lennon, being so inspired by his sons beautiful picture and imagination, got the idea for a song that would later become \"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\".\n\r\nNow, I'm sure all of you have heard that story. Now, where did the supposedly \"LSD inspired lyrics\" that had nothing to do with the picture come from? At this time, John Lennon was extremely interested in the writings of Lewis Carrol, who was a renowned poet and short story writer. He wrote mostly tales for children, such as Alice in Wonderland. If any of you are familiar with Carroll's works, you can see a great resemblance between his writings and this song. Lennon was inspired by him, and used his style of writing (vivid imagery) as the basis for some of his songs. That's where the trippy lyrics come from.\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, no one really considered \"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\" to be a drug song until Paul McCartney suggested it given the acronym \"LSD\". Then it became the accepted view of the song.\n\r\nSo, hopefully this has shed some light on the real meaning of this song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_384": "\nNow the lyrics were probably influenced by LSD, but not directly about LSD.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_385": "\nHow about reading what I said\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_386": "\nif it's about drugs it wouldn't surprise me. the beatles always pulled publicity stunts like that.. just let it go and let the beatles songs be open to interpretation. there isn't a DIRECT meaning to it. chillll.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_387": "\nDRUGSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_388": "\n(L)ucy in the (S)ky with (D)iamonds\n\r\nL.S.D  simple enough really\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_389": "\nwell.......he could have seen the picture his son drew of his friend and been inspired to write a fantasy song and of course the lsd helped the imagination run free...\r\nand are we not all glad it did!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_390": "\nif one has a strong mind with the capacity to think and deal with abstractions, the use of 'drugs' can open doors and free you into the quantum unified field.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_391": "\nOkay, clearly, I don't actually know the true answer to the meaning of this song, but I am getting a little annoyed with the way people so blindly trust every word john Lennon said.\n\r\nI mean, face it.

Just about everyone was doing drugs in one form or another and we were no different, but the writing was too important for us to mess it up by getting off our heads all the time.\n\r\nThe only reason he made up the story about the picture was because the beatles started loosing airplay in England because of drug-references.\n\nmsnbc.msn.com/id/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_430": "\nwhy argue about it being about lsd. i knew this is what all the comments would be :|\r\nittttttt is an epic song, i love the imagery\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_431": "\nthis is about the picture, but i think its also DEFINATELY inspired by an lsd experience, there is too many things he is singing about.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_432": "\ncmon john, \r\nyou really expect us to believe that story about your sons drawing?\r\nits ok we all know what you were up to :D\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_433": "\nOkay. \n\r\nFirst off, I think /L/ucy in the /S/ky with /D/iamonds was influenced by LSD - I'm not convinced that it's just a mere coincidence that the nouns in the title spell out the acronym 'LSD'.\n\r\nHowever, I also think it's ridiculous that people are saying \"UGH he couldn't have written this without LSD\" because that's insulting.

Carroll, aka REVEREND Charles Dodgson, was born in 1832 - LSD usage was obviously very rare during his time seeing as it was NOT synthesized until the 1930s which came 40 years after his death in 1898. Carroll was just trying to write a fun childrens' story.\n\r\n(I know that stating he's a reverend does not dismiss his 'odd' relationship with Alice Liddell, but weren't relationships of that nature fairly normal in that era?

Now, be rational here:  If you were unaware of any details of who wrote this song, didn't know it was by the Beatles, but knew that the writer frequently dropped acid, what rational conclusion does that bring you to?  On a scale of 1-10, 1 being absolutely clear that LSD played no role whatsoever in this song, 10 being absolutely clear it did, anyone who ranks a 1 is so hopelessly, ignoratnly ignoring the facts (and the lyrics) that there is no point discussing it with them.
