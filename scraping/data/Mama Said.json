{"comment_0": "\nIt sounds like a son who after loses his mother acts like its no big deal, and then later in life he realizes just how important she was to him. He tells the story out of order for dramatic effect so timeline-wise the story really starts with these lines:\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Rebel, my new last name\r\nWild blood in my veins\r\nApron strings around my neck\r\nThe mark that still remains\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\r\n \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cutting the apron strings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a saying which means going off and being physically and emotionally independent from your mum, so he may have initially perceived her as a limiting force when he says things like \u00e2\u0080\u0098apron strings around my neck\u00e2\u0080\u0099. With this verse he communicates his need to rebel at that point in life and to reject domestic life which was the domain of his mother. He has \u00e2\u0080\u0098wild blood\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in his veins and he wanted to get out and be independent. When he says \u00e2\u0080\u0098the mark that still remains\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it could mean a few things, either that up until this point he always remembered his mother in the negative light of someone he wanted to escape or alternatively it could mean that this negative relationship that he had with mother when she was dying has scarred him for life. \n\r\nHe then goes on to say that he left home young and that might be wrong but he knows that leaving home after she died isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the problem here, it was his relationship with her. I think he puts this line in there about leaving home to say that he was always going to leave and go do big things anyway, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just leaving her specifically.\n\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come to the chorus later, now we go back to the first verse where he is an adult looking back and he viewing his mother more fondly:\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mama, she has taught me well\r\nTold me when I was young\r\n\"Son, your life's an open book\r\nDon't close it 'fore it's done\"\n\r\n\"The brightest flame burns quickest\"\r\nThat's what I heard her say\r\nA son's heart sowed to mother\r\nBut I must find my way\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\r\nHere it looks like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s realized that she was wise in her own way and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only as an adult can he understand that wisdom. The \u00e2\u0080\u0098brightest flame\u00e2\u0080\u0099 line is interesting because it shows that he sees that she really did understand him and his extreme creation/destruction tendencies. For those who were wondering there is a line in Blade Runner where they say that \u00e2\u0080\u0098a star that burns twice as bright burns twice as fast\u00e2\u0080\u0099 so the \u00e2\u0080\u0098brightest flame burns quickest\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a similar concept, ie being spent up by your lifestyle. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not surprised to hear James use fire metaphors after his pyrotechnics accident!\n\r\nNow the next verse:\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mama, now I'm coming home\r\nI'm not all you wished of me\r\nA mother's love for her son\r\nUnspoken, help me be\n\r\nYeah, I took your love for granted\r\nNot a thing you said to me\r\nI need your arms to welcome me\r\nBut a cold stone's all I see\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\r\nSo now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ready to come back to that relationship with his mum after all the growing that he has done away from her. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a successful musician and he wants her to be proud but it sounds like he might not think that he was the best person. He wants her to help him and comfort him, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ready for that guidance and love again. However, the sorrow at the heart of the song is that she died. He wants her to hold him in her arms but all he has got to embrace is her tombstone.\n\r\nPersonally I see the verses as being there to tell the story and I see the chorus and bridge as direct expressions of this sorrow:\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let my heart go\r\nLet your son grow\r\nMama, let my heart go\r\nOh, let this heart be still\n\r\nLet my heart go\r\nMama, let my heart go\r\nYou never let my heart go\r\nSo, let this heart be still\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\r\nThese chorus lines are far more ambiguous than the verses, so they could mean a lot of things. The pain he feels is pretty clear, in light of the story in the verses I think he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been able to escape the pain of losing her, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been able to move on from that pain or be free of that pain. His mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got his heart, ie he still feels extraordinary love for her and it pains him. So he seems to be asking to be free of that pain or at least to \u00e2\u0080\u0098let this heart be still\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which might mean he wants peace from this emotional turmoil.  You could interpret it literally that he wanted her to let him go when he was a teenager but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really fit in with the rest of the emotion. And the bridge part:\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Never I ask of you\r\nBut never I gave\r\nBut you gave me your emptiness\r\nI now take to my grave\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Emptiness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is another ambiguous word, he could be saying a lot of things here. I think not having her has left an emptiness in his life, and that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be filled. \n\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty revealing song, we never really saw this side of James before Nothing Else Matters so its great that he started to become comfortable in expressing his deeper emotional stuff! Anyway this was my interpretation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s alarmingly long but it think the song has got a lot in it!\n\n\n", "comment_1": "\n\"Never I ask of you\r\nBut never I gave\r\nBut you gave me your emptiness\r\nI now take to my grave\" \n\r\nRead that and imagine the mother saying those lines.

She is trying to cause him guilt for leaving and is trying to use her so-called love (apron strings around his neck), which she was empty of in the first place, to keep him home. And now that he has finally decided to leave, he is heartbroken because, even though he knows its for his own good, his mother wouldnt let him go for her own selfish need of trying to fulfill her emotional emptyness through him, which she was never satisfied with in the first place even when he showed his love to her.\n\r\nWhoa, I took this to a whole new level didnt I, lol.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nits doubtful that James was smothered with love - just look at some other lyrics relating to his family. Seems like he had a strict but inconsistent upbringing. If his dad was mean then he'd want his mum to confort him but maybe she was too scared to protect him.

Her explaining \"The brightest flame burns quickest\" is her way of telling him if he tries to rush through life he will skip through childhood and never really enjoy his life. He needs to slow down and take his time, rather than rush through life and dim out.\n\nUnfortunately he refuses to listen like many of us have done. We tried so hard to get out crap together and move on. We didn't want to live under a matriarch or someone else's rules so we just moved out without a plan. \n\nHe is explaining that he needs to get out and figure it out himself.\n-----------------------------------\n\nLet my heart go\nLet your son grow\nMama, let my heart go\nOr let this heart be still\nYeah, still\n--------------------------------\n\nIn this it is merely explaining that he is telling his mother to let him go, let him experience life, let him grow up the rest of the way on his own because he has big plans. He needs to get out.\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nRebel, my new last name\nWild blood in my veins\nApron strings around my neck\n\nThe mark that still remains\nLeft home at an early age\nOf what I heard was wrong\nI never asked forgiveness\nBut what is said is done\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhen he first realized he was free he started doing all types of stuff a typical kid would do without supervision. He was trying to say that in the beginning it was touch and go, trying to find his place in the world... living life in the fast lane, his music career taking off and him and the band lived without any sense of responsibility. They drank and partied, went on tour, They were wild in the beginning. The band was also known as Alcoholica because of the wild parties they had, as well as the drinking... But during this he when the party stopped and he was alone he reflected on the how he grew up. He kind of missed the domestic life and he misses it by saying the mark that still remains from having Apron Strings around his neck.\n\nHe also reflects on how he left home, it seems like there were some words between him and his mother and he left on bad terms. He may have explained how he left to one of the band members and they told him he screwed up. His guilt is thick in the last lines... I never asked forgiveness, but what I said is done. He may have had the last words, and those words broke his mothers heart, and he can't take it back. He is too proud to ever admit to his mother that he was wrong, and he was sorry.\n----------------------------------------\n\nNever I ask of you\nBut never I gave\nBut you gave me your emptiness that I'll take to my grave\n-------------------------------------------\n\nHe has even more guilt in these lyrics because he never asked for forgiveness... and he will also never give her forgiveness in return.\nThe animosity between the two still remains, and he will take that empty feeling, and sadness with him to his grave\n---------------------------------------------\n\nMama, now I'm coming home\nI'm not all you wished of me\nA mother's love for her son\nUnspoken, and maybe\nYeah, I took your love for granted\nAnd all the things you said to me\nI need your arms to welcome me\nBut, a cold stone's all I see\n---------------------------------------\n\nOn the road he heard of his mother's passing. He is coming home for to bury her... He explains that she was disappointed in him for his life choices, but he feels like she should have loved him anyways. He regrets the same thing many of us do when a family member dies. He figured she would be around forever. So he realizes that he took it for granted and he wished to reconcile their differences, but it was too late as he stood over her grave..\n\n\nThis might sound too literal, but I can relate. I moved away from my mother on terrible terms. I moved 2000 miles away and recently she died in a house fire. I went up to participate in the services and it was too late. I couldn't take anything back, and every day now... I wish I could have called her up and said I am sorry.\n\nThis song really resonates with me now that I understand his pain in a very similar manner.\n\nReally eye opening song. Always squash your differences with a family member. Things happen, and it might be too late to take things back.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_45": "\nI think there's something here that rings with every guy.

Fade To Black now ranks in at second place. Although my mom isn't dead, I can relate to these lyrics so well. And the tune, james' voice, and what not almost made me cry. Their best.

I dunno, when I think ballads, I think of \"Nothing Else Matters,\" but hey, to each his own.
