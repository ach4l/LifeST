When James shouts before the guitar solo, he says \"FACE ME,\" not \"fix me.\"  Second, no offense to anyone, but why argue over whether or not it is specifically about a herione or a cocaine addiction? Really, people. For me, the song isn't even about drugs or a drug addict. Yes, that is what it is saying on the surface, but for me it is saying that we are all being pulled by the strings of fate (or being toyed around with by god), with absolutely no power over ourselves. As humans, we enjoy our destructive behavior, no matter how much it makes us suffer, and in a way our dark nature is like a drug that we simply cannot get enough of, or come to terms with and overcome.

The 'Master' being the drug, and the 'Puppet' being the user.\n\nEnd of passion play, crumbling away\nI'm your source of self-destruction\n\nPerson is starting to experience the negative effects of drugs, the addiction. It's no longer to feel good, but to stop feeling bad.\n\nVeins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear\nLeading on your death's construction\n\nAfraid to lose the 'good' feeling drugs give, but also constructing their own death.\n\nTaste me you will see\nMore is all you need\nDedicated to\nHow I'm killing you\n\nCome crawling faster\nObey your Master\nYour life burns faster\nObey your Master\nMaster\n\nThe craving for the next high is symbolised here, how you'll crawl faster and die faster by 'Obeying' the 'Master'; giving in to your next dosage.\n\nMaster of Puppets I'm pulling your strings\nTwisting your mind, smashing your dreams\nBlinded by me, you can't see a thing\nJust call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream\nMaster\nMaster\nJust call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream\nMaster\nMaster\n\nChorus is pretty straight-forward, drugs ruin one's life, totally blinded and screaming for more. 'Master, master!', the puppet screams.\n\nNeedlework the way, never you betray\nLife of death becoming clearer\nPain monopoly, ritual misery\nChop your breakfast on a mirror\n\nYou'll find yourself doing drugs for breakfast, 'chopping' one's breakfast on a mirror symbolises the way cocaine is taken in, being 'chopped' up into a line using a straight razor and then inhaled through the nose. Doing so on a mirror is to symbolise how one watches his own destruction, due to this.\n\nHere the song breaks down, going into a calm, instrumental bit until it builds up to a fierce guitar solo. You can assume here that the Puppet has tried to free himself from his Master's reign, by no longer using the drugs. But because the craving for another high rises, the song speeds up and becomes more aggressive, showing the Puppet has been tied by his Master's strings again.\n\nMaster, Master, where's the dreams that I've been after?\nMaster, Master, you promised only lies\nLaughter, laughter, all I hear or see is laughter\nLaughter, laughter, laughing at my cries\nFix me!\n\n\"Fix me!\", kinda shows the user was feeling broken without his daily dose, and therefore gives in again to the Master.\n\nHell is worth all that, natural habitat\nJust a rhyme without a reason\n\nHere the Master soothes its Puppet into believing his addiction is a good thing.\n\nNeverending maze, drift on numbered days\nNow your life is out of season\nI will occupy\nI will help you die\nI will run through you\nNow I rule you too\n\nAddicted again, the Puppet is assumed to be dead at the end of the song as we hear laughter, mocking the Puppet for ever giving in to the Master of Puppets.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nSong about drug addiction\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nA Metal Metaphor:                                                                                 Drug Addiction as Enslavement                        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nOK, first of, \"oldschoolpunker,\" why don't you cut the crap and take your negative comments elsewhere.  Second, metallica themselves have never done drugs, or have never done it to the point of addiction.

First the name Master comes from the word Lord, which comes from canaan, a land of Elohim worshippers or God worshippers, also a people the chosen ones were to enter into and anialate utterly, sparing nothing alive or inanimate, nor picking up any of the accursed objects the canaanites used in their rituals. They were warned that if they left anyone alive that eventually these people would enter into marriage with the hebrews and a time would come when the one would ask the canaanite, \"How was it that you worshipped your Elohim (singular word refers to all the creation as one, or God). And So you have Master a word used by satan worshippers which means lord and both come from the words el and elohim, or baal. Now juxtapose this in contrast to the fact that the christian churches use this Title Lord to refer to either a Husband, Jesus or Zeus (once the greeks got ahold of the texts) or the Heavenly Father who commanded the Hebrews through Mosheh (moses) only to refer to him as father, or Yahweh which is his only name. So you have to remember that James was somehow privy to info that his preacher dad wasn't and he's making a very wide and bold statement to all, and all of the above is included, but if you leave these facts out you aren't worthy. Now the only lyrics I saw that reference drugs or could is the mirror thing. But remember, this song is broke into two totally seperate pieces from a musicians point of view, and the second have is what man thinks he would say to the one he called master. But Yahweh would simply say, get away from me, I never knew you. without saying it of course cuz he owes no one that stupid anything, and the laughter you hear is judgement without anything more need be said.

Everyone has their own interpretation of each song. There is no right or wrong interpretation. When someone explains the meaning of a song they are explaining what it means to THEM, not others. Each person's interpretation often reflects on their personality and life experiences so people may have different interpretations.\n\r\nNow, James Hetfield may have had a particular meaning in mind when he wrote it but that's what the lyrics mean to HIM. Song lyrics are just a bunch of words and sentences arranged in a meaninful way and therefore could mean very different things to the author and the reader. Just because those lyrics mean a particular thing to the author of them, doesn't mean that's the \"right\" interpretation. Lyrics by themselves mean nothing, they require people to add meaning to them. The meaning of a song only exists as people interpret it and therefore there are many different meanings for each song of which none are wrong.\n\r\nSo stop bashing people because they disagree with your interpretation or the popular interpretation.\n\r\nBesides, the text above the comment box says \"What does this song mean to YOU?\". So by sharing their interpretation of the song, people are only answering the question they were asked in the first place. After all, that's the whole point of this site, to discuss and express what a song means to YOU so people can find out about a wide variety of interpretations. Bashing people just because they disagree with your interpretation or the popular interpretation just discourages discussion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_132": "\ni think that kookkie is right on the dot on this song. i know you all think there songs are about drugs but.....this one actually is\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_133": "\nI don't think this song is completely about drugs.  everyone in life has their own addiction and passion for something.  this song is about practicing control because if you don't than a master will reign over you, moving everything in you're life, and in the end all what you had chased turns out to be a mere fantasy.  therefore losing yourself and objectives in life.\r\n'I will help you die'  aswsome words. very strong.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_134": "\nI think its about a guy who called James Hetfield who took a shot in the mouth from a hairy russian roadie named Stanislav on September 28, 1991\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_135": "\nMaster of Puppets was released on 1986.

I get into the house and I drink some of my WHISKEY in a JAR but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ease the pain clearly caused by the THORN WITHIN. At this point even i know the only solutions to deal with the STRUGGLE WITHIN. In the SMALL HOURS of the morning I stare into the dark night and see ORION, but now is not the time to think about ASTRONOMY the pain is too much it feels like I'm TRAPPED UNDER ICE yet I cant seem to convince myself that its my fault, betrayed by who i thought was a friend and betrayed by THE JUDAS KISS now I go towards my bed in this old rugged house, how am I supposed to sleep in THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT after I shot him between the eyes and left him STONE DEAD FOREVER and at that point it felt like NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. I close my eyes and try to sleep hoping it will all just FADE to BLACK but THE MEMORY REMAINS clear to me that I will always be UNFORGIVEN and it worries me because the things i just did make me wonder AM I EVIL. This cant be I was raised right how did I turn to this BAD SEED I know what I did was wrong but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like I am on ANESTHESIA.\n\r\nI had lost my mind when I decided it was KILLING TIME, I ran around taking them all out high on drugs I believed I was the INVISIBLE KID and the opponents I took out one by one where DISPOSABLE HEROES. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep so I stay up looking at the DIRTY WINDOW and start to think maybe its time I DISAPPEAR because right now I am CREEPING DEATH at any point the cops and feds will be all over looking for me. For so long I looked forward to exerting my revenge but that day seemed to be THE DAY THAT NEVER COMES nothing hurts more than taking the life of your BROTHERS IN ARMS. The pain was too much yet still I feel like the HERO OF THE DAY and I decided not to think about what others thought of me after all to the one who I was revenging I would always be the perfect PRINCE CHARMING her LOVERMAN as was the case when she lived and everyone else called me KING NOTHING. As my nerves began to calm I remember what MAMA SAID about salvation forgiveness trusting in God and THE FOUR HORSEMEN but I will not pray to THE GOD THAT FAILED seeing as he let my loved one die she truly was MY FRIEND OF MISERY so I decide to live the rest of my life with NO REMORSE.\n\r\nKnowing my fate as I step into the bathroom that bottle of CYANIDE seems appealing but I will not give up I will FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. Arrested I find myself locked in a SANATARIUM because the cops couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any normal person could do what I did. The DEVILS DANCE is what they called it and maybe this is where I would spend the rest of my days on THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY. A brilliant mind I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve to be here but what i did deserves to be punished and that is SAD BUT TRUE. At this rate I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think even a priest can PURIFY my soul. I think of to myself POOR TWISTED ME but I decide to not have self pity because when it comes to who killed those men I will always be the ONE. From a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy RONNIE went on to become a killer and sometimes I would think SO WHAT right until the judge decided i would RIDE the LIGHTENING. I know I am SOME KIND of MONSTER but do I really deserve to die. The judge is not letting me off easy as he proclaims THAT WAS JUST YOUR LIFE and now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached THE END OF THE LINE. Alone in my cell I think it seems I have become THE OUTLAW TORN thinking about SUICIDE AND REDEMPTION what to do I cant let them kill me oh the STRUGGLE WITHIN talk about THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE.

I'm not here to tell you otherwise-a song has many levels and addiction is certainly one of the themes. To me, however, this song is about BDSM, specifically the Dominance/submission side of it. \nDominance/submission is a form of (sexual) power play between two or more partners. In this power play, the Dom is often referred to as the 'Master' and the sub as the 'slave'. Basically, the sub's purpose is to give the Dom pleasure, and because often the sub is masochistic and the Dom sadistic or sado-masochistic, this is achieved partially by the Dom hurting the sub. It's easy to imagine, however, that this could lead to the Dom hurting the sub beyond the boundaries of pleasure if things get out of hand.
