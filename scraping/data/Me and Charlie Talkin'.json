But young love normally doesn't last and \"Charlie\" moves away.  She waits for him to come back for her, but he has moved on in more than one sense and he doesn't come back for her.  And the chorus means when you find someone young you should try and hang on as long as possible, but soon you'll have to let go.  And it's \"when being lovers meant a stolen kiss\"  and also, \"the promises we made when we'd go walkin'.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nahhh, young love! :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nLOL\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
