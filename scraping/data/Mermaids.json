{"comment_0": "\nAt the concert in Offenbach, Nick told the audience, a bit joking, that this song is \"not about an old guy who watches young girls, but about the deception of ideas\". \nSo I always had this thought that the songs is indeed more than what it reads on paper, especially since the lyrics on \"Push the sky away\" became more abstract. But I couldn't figure out what it was.\nNow, it makes really sense when you look at it. Especially the lines:\n\"I believe in God\nI believe in mermaids too\nI believe in 72 virgins on a chain\nWhy not? Why not?\"\n...are an evidence for this, as it seems to me.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI think the line is \"I do driver alertness course\".\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
