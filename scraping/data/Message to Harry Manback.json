I kicked\r\nhim out after he stole some possessions\r\nfrom Jerry, and he called that night on the\r\nanswering machine because he was afraid\r\nof me, and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t threaten me to my face.\r\nHe was 6\u00e2\u0080\u00992\u00e2\u0080\u009d but only weighed 130 pounds\r\nand looked like Ichabod Crane from Sleepy\r\nHollow. I could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve broken him like a twig.\r\nHe called back again the next morning, and\r\nthat message was finally heard on Message\r\nto Harry Manback II on Salival. Anyway,\r\neveryone used to imitate it from my impression,\r\neven though they have never heard it.\r\nYears later, I found the tape and played it for\r\nFiglio di puttana, sai che tu sei un pezzo di\r\nmerda?* Hm? You think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cool, right?\r\nHm? When you kicked out people [out\r\nof] your house? I tell you this, one of three\r\nAmericans die of cancer, you know?

Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough courage for\r\nthat, I could, you know. You know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\r\ngonna have another accident? You know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\r\ninvolved with black magic? Fuck you! Die.\r\nBastard!\r\nYou think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so cool, hm? Asshole.

It is trying to tell you to read in between the lines. In Message to Harry Manbeck, the man is very angry and is saying bad things, but to a person who did not know Italian, it would sound very romantic, even though the lyrics are vicious. Now in Die Eier Von Satan, the lyrics are merely are cookie recipe. But since it is in German, a very dark sounding language, the message sounds very satanic. The song is showing the difference between the two, and telling you to look deeper into the song, instead of just reading the lyrics and saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009c ohh, that is such a bad song!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nDoes anyone know who the FUCK Harry is!
