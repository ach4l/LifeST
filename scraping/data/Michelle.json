The lyric mostly states very primal emotions about desire because anything more complicated is not possible due to the language barrier. The honesty is in that, despite the language barrier, there is really nothing more that could be said anyway. The cleverness is in using the French language, which not only sounds romantic to the English-speakers, but also uses the language barrier as a metaphor for what cannot be expressed through words about feelings, in any language. Using minor chords where he does also emphasizes the angst about wanting to say more than words allow. It's an amazing song in that, though the lyric is not sad, it produces an ambivalence of emotion, combining joy and melancholy. A rich palette in such a deceptively simple song. Between '66 and '67 Paul was at his peak that few writers can match. In my opinion, Paul wrote the 2nd and 3rd best American songs ever in Yesterday and Eleanor Rigby (the best being Mancini's and Merecer's Moon River).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI always thought it was \"sont les MOTS qui vont tres bien ensemble\".. as in.. these are the words that go together well...

I wonder how long they will allow my response to remain. We will see. \n\nMichelle Levallier was born April 5 1960 to Monique Levallier, a French make-up artist living in London, and J. Paul McCartney.  A young, broke and irresponsible Paul had several illegitimate children for which he did not acknowledge nor take responsibility .  When told of the pregnancy, Paul broke off the relationship. Devastated,  Monique moved back to Paris and had Michelle.  Upon Michele's 5th  birthday, Monique sent Paul an extremely  adorable photo of his daughter and told him that Michelle wanted to meet her father.  Paul was very moved by the image of his daughter. However, in 1965 he was in a serious relationship with Jane Asher and he was in the middle of BeatleMania.  Despite his best intentions, he never seemed to find time to go visit his daughter.  He must have felt shame for neglecting his responsibilities. At the same time based upon the song lyrics demonstrated his curiosity for the unconditional love that a father has for his daughter, even though they never met.  So, this song was written as a letter of introduction to his young, French speaking daughter  trying to assure her that although he never met her, that he loves her, that there are valid reasons why he is being a selfish prick and that he will find a way to make time to come see her.  I don't believe that ever happened.  Michelle eventually switched her surname to McCartney, became a bass musician and still lives in Los Angeles.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nyeah..that makes more sense.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nThe French chorus means the exact same thing as the English one: Michelle, ma belle (literally, \"my beautiful\", it's a term of endearnment)/these are words that go together well.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nSont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble\n\r\nSont: conjugation of the verb etre(to be)\r\nLes Mots: The words\r\nQui: who, or that\r\nvont: conjugation of the verb aller(to go)\r\nTres: Very\r\nBien: good or well\r\nEnsemble: together.\n\r\nSont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble means These are words that go together well.\n\r\nJe peu parle francais, j'etais dans immersion dans ecole.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nrubber soul was the first beatles album i'd ever heard, at the tender age of 6, so all of the songs from that album hold a special place in my heart.\n\r\ni used to sing this song all the time and i'd drive my parents crazy. i think it's basically just a simple little love song, really beautiful.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nMichelle.
