{"comment_0": "\nIt's about how he wants to be in the music business because he loves music, not because of the money he may make.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nAgree with the interpretation by Seeing above.\n\r\nSam Smith's mournful tone speaks to a certain social commentary about the state of music production today, indeed any kind of creative production, the self-expression of a person's deepest joy and craft, which has become digitized and commoditized.\n\r\nHe says he \"I don't have money on my mind,\" but there are no negatives in the brain. If you tell a person, \"I'm not thinking of a pink elephant,\" you know they can't help but be thinking of a pink elephant, because they had to have it in their brain to even speak those words.\n\r\nSo, I think this song elegantly addresses the struggle artists face.. of course they need to think about money. Money is survival, is compensation for their time and hard work, and they need to think about it, but it is a struggle to keep their joy in the craft authentic when faced with survival concerns.\n\r\n\"Don't want to see the numbers\r\nI want to see heaven\"\n\r\nSuch a beautiful lyric. Sam Smith is a bird with a beautiful voice who recognizes he is in a gilded cage now, as so many of us human beings are, because of the commodification of human beings. But he still sings softly of heaven and brings heaven to me. Thank you for your love of your art.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
