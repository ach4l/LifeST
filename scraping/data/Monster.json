They become so isolated that it just keeps growing and they're too scared to tell anyone because they think they'd be labeled as a freak so they try to be normal and fake it  but they hated being 'a pretender' and having to act as someone so very different than what they truly are. They begin to think it's their fault. It seems like a horrible trait to them so they're afraid to show people the real, true, flawed but somehow perfect person they really are.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nWell, here's my opinion:\n\nEver since I could remember,\nEverything inside of me,\nJust wanted to fit in (Oh oh oh oh)\n\nIt is about a guy, who since he was a kid just does not fit in his society.

Also, as the people doesn't like my acne I neither, and it's so much to you when not even you like your face as for all the people keep saying the same thing.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nHere is my look on this, but I think this song can be understood in a number of ways.\n\r\nIt tells about this guy who just wants to fit in. In some way, he's different and if he showed his true colors, people wouldn't accept him. He has taken on a role, being someone he isn't. Now, he don't like this role, not at all. He sees himself as a monster, this new him being forced onto him. He wants to escape this new role, as he sees that it isn't him.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis song expresses what it feels like to be  \"awake\" in this world.  It explains what a person goes through inside when you \"wake up\" to the harsh reality that everything we were taught about life and what we know about ourselves, is a lie.  The person in the song understands that he isn't who he thought he was in life anymore, and he knows deep down that he's been living a lie his entire life.  He wanted to learn the truth at the moment, but he never asked for the burden that it carry's by knowing it.  He's is trying to fight the awakening process that one goes through when you learn who we are on the deepest level. He's trying to forget the things that he understands the most about himself, because it makes him feel disconnected from the rest of society.  He used to naturally just \"want\" to fit in, but the truth that he learned has awoken a side of him that can't live in the reality of the old person he used to be.  That side of him is the monster that wants to be set free, but he is scared to leg go of the old him, because of the way people might judge him.  He's not ready for the world to see who he truly is just yet, and the more he trys to hide it the more the monster inside of him wants to come out.  \n\nIts hard for people to learn about the truth and then just go about their lives like nothing ever happened.  Once you become spiritually awake, its hard to look at life from the same perspective that you used to.  Your soul wants to be set free at this point, and the more you keep it trapped inside, then the more it begs to come out.  Most people subconsciously keep that monster inside because they've never met that side of them yet.  But if when you are consciously aware of that monster inside of you, then its hard to fight it.  The key to letting that monster out is to let go of everything that limits you from expressing what your true beliefs are.  Accept losing everything you ever knew, and begin to grow into your true Divine self.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nThis song reminds me of Divergent, my opinion so if you don't agree I'm sorry but I just think the story and this song have a lot of similarities.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\ni m gonna agree with chainta, this song describe perfectly how you feel when your developping a mental disorder ( i feeled like that when i developed some psychosis)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nThe thing about songs is that people can relate to them with their different experiences. Some other people who have commented have suggested this song being related to people with mental disorders, which I find understandable. But as someone who has never experienced this, I cannot personally relate to this. \n\nMy interpretation is that this is about an internal conflict. I hope that you all feel that a need for belonging is inherent to all humans; humans are not solitary creatures. They build societies where they belong to, are conditioned to belong to that society, and if that fails, find a society in which they do belong. The conflict is between the need to belong and the need to be true to yourself. \n\nAs a child who has been rejected by society, or on a lower scale, by his/her peers; a child who does not fit in this society, and cannot move away, you'd want to change yourself. This works if you're close to what is expected of you... but if you're very different, it feels unnatural. You try and try, but the habits, the values, just don't settle. \n\nI keep on lying to myself, and to the rest of society, who am I really? I know that this is not who I am, but you don't. If I told you that this is not who I really am, would you not like me anymore? If you think the real me is (a dangerous person?), would you be scared? I feel like everyone around me is being true to themselves, and I'm the only one with the problem, that perhaps something is wrong with me. \n\nI only have a candle to guide me; in this dark place, I don't know which way to go. Should I find myself? Should I find my way out? I'm losing myself, I don't know who I really am. This lie that I've been acting out all this time, is growing stronger, that it's becoming the real me. I've turned into this lie... and I don't want to. \n\nCan I ever find the right thing to do? If I show you all who I really am, will you all hate me? Do I have to run and hide? I never said that I wanted this, I just wanted to be myself and fit in at the same time. But now there's a problem, and it won't leave me. \n\nWill you leave me if I tell you who I really am? Would you be scared of me if I'm not who you think I am?

Sometimes it hurts to hear the truth. If I'm comfortable around someone then I'm not afraid of saying my opinion, even if it's a strong opinion. I can sound very rude with what I say, which I assume is why I don't really have any friends. My mom keeps telling me to think twice before I speak, but what she doesn't seem to understand is that I do and I can't help it, the words just comes out. Before I meet some of my boyfriends friends or relatives, he always says \"be nice\". It's like he thinks that I am not capable of being nice to people.\n\nMy dad is a lot like me. Well, correction, I'm a lot like him. But he lives like 6h away from me, so I don't get to be with him so much. Last week I was, and It was amazing. I was finally with someone who actually understood me, and my way of thinking. Someone who understood that I didn't mean to be mean with what I said whenever I said something that might sound mean/rude. \n\nI feel like this song could be a little about that. Being yourself and wanting to fit in with other people (friends and family), feeling like everyone else is looking at you like you're the bad guy (the monster) because you tell the truth no matter how brutal it might be. Feeling like the fantasy life you have is way better then the life you actually have. \n\nSorry if it doesn't make much sense, I'm not so good with putting words together so they make sense.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nAnyone who's watched Fringe by J.J Abrams would totally understand this: Season six when Walter gets his brain tissue fixed and then wants to get it removed but no one is letting him, and he's slowly losing love for those around him.

He and Steve Leonard (\"Leopard\" as he's also known as) went to see this freak show where they saw this vampire. Steve noticed that he saw Larten in a book and wanted to become a vampire. Larten said that his blood was evil so he couldn't become a vampire. Darren then steals Madam Octa, Larten's pet spider who is poisonous. He shows Steve her, Steve freaks out and says \"You stole a vampire's spider? Do you know how much trouble you're in?\" Madam Octa then bites Steve and paralyzes him. Darren fears that he will be accused of murder and go to jail. His family rushes Steve to the hospital and his parents call Steve's mother. Larten finds that Darren has stolen his spider and comes for him. Larten promises to find an antidote for his spider's poison, and then Steve comes out of his coma. Larten then tells Darren that in order to save Steve's life, he would have to become a half-human, half-vampire creature. To do this, Darren fakes his \"death\" by having Larten break his neck and throw him out a window. Now, Darren isn't used to the idea of drinking human blood and thinks he's turning into a monster.

I've heard it 50+ times and never once did i actually look at them. I used to think that this song had only a little meaning and no story behind it, but reading the words i realized that this song did have a story. My Life Story. This is a mix of my personal meaning and a general one.\n\nEver since I could remember\nEverything inside of me\nJust wanted to fit in\n(I was always a weird kid, and if any of you have read my post on Odd One by Sick Puppies I think I make that pretty clear. But my point here is I spent a whole section of my early life trying to fit and be \"normal\" but it never worked.)\n\nI was never one for pretenders\nEverything I tried to be\nJust wouldn't settle in\n(I really think that most people miss interpreter these. The \"Pretenders\" isn't a Ex-Girlfriend, or fake friends. I think he's talking about himself. In that context the first line here is saying \"I don't like trying to be something that isn't me\" and the second is \"It just never feels right.\" The third is saying that 'whatever he's pretending the be' just doesn't and never has felt right. I used to know this feeling so well.)\n\nIf I told you what I was\nWould you turn your back on me?\nAnd if I seem dangerous\nWould you be scared?\n(This is him thinking about someone he either likes, wants to tell his secret, or just the first person who wants to know him. (Maybe he's really taking to said person but I doubt it from my personal experience.) He wants to knew if the person would want to be his friend if they knew all his secrets. He wants to tell them but is too worried they wouldn't want to know him anymore, so he just thinks about it. Trying to get the courage. I've both seen and done this before, and it saddens me to even think about.)\n\nI get the feeling just because\nEverything I touch isn't dark enough\nIf this problem lies in me\n(The first 2 lines are loose so I have no solid meaning. What is the \"Feeling\". The fear of rejection in the last four lines? The feeling of Rejection itself? Or is he referring to the next line/lines? The next line could be implying depression, or he ruins anything he tries? He could be saying he think that he's such a bad person that he? I really don't know. But the third is self explanatory, 'is he the problem?' But when added to the last two lines it is more 'I can't do anything right, am I the problem.\" Like I said though, No solid meaning.)\n\nI'm only a man with a candle to guide me\nI'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me\n(This is interesting, the first line is a feeling of unknown, 'what to do?', and 'I'm lost', but the second is a complete 180 on the whole song, saying \"I'll fight because that's not who I want to be.\" I think this is saying \"I don't know what to do but I want to change who I am.\")\n\nA monster, a monster\nI've turned into a monster\nA monster, a monster\nAnd it keeps getting stronger\n(This confirms the he at least thinks he's a bad person, but not why. Maybe he hates pretending to be someone he's not? Maybe he's so concerned that he's \"Dangerous\" be cause he has seriously hurt or killed somebody? But this could just be as simple as he's afraid he'll break a girls heart. This fact can be taking as you wish because their are no specifics. But why he thinks himself a bad person is what really makes the meaning of this song. And since you can decide that yourself this is really a 'Choose your own meaning' song. For me and my life, it's that I'm not good with people skills, and my compliments usually end up angering or confusing people. The one relationship I had failed because I can't say the right thing.)\n\nCan I clear my conscience,\nIf I'm different from the rest\nDo I have to run and hide?\n(This is straight forward. It melts down to, \"Can I be OK with myself without fitting in.\" I myself have forgive myself and stopped caring about other peoples opinions. I don't try to fit in. But for a long while I hated being different and avoided talking to anyone. I'd transferred school in their somewhere and didn't let myself make any friends for 2 whole months.)\n\nI never said that I want this\nThis burden came to me\nAnd it's made it's home inside\n(Once again, simple. \"I don't want this. I didn't ask for this. Now it's something I'll have to live with forever.\" Those are words I once used to describe my own problem. I like how the lack of details lets you make your own interpretations, but this one is better then the last because you can project yourself here and it won't change the meaning of the song. But that may not make sense to anyone expect me.)\n\nIf I told you what I was\nWould you turn your back on me?\nAnd if I seem dangerous\nWould you be scared?\nI get the feeling just because\nEverything I touch isn't dark enough\nIf this problem lies in me\n(This is just a repeat to emphasize that this song is about wanting to tell all this to someone, or maybe anyone. But I still think the true meaning is what you make of it.)\n\nI'm only a man with a chamber who's got me\nI'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me\n(This part sounds the same as the part with the candle but the first line has a mostly different meaning. Instead of \"I can't see\", this first line says \"I'm trapped.\" The second line doesn't change meanings. So it's saying \"I need to get out of this. I have to change.\")\n\nAnd the rest is all repeats to say something like \"This is who I am and I'm gonna change that.\"\n\nSo the abbreviated meanings are \"I never fit in. No matter how hard I tried. I always though it was my fault. I'm a horrible person. I hate myself. I found I have a problem. Can I live with that? What should I do? I want to change. Can you still love/be friends with me?\"\n\nSo with everything i have here. It's a person wanting to change themselves for someone(s) else, or trying to explain why they are who they are. \nBut for the 3rd time this song complete lack of detail makes it whatever you make it. It certainly sounds like someone with a mental disorder. But more emotional and mental then nitsemc's comment, and I really like the first sentence of crystallia's comment. But like BetterThanYuu said, \"The thing about songs is that people can relate to them with their different experiences.\" I find different meanings then the most of songmeanings.com, so maybe I'm just crazy or maybe \"A Monster\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nIt's about siris coming to terms with everything he did as Ausar the Vile\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_19": "\nIf you have NOT read all of the books in the maze runner series, do not read this.

A candle can only show you where you're going and the rest of the world is in the dark and you can't see it. Bad source of guidance. Secondly, a candle is made of wax and eventually the wax melts.

I think he's scared to be himself because everyone around him will hate him, and he also doesn't want to destroy anyone.
