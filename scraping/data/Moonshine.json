I love the way Bruno explores different chord combinations on this album and it differs so much from Doo Waps & Hooligans....much darker....much better in my opinion, not so melancholy, more aggressive...\r\nThis song is self explanatory too. It is that person that you are not dating, but you meet up with, a favorite one night stand maybe....where you have the electricity in the physical relationship...this person who is your personal drug. Its a good song - definitely another album favorite.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song is simply AMAZING!!! Am I the only one who thinks this song is maybe about addiction? As Moonshine is a very powerful type of drink. Mars uses words like \"chemicals\" and \"fire\" which could be associated to alcohol. To me it's about finding something that will take you away from the world (\"take us to the stars tonight\"). And the singer can't stop (\"I know I was with you last night but it seems like it's been so long\"). And it also defines him (\"Everybody knows I'm not myself when you're gone\"). I get that vibe from the song because even though the lyrics seem joyful, it's sung with sorrow. Maybe I'm over-analyzing this song but that's how I interpret it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nOh god this song... what in the world...so...fucking amazing\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis is by far my favorite song by Bruno Mars, I was hoping to find some more information of what this song means.
