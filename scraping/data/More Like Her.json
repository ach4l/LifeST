She believes if she had those qualities the wife has that he would have stayed.\r\n\"You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart, and then you realized you wanted what you had\"\r\nI think the man in this song played both sides of the fence. The other woman knowing about the wife, while the wife was unaware. When the guy gets caught he chose the woman he had been with all along. \r\n\"I should have held on to my pride, I should have never let you lie\" I think here she's saying that she should have believed in her intuition that he was lying about how his marriage really was and she let him fill her head with lies about a future together. \r\n\" forgiving you, she's stronger than I am.\" And  \"It's plain to see, desperation showed it's truth, you love her, she loves you with all she has\" when it came down to the affair and all the lies, she learns it was never a question of him leaving his wife because that was never his intention and the wife forgives him for the affair but the other woman can not get past what he's done to her.\n\r\nThat's how I see this song.

I have an outgoing personality, many friends, and believe that beauty is only skin deep... she is nothing like me, so maybe his desire was for something totally different.

The line \"You had it all for a pretty little while,\" also indicates that he was probably seeing both women at the same time, and \"I should have never let you lie,\" indicates to me that the other woman knew that the man was still with his girlfriend, she knew that he was lying, both to the girlfriend by seeing someone behind her back and probably to the other woman by telling her that he would eventually leave his girlfriend.\n\r\nHowever, I can see how the argument could be made that the man and his girlfriend were either broken up or on a break because of the the line \"Then you realized you wanted what you had,\" since \"had\" is in the past tense, but that entire part of the song is in the past tense, so it wouldn't have made sense to say \"Then you realized you wanted what you have.\"\n\r\nI still have a great deal of respect for Miranda Lambert as a strong woman and an artist, but I think that if this song was autobiographical, she was someone's \"other woman\" for a time.

So he decides he wants to end this relationship with this girl who he's had past with, and she obviously has deep feelings for and continue the one with his girlfriend.\n\r\nReally liking this guy she lets him just leave her and lets him continue to lie to his girlfriend about the entire situation.\n\r\nAnd as she looks back on it she wishes that she would've stood up for herself more and than begins to wonder if she was more like his girlfriend, if he would've chosen her instead.\n\r\nThis is how i see it and maybe it's because I was in a relationship JUST like this.

You had everything I wanted.\r\nAnd somehow you made me smile when I was sad - I felt bad about myself and got put down, but you made me feel pretty.\r\nYou took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I think you actually cared for a while.\r\nThen you realized you wanted what you had \u00e2\u0080\u0094 You realized you had what you wanted right there.\r\nI guess I should've been more like that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Yep.\n\r\nI should have held on to my pride \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I shouldn't have done everything he wanted me to do, and said yes when I didn't feel ready.\r\nI should have never let you lie \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I should have called you on your stupid lies, then maybe you would have seen that I'm smarter than you think.\r\nI guess you got what you deserved \u00e2\u0080\u0094 You've changed and I can see it. Somehow, she's made you a better person and you deserve her. :)\r\nI guess I should've been more like her\n\r\nForgiving you, she's stronger than I am\r\nYou don't look much like a man from where I'm at \u00e2\u0080\u0094 After all your sleeping around, she's forgiven you and decided to trust you.\r\nIt's plain to see desperation showed it's truth\r\nYou love her and she loves you with all she has \u00e2\u0080\u0094 You guys clearly love each other.\r\nI guess I should've been more like that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 But if I had, I wouldn't have learned what I did.

I've liked my best friend for years, but about 2 years ago exactly, I turned him down when he tried to take his chance with me. I turned him down because I was still really hurt from a past relationship. Eventually, he started dating one of my best friends. Well, until this year when I told him how I felt and he dumped her for me because he said he'd always liked me, too. Anyway, every relationship I'd been in had hurt me so much. They cheat on me. Dump me for no reason. Stupid stuff. And I'm completely different from my (ex)friend. When I'm angry, I let it all out and I don't hold back. He would hide things from me, but when I'd ask about it, he'd say I was paranoid and that I needed to trust him. I didn't. It's hard to trust someone when everyone else you've trusted has let you down. When he would say something that hurt me, I'd let it go. I loved him, and I didn't like to cause fights over stupid stuff, so when it hurt, I just brushed it off. She is nothing like that. When she's mad, she'll say her piece of mind, but then she can easily let go of it. I can't. When she was hurt, she wasn't afraid to tell him. I was. He took his chance on me. I was that girl he thought he could fix. But I was too much for him, I guess. He realized with her, it was easier. Now to the chorus part. I let him walk all over me. That is not me keeping my pride. He knew he could do whatever he wanted, knowing I wouldn't say anything about it. He lied about hanging out with his ex. He lied about where he was. And I let him. I knew what he was doing, but I \"loved\" him. He broke up with me, and within two weeks they were back together. For that, I think she's strong. Stupid, but strong. She loved him enough to take him back after what he and I put her through. I could never forgive him for that, and he looks like a complete jerk. He doesn't look like the man I knew anymore. He'll never look the same to me. But I keep thinking.... If I was more like her.. I'd still have him.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_34": "\nWhen Miranda and Blake first began to fall in love Blake was married.

You took the chance on a bruised and beaten heart.\")but she couldn't help but be jealous of everything this girlfriend was that she wasn't. \nSo the guy juggles them for a while, hence, \"you had it all for a pretty little while.\" But he ultimately chooses to stay with his girlfriend or she tells the girlfriend what's been going on and the girlfriend forgives him, and she is heart broken and angry, yet she still wishes that she could be passive, perfect and forgiving like the girlfriend, since that's obviously what the guy wanted her to be. \nThis song is so interesting-it's not meant to be sad because this guy cheated on his girlfriend or because the girl's point of view doesn't seem remorseful for helping him cheat. It's sad that she really fell for him, and is jealous of his girlfriend and wishes she could be more like her. It's also sad that the girlfriend forgives him.
