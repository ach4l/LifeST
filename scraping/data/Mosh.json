{"comment_0": "\nHawrtbrayker: Bush contributed $87 billion dollars and several hundred thousand US troops to Iraq, a country with no association to the groups that attacked our country, and he's the one that is the only person who is willing to do something about terrorism? That is a ridiculous statement. Bush has done more to keep Bin Laden alive than anyone else. If he had spent that money and used those troops in Afghanistan and Pakistan, we'd have Bin Laden already. But we don't. And we won't, for a long time. President Bush drove us into a ditch.

I agree with tarnok, here.  I just saw the video on the GNN website, it is a slick infusion of rhymes and animation but it only goes so far.  This imagery of young people donning black hoodies and rampaging a state building to sign up to vote is completely and wholly unrealistic.  Gore Vidal said it best, he voiced that Democrats and Republicans are really two wings of the same party.  If the above scenarios were realistic, every black-hooded person would write Eminem in on the ballot and neither candidate would be elected.  Even if you crowd up all the young people to vote in Eminem, you could never amass the popular voting power of their elders (parents and grandparents) because they outnumber my generation twofold.  Bush and Kerry would still win the presidency.  The ones who are truly in charge, the ones who are truly threatened, would make sure every bit zealotry that is taken as truth by the masses would be vanquished before its taken on as an axiom in the arena of common sense.  It's common sense that anybody who is elevated to a position of popularity will surely turn out like their successors.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely and with human nature being what it is (social for survival unless egged on into conflict), I guarantee you Eminem would make a fabulous addition to that long list of political failures much like Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Jesse Ventura, Harry Truman, Elizabeth I, etc.  I foresee Schwarzenegger and Affleck becoming additions to that list.\n\r\nThe point is this:  songs like this bring out false hope and this is another song that falls on that false hope list.  They are unrealistic and only for the moment.  They don't offer a method for curing human nature.  If you want a truthful song about politics, \"Won't Get Fooled Again\" by The Who is maybe the best example that comes to mind about the perpetual state of politics and human nature.  That's true mood music if you want my opinion on the subject.  Eminem's deceiving himself, there is no way around the power-hungry aspect of human nature.  I am liberal in my heart but I'm both a realist and a liberal in my head, I'm torn like that.  \n\r\nIf this essay is removed from the boards, I sincerely apologize for torquing anybody off but I think it had to be said.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nI am a big Eminem fan, but I am also voting for Bush.

Why must Bush force his religious belief upon the enire country? first off Bush believes that Sex Education should not teach of contraceptives because he believes its a Christians Duty to save themselves until marrige, but, hear me out, what about people who are not christian or are and just dont follow the religion so strictly and hey if a teens gonna have sex then THEY ARE GONNA HAVE SEX! and if they are only taught about Abstinence and they decide to have sex they wont no of contraceptives thus leading to outbreaks of many infectious sexually transmitted diseases plus unwanted pregnancies which leads to the next issue, Abortion, if bush bands abortion then there will be a lot of young mothers or mothers period that will be getting back alley abortions which will kill the mother.

He really can't be rapping against George Bush, and the whole black and white thing, because it's a fact that George Bush has many people in his office both black and white, and Kerry has none that I know of. Kerry bragged about being all for blacks and everything, but that wasn't until after someone pointed out he went to a black church, and than he was all for blacks, but I didn't see him having any in office.

A woman should have the choice whether or not to bear a child, plain and simple. Restricting her from doing so is taking away her freedom, plain and simple. Shove your religious jaunder right back down your throat, cause religion has nothing to do with this issue.

The ending was updated post-election and it shows the blackshirts of Eminem storming the Senate with peace signs and banners claiming bring the troops home.  I am sorry, but that is mob mentality simple and plain.  The cops would have opened fire on that group without provocation.  I remember a Simpsons episode where Homer got a daisy got shot into his head because he put in it into a cop's rifle.  Granted, all these people were unarmed in the video, it's amazing what adrenaline and bare hands can do to a few people.  There would be blood running through the streets of DC and I am sure the federal government would not take any of the blame for it.  If you live on a farm in the rocky hinterland known as north-central North Dakota, you will see it on TV, mourn for five seconds, and then go back to playing Sisyphus with a tractor and harrow.  My point here is that nobody gives a flying fuck about what Eminem has to say.  His prose and imagery give a false hope that can never happen.  Since 9/11, security in DC is so tight is could be compared to a nun front's entry.  There would be security boys called in from Quantico, Langley, and even the nearby armed forces bases outside the Beltway.  I like the idea of radicals blocking the Beltway and moving on DC but Tom Morello thought of it just five years ago and he could never muster anybody to make such a move.  Eminem might have a larger fanbase but they have minds of their own.  Considering the firepower just between the 50-mile mark and the center of DC, those hoodies would never make it past Front Royal, Virginia on I-66.  Eminem is a full-blown idealistic liar who probably has never used an ounce of logic in his entire discourse on American politics.  If you are going to march on DC and storm the senate, you better be armed to the teeth and beyond because the DCPD and the American military will destroy you and make it look like a cakewalk in Central Park.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_105": "\nI may have my beliefs now but they would change when I go into the military.

I very much enjoy political debate, but perhaps this is not the best place for it.

It's really disturbing how anyone that realises this and speaks it is branded \"anti-American\". Eminem clearly realises this and is attempting to target his audience; young voters, students and the black minorities. As we can see from the huge rise in voting in 2004 from these minorities, politically-inspired music does make an impact, and that includes Eminem.\n\r\nHave none of you pro-Bush people realised that never in modern history has a sane major recording artist released pro-establishment music? Music is a big medium for dissent, and Eminem is very much one of the more outspoken examples of this (though even I admit I'm not a huge Eminem fan, though he still has a lot of correct things to say).\n\r\nPeace.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_120": "\n\"Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war\r\nLet him impress daddy that way\"\n\r\nThats the best line ever, and it is very true, let that son-of-a-bitch that we call our president fight over in Iraq, so he can see what he has caused, how stupid it is to be fighting for Oil and Terrorism, you can win the War on Terror it is impossible.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_121": "\nspoken like a true liberal\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_122": "\nHeh, I was planning on reading all of these comments, but there are just way too many pointless ones.\n\r\nTo philly: I remember a story when I was a kid about a boy who was throwing starfish back into the ocean as the tide went back down.

The boy threw another starfish into the water and responded \"I made a difference for that one\". I hope this is self-explanatory.\n\r\nI thought the video was interesting, I liked the style. I didn't like how (because of the time it was released) it was basically another political commercial.

Logically speaking lets look at the people who are \"anti-Bush\" here they say Bush is killing people, innocent people are dying because of him blah blah blah then those same people are  USUALLYthe  ones who say support abortion, women should choose right?! Well in my opionion the people being killed in this war are not just some innocent people off the street who were ripped out of their synagogues and shot, they were people who agreed to fight for their leader and his opinions which America and any one loves freedom could look at and see that those opinions are very harmful and dictator like. And in my opinion babies who have not had the chance to use their natural right as a human being (LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) are innocent people being killed. No I am not totally against it for cases that are deemed neccessary to use abortion but as a method of birth control seems wrong to me. And another thing I would like to say (not as a fact but as observation I found ironical) John Kerry once mad a speech in an attempt to convice the people that he too found Christianity important (not to say he does not) but as a christian I found it sort of ironic that Kerry said his favorite Bible verse was John 16:3 (when he meant to say the well known verse of John 3:16) well for those of you who might have read the Bible or are chrisitians you too may find it interesting that John 16:3 says \"they will do sucht hings because they have not known the father or me\"....thought it was weird that the verse he refered to was that....again I'm not trying to PROVE any thing but as a Christian I thought it was interesting. But on topic, you fight for John Kerry and you stand up for  drug-addicted, public offender like Eminem (who is only in it for the money any ways becasue he knows he doesn't make a difference if he sang the song or not except he got a 2 digit raise) and I will stand up for what I believe..I guess we will find out who his right in the end, but for now be logical and \"open-minded\" (i mean that is  supposed to be a liberal thing any ways) accept what others are saying wether you LIKE it or not.

Although its not utterly difficult to make anti-bush lyrics..they probably come to most quite easily.  I've been reading all of your comments about war, relgion, aborition and gay marriage.  If you dont belive in an Abortion..dont have one!  I agree with those who say that one has no right to force their religious beliefs on others.  In my opinion evangelicals like Jerry Farwell are complete hypocrats anyhow because they act as if they follow the bible, but they're morbidly obese. Obviously they belive in selective sin.  You think Gay Marriage should be banned.  Well if it really affects you that much than DONT HAVE ONE.  I'm lucky to be in a school where I know a few homosexual couples and it opens you to different lifestyles and to say that they are grose is disgusting in itself.  They are still people and thats pure ignorance.  Also about the War in Iraq you think its solving for terrorism?  It's causing more terrorists to flow into the country so that is purely false.  Why are we spending our hard earned money on this war that should have never been fought.  If some people are so pro-life then why are they so pro-war.  We went into Iraq not even with a sufficient exit plan.  I think the best thing that kerry has said about the war is this \"what is the point of winning a war if you lose a peace\".  That is what we are doing.  Wake up and face reality with Bush in office their is a much greater threat against this country not only a threat of another massive terrorist attack, but a threat of the citizens of this country losing the rights that this country was suppose to stand for.  Also it doesn't matter whether you live in Canada or Europe what the president of america does affects the rest of the world largely.  Just because someone lives in another country doesn't mean that they don't know as much as americans do about our president.

Look at how other people live in this world and what they are going through, dont just sit on ur asses and beleive the fox 11 10 o clock news. My point is, Everyone has opinions, but learn the facts before u develop an opinion. Go on the interent and do such research. Ever wonder why we're really in IRAQ? If u still think we're liberating a country and ridding them of W.M.D's and of a tyrant then u are absolutley the stupidest person on earth. America could care fuckin less if a place is run by a dictator. The point is we are their for a different reason. Wars are not just started for no reason. They are entire reasons behind them.
