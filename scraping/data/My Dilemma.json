{"comment_0": "\nAll her songs are straight-forward and simple. \n\r\nFor this one, it's about having doubts (for lack of a better word) between leaving or going back with someone.\r\n After everything between her and this guy, even though they have a lot of problems that they need to work out, she keeps contemplating on if she should go back or not. Therefore, she's stuck with her personal dilemma where she can but can't live without this person and has to sing about it.\n\r\nFrom the first moment I heard this song, I instantly thought of Nick Jonas as her personal Dilemma.\n\r\n\"I heard the rumors but you won't come clean,\r\nI guess I'm hoping it's because of me.\"\r\nWe all know that a few months before she recored this, he had a \"fling\" with co-star Samantha Barks when in London. Nick never admitted dating her, and I'm pretty sure Selena did know about her since she went to visit him at one of his shows back last year.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
