{"comment_0": "\nMy interpretation of this song is it has to do with her ex boyfriend Jai Brooks.  They broke up, got back together, and were on and off.  Some of these lyrics support this too.  Although, I mainly think this song is about her grandfather passing.  It was a very emotional time for her and this song defines how close she was with him and that even though he is gone physically, he isn't mentally.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
