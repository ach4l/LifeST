But this is what his kinda party would be like? And where you can find him? \"o baby you can find me?\" I know its a obvious song but I thought I would put it on anyway :P x\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nMy interpretation of Jason Aldean's My Kinda Party is that he likes to get out of town and have a good time.  The line \"If you can be my tan- legged Juliet, I'll be your redneck Romeo.\" is an archetype that relates to Romeo and Juliet.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nGreat performer and classy guy went and met my buddy who played for UGA.\n\nBut I have to say UA has UGA beat I think, and Southern can compete with Alabama as far as females.\n\nNow culturally southern is basically the Alabama of Georgia. Athens has its own thing which is kind of influenced by Savannah.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
