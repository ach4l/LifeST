{"comment_0": "\nI wouldn't say it's a sad song. More of a proud song. His not sad that his getting old, but proud of himself and the way he accomplished his challenges throughout his life. He sums it up perfectly in the last verse. \"For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught.\" It's a lovely song, and a modest one as well. Doesn't it make you feel that when your older you want to look back on your life and say, \"I did it my way\" and then smile? If the answer is yes then I guess Old Blue Eyes has made you feel exactly what he wanted you to feel.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song is a perfect explanation of existentialism\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song will never get old!\r\nIt's a classic and always will be.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nPretty simple.

Motivational speakers etc, often use this song as an example to get their point across.  They seem to think it is a song about self-reliance and self-sufficiency; a sort of 'I can do it all on my own - I don't need any help'.  Either that, or they seem to think it's about refusing to humble yourself and accept guidance from a higher authority.  Well, there may be a small element of that in it, but I don't think that's what it's mainly about.  Paul Anka, a friend of Frank's, wrote the song, around 1969, and he wrote it with Frank in mind, for Frank to sing, as sort of an autobiographical piece.  So what's it REALLY about???  I think it's a defiant refusal on Frank's part to justify himself to the world, and in particular the press.  Many famous people appear to think they owe an explanation of themselves to the world, and in particular the news and media, and then, having courted the attention of the press, they end up regretting it.  Princess Diana was a classic example.  Frank never did this, despite massive questions remaining unanswered about his mafia associations.  In the late 1930s, Frank had begun working as a full time professional singer, but he couldn't get a decent break, and felt that certain people were opposing him.  So he went to his cousin, 'Lucky' Luciano, who ran the New York mob, and they did him a favour.  After that, coincidentally, Frank's career took off.  Frank's sordid mob connections remained in place for many years after that.  And that is why, if ever there was someone who owed it to the world to explain themselves, it was Frank.  But he never did.  So when Paul Anka/Frank Sinatra are saying, \"I did it my way\", what they're really saying, is that Frank broke from the norm as a notorious celebrity by resisting the pressure to justify himself and his associations.  If only the many famous people today who are pouring their hearts out in the gutter press could take a leaf out of his book.....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_41": "\nThe song is about not living a life that others tell you to live (traditional institutions like church, school, family), but to chose to have a choice in life. The high pitch of \"I did it my way\" expresses the culminating point of glory. Life on Earth includes both sorrow and joy, and the best we could choose is to craft our journey and to lean on the bright side and see the positive things. Of course the song touches on elements of spirituality and a lot more.
