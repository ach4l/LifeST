And to me, it has a huge message that the video definitely embodied. \n ----------------------------------\nThis is my take on the story the song tells:\n\nShe starts off having stars in her eyes for this rich and famous big shot guy who is taking here to parties and introducing her to this crazy luxurious lifestyle. He tells her to \"be cool\" and she's nervous because she's never been in this niche.\n\nIn the next verse, she gives an amazing metaphor for having sex. But this time, she says \"i'm already the coolest\" when he tells her to \"be cool\". she has figured out the lifestyle now and she has become a part of that world. now she isn't just asking to go to parties, she wants him to buy diamonds.\n\nIn the end of the song she has blended completely into this crazy lifestyle of guys, money, drugs, alcohol, fame, etc. She is no longer that naive girl that was first introduced at the beginning of the song. She has lost to herself to the fake world of \"fame\". She is the \"queen of Saigon\" or.. the queen of the fallen.\n\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nLana tells this story and then towards the end talks about it being a \"love story of the new age\". Like, this is what the world has come to... People are obsessed with pop culture and these \"celebrities\" and \"socialites\". This crazed world of the famous is glamorized and the people in the spotlight often forget what's real and in the end all they have done is ruined their own lives, just as the girl in the story did.\n\nMoney HAS become the anthem of success. They are considered one in the same in modern times.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nIt's Bugatti Veyron NOT Bacardi [?].

But because she is somewhat starved of it, she's resigned herself to staying in an extremely unhealthy relationship because of the money. I don't think she ever intended to be a gold-digger at all initially, which is emphasised in her monologue in the extended video for the song. That isn't included here, but at the end of it she repeatedly states \"I loved him. I love him.\" This is more evidence to suggest she was never in it for the money. I think this song has a very similar tone to Video Games actually, she's trying to convince herself he loves her like he should but isn't fooling anyone. There are very brief glimpses of her insecurity and desperation to be loved more than anything else, for example this is hinted at in the line \"I need somebody to hold me.\" But on the exterior, and for most of the song, she tries to stay \"cool\" and pretend that she only cares about the money. I definitely think there's more to it than her simply staying in a relationship for the riches.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nI think it's \"dark and lonely\" not \"god can only\".\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nIts about how the money equals power, and she wants to be loved by him, like how he loves money.

Not only that, but just like this idyllic kind of life. The image of a perfect family, a perfect life.  I agree with yhtrownu about the whole she wants to be his national anthem part because money is the anthem of success, so she wants to mean the world to him. But after seeing the music video, I kinda also concluded that it's not just about the excessive life really, she sees this man, and he is everything; fascinating, intelligent, charming. And it's not that he doesn't love her, but it's not exactly the healthiest relationship. She defers to him, he brings to her all this glamour. In the music video, she's a loving mother, but when she's not with her kids, you can see that she can sense that her life isn't all that it's cracked up to be, especially when she is singing \"Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me.\" and when she is saying \"he will do very well, I can tell, I can tell\" It's because she can acknowledge that this man is extraordinary. I also got the sense that, she feels that no matter how much this man may love her, or how glamorous their life is, he's always being held back from his full potential, not by her per se, but just in general. His heart isn't wholly in their relationship. And when she asks \"Want a quick, sick rampage?\" I feel like this means that their love, it's not really lasting or healthy, but it's explosive and energetic, and the kind of love that burns brighter than any flame but then burns out, and it burns both of them out, because its so all-consuming and glamorous. I really don't know what i'm talking about, because I haven't really pieced together what I think it REALLY means, but this is what I've gotten so far...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\nI thought the whole song was more of like a big poke at the way fame is publicized, and Lana stands as an image of this fame--in the song, of course.\n\nShe's running after this rich guy who she only loves for the money and fame, and you can kinda assume he probably just wants her for her looks, trying to keep her happy, (\"I asked, 'Can we party later on?' He says 'Yes'\")\n\nI don't know.

I think all the \"romantic\" lines are jaded, she's just telling him what he wants to hear to get what she wants.\n\nI love the transition from innocence to experience - from \"I don't know how to be cool\" to \"I'm already coolest.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nIt's: Dark and lonely I need somebody to hold me\nnot: God can only\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nA national anthem is a song of devotion to one's country, and I think she uses it as a metaphor to show her devotion to and love for this twisted man. But in general, as we all know, the song is about the rich, superficial lives of the upper class. Constantly through the song she refers to various places, objects, and concepts associated with the rich. Lana loves talking about the privileged, upper class in her music.\nI think the song is very sexual for a number of reasons: (1) Chanting \"Red, White, Blue, is in the sky. Summer's in the air, and, baby, heaven's in your eyes. I'm your national anthem\" seems very sexual, like an orgasm to me (think about it!); (2) \"Can't keep your pants on\" or \"Put your hands up\" or \"Give me a standing ovation\" (erection); (3) \"Standing over your body, hold you like a python\", which sounds like a penis to me, but also snakes are obviously very dangerous.

How fantastic the American dream is for those who succees and can go party all the time. \"Overdose and dyin' on our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage\" asks the question \"is this American dream actually healthy? Is it possible to love each other when all we dream of is economic success?\".\n\nThe fantastic and complex thing about this song is that it can also be interpreted in a personal/relationship way, if you take the words more literally and try not to read too much out of them.
