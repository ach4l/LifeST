It ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all that bright, but even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s subtle\".  That does not make sense.  Neon signs aren't really subtle, but if it wasn't bright, then it would be subtle, not even though or in spite of that fact.\n\nSeems like some lazy lyrics, w/ the writer trying to make the words fit and rhyme.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\ngreat song....its about someone depressed about a breakup and turning to alcohol to heal the paint....the neon light is the bar and taking shots and getting drunk, its pretty obvious.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nIt's an allusion to his divorce from Miranda Lambert.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nThe blonde at the bar is Gwen Stefani.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
