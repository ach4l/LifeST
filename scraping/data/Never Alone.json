{"comment_0": "\nTo me this song is about a someone facing death, trying to let his/her loved ones know that everything will be ok and that they are never alone and that they should be happy in their life. Possibly a mother talking to her child or children.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI love this song. I think it can have so many meanings to different people, depending on their circumstances. It could be religious, about a best friend, a loved one, a partner.. anything! I love it!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis is the best song for a mother to sing to a child. It talks of all the hope that as a parent you have for your children and that when it is time for them in leave the nest you will always be with them.  Even when you die.  I sing this song to my daughter all of the time I have since the day that she was born.   \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
