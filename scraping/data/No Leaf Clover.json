{"comment_0": "\nThe song starts out massive, sounding like something big is about to happen. It then lowers, almost as if its sneaking up but then BAM. It's there.\n\n\"And it feels right this time\nOn his crash course with the big time\"\n\nHe's basically saying that he feels good that his time to be \"big\" has arrived. Yo\nu feel his anticipation in the rhythm.\n\n\"Pay no mind to the distant thunder\nNew day fills his head with wonder, boy\"\n\nHe chooses not to focus on the risks of his decision because its distant. Instead ponders the rewards the new day is going to give him.\n\n\"Says it feels right this time\nTurned it 'round and found the right line\"\n\nHe's assuring himself that his time to be \"big\" has come. He's glad he turned his life around, and he found the \"right line\".\n\n\"\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood day to be alive, sir\nGood day to be alive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says\"\n\nHis excitement and assurance is palpable.\n\n\"Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel\nWas just a freight train coming your way\"\n\nTunnels are like a shortcut, so instead of working hard to climb over the hill, he decided to take the shortcut and go through it. The light at the end of his tunnel wasn't the beginning of a new better life, but that of a train. The train was the risk he chose to ignore.\nThe second time this verse is repeated, the beat picks up, and he's realizing that his decision wasn't well thought out.\n\n\"Don't it feel right like this?\nAll the pieces fall to his wish\"\n\nHe comes to the realization that this was what he was asking for. He hadn't thought it through. Any shortcuts to something this big aren't going to come without risk. Everything had gone down to this moment, and now he has nothing.\n\n\"\u00e2\u0080\u009cSucker for that quick reward, boy\nSucker for that quick reward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they say\"\n\nOther people ridicule him for not thinking.\n\n\"Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel\nWas just a freight train coming your way\nThen it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel\nWas just a freight train coming your way\nIt's coming your way\"\n\nHe knows its going to hit him, and hard.\n\n\"Then it comes to be\nThen it comes to be\"\n\nIt's happening. He losses everything.\n\nThis song is about knowing what your getting into. Any shortcut to a rich life comes with big risks. You have to think things through before you delve into them, otherwise it will come back to bite you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI would not say \"unexpected\".

Verses\n\r\nNote the point of view changes in the verses, as well as the progression,\n\r\nVerse 1 being from the more dominant of the 3(?) characters, as seen in using the the word \"boy\". also this voice seems somewhat jovial like someone seedy yet somewhat imposing (like a boss) trying to convince the boy into doing a job for him.\n\r\nVerse 2 is from the point of view of the \"boy\" agreeing to do whatever job this guy has for him, he is seen being less significant or dominant compared to the other character through refering to the other character as \"sir\".\n\r\nVerse 3-\"dont it feel right like this\" is in the view of the crowd or watchers or whatever, as denoted by the personal pronoun \"they\". they are talking about the boy commenting that hes trying to achieve somthing far too quickly, \"sucker for that quick reward\". however for the boy, everything seems to be going right, \"all the pieces fall to his wish\", this verse shows foreshadowing to what is going to be the downfall of this boy\n\n\r\n2. Chorus\r\nI see \"light at the the end of your tunnel\" reffering to the one big reason to be doing what your doing, such as charity workers who work to help people, the helping being their light. or the money at the end of the day for the worker. \n\r\nThe frieght train could either be the realisation (internal) or the actuality (external) of something going wrong in the boy's big plan, that completly devastates him. There is an interesting (and almost ironic) link between a frieght train being fast and unstopable and his \"soothing light\" being in the form of a *quick* reward.\n\r\n3. Futher analysis\n\r\nIn Classical Greece, it was thought that all heros had a fatal flaw that would bring their downfall.\r\n- Oedipus' urge to find the truth caused him to unknowingly kill his biological father and marry his mother and futher-more that same urge led him to discoverthe truth and for that his gouged out his eyes.\r\n-Jason's lack of concern for women led to his downbringing when his ex-wife killed his children and wife.\r\nHow does this rambling in ancient greece fit in to this story? what we witness is a very similar thing, our tragic hero (the boy) is brought down by his own fatal flaw, that being the urge to make a quick buck.\n\r\nOne could argue that it is not the boy's fault but the seedy character from verse one. To those people i ask this: Would the boy still have agreed with Mr Verse 1 if the opportunity of the quick reward wasn't there?\r\nProbably not.\n\r\n4. My message.\n\r\nChances are alot of you are thinking i may have looked too deep into this one. truth is i might have, when i started this, i just let my fingers do the walking and let myself get carried away.

But in the long run it hasn't been the great ride the band anticipated,.it's been somewhat of a train wreck heading their way. Arena Rocks fame is fleeting like the pop fans that follow it and the pay packet it brings. That train wreck at the end of the tunnel is the bands reputation to the fans that respected them the most....the metal heads. That is the thing that would sting the worst, the fans that thought you were amazing before your fame and fortune, they now see you as a joke. \n\nBut it all comes out in the wash....In the end life is a series of tunnels and Metallica have since tried hard to get back to the metal scene and their original roots. Their original fans have returned and welcome them back with open arms while keeping a handful of pop rock fans.

It \"feels right this time,\" he thinks (implying that he's endured failures in his past); it's a \"good day to be alive.\" However, he soon realizes that in acting carelessly and ignoring warning signs, he has set himself up for pain and failure, and other people are judging him for it. Perhaps they're his family and friends, or perhaps they're people who took advantage of his impetuousness.\n\nHe was so happy, believing that he'd finally realized his dream (\"the soothing light\"), but instead he finds himself crushed by defeat of his own making.
