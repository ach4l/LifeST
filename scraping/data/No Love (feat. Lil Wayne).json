Amazing song, amazing album.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song, is EPIC on so many levels.\n\r\nFirst and foremost, I definitely think this song is a testament to Eminem's perseverance in the game. He has pushed his skills to a new dimension and timezone, surpassing Jay-Z and Nas (yet i feel, nas is still lyrically up there) easily. I'm not going to compare Pac or Biggie, cuz they have passed away...but in terms of rapid delivery, with lyrical creativity, EM easily pushes Twista 3x.\n\r\nHe changes up the tempo of his delivery to rhythmically create vocals that are instrumental on their own.\n\r\nThe only thing i found a little odd was his use of the word, \"fellow\" because i feel that word is dated, but when he rhymed it with \"You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow\", it totally is acceptable.\n\r\nThere has been some words, floating on the internet, that EM, was a bit ticked that Lil Wayne, and Kayne were getting attention, when he clearly felt that they --- for the most part were a bit over-rated.\n\r\nWell...you know how that saying goes. Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer?\r\nThat's what Eminem did. He did an Encore of Drake's Forever, and forever put lil wayne to shame, while grabbing the mic from Kayne, and sent him home, without a pen to his pad---jaws wide open, gag ball and all. Kayne is a plucked chicken.\n\r\nIn stead of stooping to Pac and Biggies level, Jay-z's and Nas's rivalry, and 50's and The Game's kiddy fest....\n\r\nEM, takes his adversaries, raps with them, and puts them to SHAME!\n\r\nSeriously, i think lil wayne is a joker, and needs to re-evaluate his style. It was cool with the Carter III, because it was \"new/edgy\" and took the world by storm, but now its repetitive, banal, and done. Lil Wayne sounds like his talking, there is no real delivery...like his technique is Juvenile compared to Em's. When Wayne speeds up his vocal delivery, it sounds like the start of Em's part.\n\r\nI love the way Em rips on Kanye, i'm sure Taylor Swift is gonna be bumping this tune in whatever car she drives.\n\r\nWhat i want? I want EM and NAS, to collaborate, and have DRE produce that shit. That's what i want to see...Not Wayne and Kanye, they both wanksta's.\n\r\nDrake, has some potential, but lyrically his subject work is cliche. 40, is a good producer for him...i feel drake can easily eclipse Wayne and Kayne, but has miles before he can touch Nas, Jay, biggie, Pac, or EM.\n\r\nEM IS ON TOP...and in the books forever. \n\r\nTOO $HORT should start taking notes.\n\n\r\nPeace out!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nWhy wouldn't you want to compare Eminem, Pac, and Biggie...Here I will do it for you...Biggie is garbage and the absolute biggest piece of shit to ever get a record deal...So Eminem wins that one...2Pac is a lyrically god as Eminem...So this is where the comparison gets good, both rapped about real life...2Pac was the first of is kind, and you clearly see the influence of Pac in Eminem...We have no idea how long Pac's career would of lasted because he died young...So, we can't really continue or know for sure is better, but this is what I will say...Eminem just turned 37, which by that time most artists are retired unless they are country, and nobody likes that shit anyway, so forget about that...Eminem just released what is perhaps the greatest album of all time from any genre...Every song could easily be a number 1 single...He already has 3 songs from the album to reach number 1...If he has his next single hit number one it will tie the most singles to hit number 1 from one in history, right behind michael jacksons thriller...So Eminem may not only be the best rapper of all time...Perhaps the greatest artist of all time, the man is legend in has own right, and deserves the credibility that people get... \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI got chills the first time I heard this, knowing that Eminem is back.

Instead of sounding as though these two were out with something to prove (that Wayne could create a rock album & that Eminem wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t washed up); instead the two are saturated with confidence and feel as though these previous haters have already been proved wrong. The production of \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo Love\u00e2\u0080\u009d is solid (an interesting \u00e2\u0080\u009cemo\u00e2\u0080\u009d sample, props to the creativity of Just Blaze) and Wayne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s background screams sounds as though it was influenced by Drake, Wayne & Em\u00e2\u0080\u0099s live performance at the Grammy Awards where Wayne acted as Em\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hype man during Em\u00e2\u0080\u0099s verse. In my opinion, Lil Wayne is essentially bowing down to Eminem (at least for this song) and his lyrical talents. Ironically, I feel as though Em\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more abstract lyrics of songs such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cWon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Back Down\u00e2\u0080\u009d are influenced by Tha Carter III.\n\r\nOn another note, with regards to the Kanye lines:\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMan get these whack cocksuckers off stage.\r\nWhere the fuck is Kanye when you need him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nEminem is referencing Kanye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s VMA mic\u00e2\u0080\u0099 snatch from Taylor Swift. Em slips in a pop culture reference that he is famous for \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he even adds in the hilarious \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099mma let you finish in a minute\u00e2\u0080\u009d quote. In the past Eminem has stated he believed Lil Wayne to be over-hyped but after listening to his a few of his albums, came to respect \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Martian.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Same with Kanye, with his preppy background and commercial competition with 50 Cent (Graduation vs. Curtis), Eminem probably thought about starting something back in the day when he was out of the game (at least as much as he had ever been since \u00e2\u0080\u009998).\r\nHowever, by this point in the album, Eminem has made it clear that he now respects Kanye & Wayne (see Talkin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 2 Myself) and these lines are a clever plea for someone such as Kanye to come back into the spotlight and replace these \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhack\u00e2\u0080\u009d less-talented rappers who are dominating the radio waves. \n\r\nOne last interesting aside, the lyrics \u00e2\u0080\u009crock fellow\u00e2\u0080\u009d sound an awful a lot like Roc-a-fella\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\r\nThis track is probably not the best on Recovery (I love Em\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tribute to Proof in \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Never Over\u00e2\u0080\u009d), but is definitely the most ambitious. Congratulations to Eminem on the comeback. I will be purchasing a copy of the LP on the day of its release to further support this recovery. \n\n\n", "comment_12": "\nthis song is great. em's verse is almost a diss of lil wayne who is on the same fucking TRACK... jesus man\n\n\n", "comment_13": "\nSick ass song!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\ni think wayne makes the song go from a 10 to a 9, anyone agree?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\nLil wayne has no delivery he just talks as for em fucking brutal. best rapper ever\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nI love the wit in this song, the rhymes, the similies and metaphors.  \r\nAnd just like in \"Forever\", eminem is the BEST PART of the song. \r\nHa, as usual. \n\n\n", "comment_17": "\ncompletely amazing. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nlil wayne,,,,, what a joke,,, drop the world, no love... eminem blows him out da water in both songs.... all i really gotta say is wayne trying to start a fight that JUVENILE is gonna finish....
