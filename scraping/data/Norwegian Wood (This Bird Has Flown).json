{"comment_0": "\nThe meaning of this song is explained. It is credited to Lennon/McCartney although it seems Lennon wrote most lyrics.\n\n\r\n\"I came in and he had this first stanza, which was brilliant: 'I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.' That was all he had, no title, no nothing. I said, 'Oh yes, well, ha, we're there.' And it wrote itself. Once you've got the great idea, they do tend to write themselves, providing you know how to write songs. So I picked it up at the second verse, it's a story. It's him trying to pull a bird, it was about an affair. John told Playboy that he hadn't the faintest idea where the title came from but I do. Peter Asher had his room done out in wood, a lot of people were decorating their places in wood. Norwegian wood. It was pine really, cheap pine. But it's not as good a title, Cheap Pine, baby...\r\nSo she makes him sleep in the bath and then finally in the last verse I had this idea to set the Norwegian wood on fire as revenge, so we did it very tongue in cheek. She led him on, then said, 'You'd better sleep in the bath'. In our world the guy had to have some sort of revenge. It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn't the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn't, it meant I burned the fucking place down as an act of revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental.\"\r\nPaul McCartney\r\nMany Years From Now, Barry Miles\n\n\r\nNorwegian Wood is a fake wood that was used to make cheap furniture. Lennon knew people who were using it in their homes and thought it would make a good title.\r\nThere are not many lyrics in this song, but they tell the story of a man who gets invited to a girl's house. When she won't let him into her bed, he sleeps in the tub. When she leaves the next morning, he sets the place on fire. It was one of the first songs Lennon wrote that told a complete story.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nREPORTER: \tI'd like to direct this question to messrs. Lennon and McCartney.

It burns quickly. Paul says it was his idea to burn the place down in the song. John says there was no one woman he was thinking about when he wrote this song, but that he was having so many affairs at the time, he wrote it in such a way as to keep his first wife Cynthia from getting suspicious. It has also been suggested that the woman in the song was the actress, Natalie Wood. As an actress, she would need to get up early to be on the movie set. John did meet a number of starlets in Hollywood during their tours, including Jayne Mansfield, but Natalie Wood has never been documented. With John's love for word play, it's plausible he would change \"Natalie\" to \"Norwegian\", but I doubt this.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nthis song is so vague because john was having an affair, but since he was married to cynthia at the time, he didnt want her to know.  the sitar is the best part of the song...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis is a clever little song about revenge, which seems odd for the Beatles, but the sly twist makes it more humorous than cruel.  He sets up by saying he once 'had' a girl, meaning he had her where he wanted her, or so he thought.  In fact, it was she who 'had' him, as in yanked his chain.  She made him think he was going to get lucky, but all she really wanted was his company for a few hours.  \n\nSo, the girl invites him to her place, and he is expecting to get it on with her.  Instead she prattles on and on until 2 AM, talking about irrelevant things and trying to impress him: \"Look at this place, it's made of Norwegian wood.  Isn't it good?\"  So he's been waiting all this time for her to put out, but she instead decides it's time for bed because she has to get up early.  She does not invite him to sleep with her (thereby the song hints that they didn't do what he was there expecting to do--have sex); annoyed, he goes off to sleep in the tub, which is no doubt very uncomfortable.  \n\nWhen he wakes she's gone; she didn't even have the decency to wake him up and say goodbye.  So what does he do?  Burns down her precious Norwegian wood house. :-)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nReading all of these postings I became fascinated - OK obsessed -with all of the interpretations of this song.  I thought I knew what the song was about, but apparently not.  I decided to send out a poll to family and friends (ages 28 through 60) to get their opinions. I asked them 3 questions:\r\n1) Was one person seducing the other, and if so which one?\r\n2) Did they have sex>\r\n3)What does \u00e2\u0080\u009cNorwegian wood\u00e2\u0080\u009d refer to, and how does it relate to the fire at the end?\n\r\nSuprisingly enough - with the 15 responses I got as many - maybe more - than are found here.\r\n1) 7 people thought that she was seducing him, 1 thought he was seducing her, the remainder thought it was either mutual or weren't sure.\r\n2)10 thought they did not have sex, while 5 thought they did.\r\n3) 3 people thought he burned furniture in the fireplace, 2 people thought he was smoking marijuana, 2 people though he burned the place down, 4 people thought that that Norwegian wood referred to logs in the fireplace, and 2 people thought the setting was Norway and that it referred to the forest outside.\n\r\nDespite the relatively few answers to these questions, it resulted in a myriad of combinations, so only a few peoples' interpretations of the song coincided : e.g. she seduced him, they had sex and he threw a table in the fire vs. she seduced him, they didn't have sex and he lit the fire in the morning, vs.....\r\nAnd interesting point, a couple reserached the song, were surprised by the arson theory, and flat out rejected it. \n\r\nAs for my own interpretation - - it was similar to azaud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  I also feel compelled to discount the arson theories based on the meoldic nature of the tune and the tone of the lyrics. \n\r\nGreat discussion on everybody's part.  \n\n\n", "comment_6": "\nThis song reminds me of a British movie that came out in the eighties about\r\nan English college exchange student who goes to Paris,where she loses her virginity\r\nto a Norwegian boy also a student-hence-\"Noerwegian wood\".

Drugs? Lesbian? Oral sex? Arson? Come on! You're reading WAY too much into this song! Here's what it means:\r\nThe narrator goes to the girl's apartment, which is furnished with Norwegian furniture (later made famous by brands such as Ikea). This furniture showed that she was cool and modern  -- \"hip.\" The \"she once had me\" line simply means that in the end she fooled him. The fact that there wasn't a chair simply means that the apartment was sparsely furnished -- not unusual in the style of a young, student-age single woman. He goes home with her, hoping for some physical interaction, and bides his time as they drink wine. But alas, she has only been teasing him, and goes off the bed  by herself after getting his hopes up by saying, \"it's time for bed.\" She leaves him to fend for himself as far as sleeping arrangements are concerned, so he crawls off (probably half-drunk) into the bathroom -- sleeping on the floor or in the tub, I presume. The next morning he wakes up after she has gone off to work, and is angry that she led him on, that she played mind games with him, so he lights a fire (in the fireplace, I assume) using some of her nice Norwegian furniture for firewood. This gives him a little sick pleasure as a sort of revenge for her teasing him -- exactly the sort of thing that an acerbic, cynical John Lennon would do, or would think of doing.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nof course, number one lesson from this song: BUY A SITAR\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nWow. I would have thought that for a song by the Beatles SOMEBODY would have gotten it right by now.  They broke up in something like 1977, right?  Anyhoot here is my take.  \"surreal\" came closest in my opinion, somewhat informed by talking with songwriters and pro musicians.  No the guy did not burn the effing house down or go around breaking up the furniture and no, nobody got stoned and no its not a secretive coded message about somebody's marriage at the time.  \n\r\nIt's just a song, people. Its a simple song, which works because simplicity is what Lennon and McCartney were good at.  Its about a fairly common for the '70s scenario that involves a sexless would-have-been \"one-nighter\". If you went to the College of William and Mary you know this sort of thing all too well. \n\r\nThe girl toys with the guy, who probably was a bit horny, and he really does go off to sleep in a cold, comfortless place, and he wakes up alone and full of bitterness at the lack of resolution of any kind; she does not explain, she just leaves. She got her own emotional payoff, so she is done with him already. \n\r\nThe \"fire\" referenced is simply the nature of the guy's feelings relating to anger and frustration. So he makes a fire in the fireplace, probably with peat or coal, to warm himself; not exactly the best conclusion to a failed night of thwarted passion.  The last line is bitter, very bitter, sarcasm with a slight reference to the cheap faux oak furnishings lacking sincerity or depth. Not much to read into it.   There is nothing in the musical progression to suggest anything so violent as breaking up the furniture or burning the house down; the Beatles were not in that sort of space in the late 1960's and neither was pop. Its just a simple song about sexual and emotional and spiritual frustration that goes unrelieved.  \n\n\n\n", "comment_13": "\nIkea?

The bit about the chair implies that she has no need for him, that he doesn't really have a place in her life.

When I hear the words to this song, I simply imagine the simple but powerful feelings that correspond to each image that's put forth.  The entire song is sung in a kind of flippant and melancholy tone.  This lends emotion to the events taking place and transports me every time to being in the shoes of the man who is doing the narrating.  The emotions that I get are mostly are excitement at getting some tail, but at the same time a feeling of disgust and emptiness that they really don't mean anything to each other at all.  Also, I have the distinct feeling that I'm being used by the chic in the song, and that kind of pisses me off.  It's very significant that once he fucks her he crawls out of the bed and goes to sleep in the bathtub.  He wants to separate himself from the event after it's over, because he's not comfortable with it and really can't stand the chic because she's annoying and presumptious.  \"If anybody's going to be doing the using, it's me,\" he thinks.  I mean, accurately creating this feeling through song is a tremendous accomplishment, regardless of the trivia about who he was banging or which words he was allowed to use or not in conveying it.

So he casually sit down on the rug, probably leaned back and sat drinking wine waiting until the appropriate moment to make the move to get her into bed for sex. (Sitting on the floor/rug back in the 1960's and 1970's was common amongst friends. Every weekend in the '70's I'd party with my musician friends and we'd all sit cross-legged on the floor with our guitars).\n\r\nAbout sleeping in the bath. One of two things. It could be that he was drunk and the bathtub was a handy place to crawl off to and be cool in (so the 'hots' following a night of drinking weren't so bad) or he wants to show that he was deeply disappointed in how the night turned out and that the bath represented an empty lonely cold place to have to be.\n\r\n\"So, I light up a fire....\" \r\nOK...confession time. I was 9 years old when the Beatles were on Ed Sullivan in 1964. STOP SNICKERING :)    In my childish naivity I first thought that he simply built a fire in the fireplace to warm up in the cold morning (for some reason I pictured her place as a log cabin type place made out of logs). But now I really do think that he either burnt up what little furniture she had or set fire to the whole place.\n\r\nFirst he admires the Norwegian wood as something nice to look at, when he still thinks that he has a chance with her. But in the morning faced with disappointment he now sees the wood in it's beauty as it burns.\n\r\nOh, BTW. I'm not discounting the thought that Norwegian Wood is a type of marijuana. But from experience. Back then we didn't that many choices as to types of marijuana. We were darned lucky if a bit of Acapulco Gold came our way. Next on the list was just some anonymous stuff from Mexico. But mostly, it was locally grown yucky stuff without much bang and hot as a blowtorch. But the Beatles being who they were probably could get some more exotic weed than some poor Midwestern teens could !\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_101": "\ni heard somewhere they ripped off the melody from a bob dylan song\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_102": "\nI once heard a John Lennon interview and he said that this song was definately about pot....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_103": "\nI liked that pun \"Knowing she would = Norwegien Wood.\" It's interesting that sum forces WOOD goe for fyr rather than lightning.

Having flown, it has seen from great heights the awe-inspiring landscapes and natural beauties of this world--all from a seemingly safe and isolated position. But upon landing, the bird terminates its existence under the weight of a gravitational force it can no longer defy; its essence disintegrating into the organic elements that initially composed it.

I have to say that I never thought the \"I lit the fire\" line implies the singer literally set a fire. To me this song goes like this: The singer (John, who admitted to feeling very insecure and lost at this time in the Beatles career) goes home with the girl, assuming there will be sex. When she alludes to having to work in the morning and laughs, that is a clear signal that there will be no sex. My interpretation of the norwegian wood phrase is that the singer has a case of \"blue balls\", Norway being a cold country and wood a reference to an erection. The \"I lit the fire\" line to me either means that he masturbates to relieve his \"norwegian wood\", or that he is blaming himself for getting aroused over a girl who didn't want him.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_125": "\nI've always felt that the song revolves around a one-night encounter (\"she showed me her room\" and \"i look around and I noticed....\" both imply that the singer in unfamiliar with her apartment).\n\r\nBut ultimately I believe the song revolves around the mind games the lady is playing with the singer. \r\n*\"or should I say she once had me\"--suggests to me that the singer realied after-the-fact that the lady truly had the psychological upper-hand the entire encounter\r\n*The lady invites the singer to sit anywhere, even though there is nowhere to actually sit.\r\n*They drink wine and talk until 2am, certainly suggestive of leading up to sex\r\n*\"she told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh\"--though it's not found in the lyrics, this particular lines seems to be in responce to the singer's suggesting/implication of sex. The \"laugh\"ing part was probably even more demoralizing for our assuming singer.\r\n*\"I was alone, this bird had flown\"--the singer's ultimate realization of failure/isolation/rejection\n\r\nI am also a VERY FIRM believer that our singer did indeed light a fire lady's apartment as his ultimate revenge for the lady leading him on the entire previous night. The first time the line \"Isn't it good, Norweigen Wood\" is sung, I believe it's from the lady's perspective. She is showing the singer around her apartment and is boasting about her Norweigen Wood furniture, so in this context the lyrical line seems almost boastful and condescending (which adheres to my \"mind games\" theory\". However, the second time to lyric is sung (the final line), it's from the singer's perspective. He woke up alone and humiliated and decided to burn down her cherished furniture and ironically repeats the line \"isn't it good, norweigen wood\", in an entirely different and chilling context. It's as though the singer feels very emotionally hurt by the lady and realized that she manipulated him the only night, so he some-what childishly burns her furniture on his way out the door.\n\r\nThe song is truly amazing.

This is about a homosexual encounter. Lennon was famous for his word play and double meanings, and his will to shock. The banality of this encounter in a heterosexual sense is hardly something that would inspire him to write a song (I mean how many more exciting sexual encounters did The Beatles have in the glory days!!!!). As a homosexual encounter however the lyrics take on a whole new meaning. \r\nI once had a girl, or should I say she once had me - a reference to who is giving and who is getting!\r\nNorwegian Wood also is rather more pornographic than it initially seems, as is the \"she told me to sit anywhere, so I looked around and I noticed there wasnt a chair\" just Norwegian Wood to sit on apparently. Sitting on a rug, is a clear reference to pubic hair.\r\nRemember that Beatles manager Brian Epstein was actively involved in gay London at the time, and as a close friend of Lennon it shouldnt be surprising that he would write about these kinds of things in his songs. Similar references appear in other songs, eg I am the Walrus \"boy youve been a naughty girl you let your knickers down\", knickers being gay slang for a partner or boyfriend at that time.

The first sentence implies how they had interest in each other, but his was definitely more. She revealed a lot to him, including Norwegian wood. Norwegian wood is cheap wood, so right from the get-go it is revealed that whatever she felt for him was weaker than he presumed.\n\nShe had some interest in getting to know him, but it was not as much as he thought. However, he waited because she did offer him niceties. It's almost funny how relevant John was to the modern world and how people often stay up late talking and then simply go to bed like it was not a big deal. \n\nThe girl had other obligations the next day and thought it was all good fun that they had been talking. But the speaker was still willing to wait up for her and sacrifice his own priorities. He does not make a move on her (sexual or otherwise) because she has just wrecked their late-night conversation by saying how she has \"work\" the next day.\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning, she had moved on. The bird had flown and the speaker realizes he's too late (I say speaker out of respect but I have a feeling John was writing about himself). He's angry and lights a fire symbolically to the weak wood.\n\nIt astounds me how much pain and literary technique John uses in every song he writes.

But the song doesn't mention a fireplace and the thing in the song which was made of norwegian wood was her room. \"She showed me her room, wasn't it good, norwegian wood.\" So my guess was that he meant that he burned her room, which essentially meant burning the whole place down. That would turn the song into a sort of brief, simple, sing-songy snippet of prose that ends up packing quite a wallop which is a common sort of thing, and certainly seemed in character for the Beatles, so, that seemed like the mostly likely interpretation to me.\n\nBy the end it seemed that they didn't have sex, which made me question whether or not they were actually boyfriend and girlfriend, which cast doubt on my understanding of the first line. So it was a mystery to me what it meant until I read the explanation provided by Docent, on this page. The idea that \"had\" in \"I once had a girl\" referred to deceiving or tricking someone is pretty anathematic to me and would be another in a fairly long list of similar horrors that would cause me to be rather put off by likes of the Beatles, even if I enjoy their music. I would be virtually burned at the stake by a crowd of millions for admitting to such, but I've never been a conformist. \n\nBut docent's quotes don't actually explain what \"had\" meant. I think I'd prefer to think that it wasn't so much about deceiving or tricking as it was about simply being in a relationship. Maybe they hadn't had sex yet, but had been fairly clearly building up to it.\n\nThe song seems like a kind of morbidly fascinating comment on philandering. The picture I get is of a sincere fellow who is wandering a bit from his main squeeze because he fairly desperately needs more, emotionally and physically, than he's getting, and thinks maybe he's found it in this new person, but it turns out she was just intent upon punishing him for philandering. So he unleashes his completely overwhelming bitter wrath upon her for appointing herself judge and jury over him and making him think she liked him and wanted him when she really didn't.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_142": "\nwake up people!!  look at the country of norway on a map.\r\nI am sure john was using a hidden sexual meaning.\r\nnorwegian wood = a hard erect penis\r\nthis is not a joke\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_143": "\nwith respect to everyones personal interps, the songs about johns affair with yoko. it's got nothing to so with drugs or furniture.
