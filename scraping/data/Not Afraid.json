He struggled with drug addiction & has been able to overcome his disease.\n\r\nAt any rate, the lyrics are easy to understand to anyone in recovery as they are based on the 12 Step/AA/NA/etc views & slogans/sayings about recovery and our disease.\n\r\nHe is Not Afraid to take a stand and face his demons and the wreckage of his past.  For myself, I continued to use because of the guilt, shame and remorse of my actions the previous day(s), weeks, months and then years; so he is willing to face those things and recover from his addiction.

He is saying that he's coming back without worries of regression. He's also saying that if anyone else has the problems he had he knows what they are going through and he will lift them up. Eminem is saying that no matter how hard life gets you will have people to lift you up along the way and people have been down the road before you and you are able to come back from it because others were able to.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI'm wondering if anybody really knows what this song is about.  Some of it is just small talk but the overall message is about recovery from addiction.  In a 12 step program, our main goal is to recover & help others recover from addiction. That's why he says \"Everybody come take my hand, we'll walk this road together.\"  The whole \"not afraid to take a stand\"... in my opinion has to do with an addict's ego because when we let go of the drugs, one of the first things we have to deal with is our ego because we're always worried about what other people will think about us quitting drugs or what others will think about the fact that we even did drugs.  When he says, \"thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this f-ing black cloud still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons, these motherf-ers are doin' jumpin' jacks now!\"  A lot of times, in recovery we try to do things our own way & we think we can.. and most of us never really understand why we are so addicted, or why even when we have stopped doing drugs or alcohol for a long period of time, we are still an addict and/or alcoholic (this f-ing black cloud still follows me around)... so we have to always work against the disease to keep it at bay (but it's time to exercise these demons). The line, \"These motherf-ers are doin' jumpin' jacks now!\".. if you haven't been in recovery, you would never know what he's talking about. Addiction/alcoholism is a progressive disease whether you're using or not and they say the whole time you're clean, your addiction is still getting stronger, doing jumping jacks in the back of your mind.\r\nMy favorite verse of the whole song is the last one, where he says, \"Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub & lift the whole liquir counter up cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing & I'm not afraid...\"  He is saying that he is strong enough in his recovery to put himself in a tempting situation without giving in.

His explosive authenticity is what moves me to not just hearing the beats but listening to the words in the lyrics. There are metaphors that Eminem creatively uses are culturally relevant to his listeners. There is a clear cut and straight to the point that Eminem raps to not beat around the bush with admitting his responsibility in what he contributes to this world. Eminem realizes he plays a large part in life to his children, to his fans, and to this world. What Eminem knows is that at the lowest he could go, he was elevated back up by an impulse, a will, a release of fear, letting go of control, and remembering his capabilities, strengths and talents that are within him leading him to what he desires to become. \n\r\nWe can all ask ourselves who are we becoming by looking at where we are at in life. I think Eminem is inspirational and courageous and I appreciate his contributions to this world. \n\r\nOne last observation I had comes from my belief in God. I know God loves Enimem and has created his with a purpose and destiny. No matter who we are or what we are going through, God is with us and loves us non-stop. Nothing can separate us from God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love and who he has created us to be, which is inspirational, creative and motivated individuals.

Honestly, I feel it all depends on personal experiences. It could be about depression to one person, but addiction to another. These lyrics were probably meant to pertain to everyone and not just a recovering addict. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just my two cents.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_70": "\nin my opinion this is the best motivating song I have heard from the artist, everything he said on the song applies to me,  very uplifting, I have a YouTube  channel which I share on my site, every time I am down I play the song, thank you Eminem for making this uplifting song sir.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_71": "\npremise of I'm Not Afriad - by White Rapper Eminem. He being an American History X type of character in a ghetto bg, got onto the Black Man's stage and into the White Man's heart too. So he is talking aboot, \"hey fellow crackers, don't be racist.\"\n\n1.\nThen he begins with the para that talks about, i've been a racist, don't be one, not a good place to be for your own happiness, fuck what others think, when they look up or look down, others are stupid.\n\n2.\nDespite poverty and being a minority in a White Man's Game (Rap is the White Man's High Table in the Black World) he says, i may eat beans, and i maybe gassy and still i will sing/rap to you on this stage. You opera watchers, la di dah, who sit on the balconies and high seats. Now he is switching to the poor so-called white-trash (which is nothing but something bad white rich people refer to when they call out their own employees - other bad white but-poor people). He's the average officer employee made to work on holidays and does this all his life until he quits or dies. He spends too much on sex and escapism.\n\n3.\nNow in 3rd he is trying to establish himself as a righteous hero, which if we maintain suspension of disbelief, he does a nice job of executing, being teh ANgry White Rapper Guyyy. He says i'm big, ima help u little guiiiiii.\n\n4.\ndoes not compute...maybe was time bound to an earlier verzion\n\n5.\nrepeat 3.\n\n6.\nHe says then the poor white man ultimate either quits or dies working, or some that try trying, end up being violent racists in gangs and shits. And he says all that is nonsense, if you just focus on the wellbeing of your own self by being a proud father and taking care of your son or daughter\n\nside note >>> wew the world's first songmeanings.com entry for a rap song, that itself raps, ping fucking pong!\n\nSongwriters: Matthew Raymond Burnett / Jordan D. C. Evans / Marshall Bruce Mathers / Luis Edgardo Resto / Matthew Jehu Samuels\n\nIt's good that he writes some of his own songs.

I also think its his way of no longer allowing anyone or anything to have control over his life, his feelings or his decisions. He is standing his ground, he is no longer afraid. He doesn't care what anyone thinks and is going to follow his heart regardless of what anyone has to say about it. I think it is also his way of reaching out to people to let them know they are not alone in their struggles. I think it is  a message to stand up and fight when it seems the odds are against you. Instead of giving up when all seems lost, TAKE back the life that is yours and regain control.....I personally have demons I am fighting right now, and this song gets played on the daily. It is an inspiration to me, reminds me of how incredibly strong I am even when I feel defeated, and it is one of many songs that keeps me going. I also think that lyricists write their music a certain way, knowing that every listener will have a different perception of its meaning. I think that is something that makes music so incredible. One person can get something entirely different than someone else, its universal in a way.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_74": "\nHe still sounds like he has no balls, and that he has to try and make up for some deficit.

His dick is sufficiently sucked.\n\r\nWe all know you like it, but what's the song about (considering that's what this site is supposed to be fore)?  Did he kick just the pills?
