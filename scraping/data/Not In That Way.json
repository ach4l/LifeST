{"comment_0": "\nThis song has a clear meaning. It is about someone he loves but that person doesn't love him back in the way that Sam loves them :) \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nWe've all been there Sammy!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nMaybe this song holds a deeper meaning, like how much he is willing to give to this person he has such strong feelings for, all he can do is give himself entirely but yet still be denied. Depression, anxiety and just wanting to feel that void of being alone. Referring to the line in the song that says, \"you will never know that feeling\". \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
