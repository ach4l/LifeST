{"comment_0": "\nI read through some of the comments before writing my own opinion of the song's meaningful nature.  Some of them were useless and a whole lot'a babble, others were religiously based, which made me want to gague and roll on the floor, and occasionally some good points were mentioned.  My interpretation of the song will probably have the same reactions to the ones I'd seen above or worse of ones.  So, here I go, I'll try and summerize as best I can!\n\nNothing Else Matters-Metallica\n\nWhen I'd first heard this song I was stumped, I didn't know what they were talking about, how could such a melody have lyrics of such dark nature, well, this is how I percieve it after replaying it to the point of having 567 plays on my Itunes:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nSo close, no matter how far\nCouldn't be much more from the heart\nForever trusting who we are\nAnd nothing else matters\n\nComment: The narrator speaks of a first love, or maybe even a true love after searching many years for him/her (perhaps also a signifacant other).  In love we need to trust, and even more so in ourselves.  The narrator says that in love trust and being true to your heart is all that matters.\n\nNever opened myself this way\nLife is ours, we live it our way\nAll these words I don't just say\nAnd nothing else matters\n\nComment: The narrator is opening himself to him/her like a book, telling secrets and sharing things he/she'd of never imagined sharing.  He/she is having a spur of reality, rebellion even, deciding that their life is their own and that he/she is determined to live it how they want no matter what people say.  Being true to you is all that matters.\n\nTrust I seek and I find in you\nEvery day for us something new\nOpen mind for a different view\nAnd nothing else matters\n\nComment:  The narrator now is finding a sense of belonging and trust in their significant other, learning new things and keeping an open mind towards what's happening.  Being open and willing to change is all that matters.\n\nNever cared for what they do\nNever cared for what they know\nBut I know\n\nComment: The narrator is accusing people of not caring enough for their actions and shaming them for not using their knoweledge.  He says he knows, something of the reality.  Perhaps a break in the trust? \n\nNever opened myself this way\nLife is ours, we live it our way\nAll these words I don't just say\n\nTrust I seek and I find in you\nEvery day for us, something new\nOpen mind for a different view\nAnd nothing else matters\n\nComment: The narrator repeats himself, obviosuly destressed from some event, telling you that he/she needs to stay true to themselves and rebuild a trust.  Again, he/she says that trust and staying true is all that matters.\n\nNever cared for what they say\nNever cared for games they play\nNever cared for what they do\nNever cared for what they know\nAnd I know\n\nComment: Now we know there has been a break somewhere between then and now.  The narrator tells us that they don't care about their actions, that they're playing games and know it.  He/she might appear oblivious to what's going on, but he/she makes it clear that they KNOW what's happening, that they have and still do.\n\nSo close, no matter how far\nCouldn't be much more from the heart\nForever trusting who we are\nNo, nothing else matters\n\nComment: The song ends with a specific cluster of lyrics, saying that you need to trust in you and not others.  He/she says that no matter how far you are, or how close you are to love or something more than what you have, always stay close and true to you, that's all that matters.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAnyway, that's my disection of the song, and how I interpreted it so many times over.  Feel free to agree and disagree, but that's how I see it.  A song is a song and a song holds a meaning; how we as individuals take in that meaning is how we as individuals will learn to appreciate the song as a piece of art, and even at times, a part of us.  We relate and understand things differently, hope this helped!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis is a very special song to me. My mom tells me everytime she hears it that its going to be her funeral song. She tells me because the song means that no matter what happens in life, who you meet, the things you do...remember who you are. Dont let what people think about you and what they what you to be change you. always \"true in who you are\". The person you truly are.

But whatever you think of it, you've got to give them credit for expanding their horizons, as Metallica have done here. \r\nNot that it's too different, but it's definitely a change from their usual violent lyrics and heavier, louder music. And in my view it's an awesome song. Very good lyrics about a love song.\n\r\nSo close no matter how far\r\ncouldn't be much more from the heart\r\nforever trusting who we are\r\nand nothing else matters\n\r\nThis sounds like he loves someone dearly and while he doesn't have this person (presumably female), in his grasp yet, he knows that these 2 are very close and he's preparing to tell her something and show a side which he's never shown before, or tell something he's never said to anyone before.\n\r\nnever opened myself this way\r\nlife is ours, we live it our way\r\nall these words I don't just say\r\nand nothing else matters\n\r\nHe's said his say and that it comes from the heart, they are no lies.

It talks about stepping into the shoes of someone else and viewing any situation from that someone else's perspective, which radically changes our viewpoint and, if anything bothers you, like work related stress, brings you right down to earth when you think of lesser fortunate people, who might probably toil for the rest of their lives, and could never be able to, forget writing comments, even listening to Metallica.

You can tell this is really \"James' song\" because it's the only one I know of (owning every studio album) where he's the only one who plays a solo. I'm sure hardly anyone is paying attention to the drums on this one, but its one of the better lines lars has ever laid down as well. the alternation between snare and bass is awesome. This, orion, and to live is to die are the only three songs i listen to that provoke any emotion at all. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_277": "\nthe S&M version is even 10x better than the original\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_278": "\nA sweet piano rendition of this song, found on youtube.\n\r\nEnjoy\nyoutube.com/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_279": "\nThe Essence of our who we really are, TRUTH, is \"so close no matter how far.\"  Truth is the only thing that will never ever\r\nbetray you.

The trust is in you.\nEvery day for us something new = Life brings something new every day. It has its ups and downs. It's the same for everyone ! Don't let that bring you down.

Never care for what troubled people say or do, because so many people are troubled and blinded and reflect this on others. Self-reflection or starting to recognize your own imperfection can come to surface as a result of other people's judgments. Find yourself with help of others and when you experience this, try to help other troubled people and do not be misled by those same- or other people. God does not divide us, only humans do. When we seek trust we can find it in our friends and family, but especially in God and his only son, Jesus.
