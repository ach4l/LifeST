{"comment_0": "\nAnother amazing, sexy hit by Camila Cabello. Between the slow melody and Camila's sensual voice, this song was made to set the mood anytime. With the detailed lyrics about her hips as she dances, and the image of an aloof and unattainable woman, this song makes you want to move your hips in a not-so-PG way. I always enjoy a song about woman power, and let me tell you that Camila Cabello is feeling herself in this one. The only thing that could make this hit better? Quavo in the background saying \"Oh my god\" about Camila and her body, making you want to sing along. It seems like Camila is only capable of putting out super sexy music. And I'm okay with that.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
