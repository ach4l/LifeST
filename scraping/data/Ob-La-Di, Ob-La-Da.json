Paul met him in the Bag o' Nails club in Solo, London. When Paul wrote the song, Jimmy Scott was annoyed, citing that he should receive some of the financial rewards for it. McCartney responded by telling him that if he had written any part of it, he would be glad to pay him, but he didn't. Scott sued, and meanwhile, was jailed for refusing to pay support to his ex-wife. Jimmy appealed to Paul to pay his rather large past support payment, which Paul did to help him out, but on the condition that Jimmy drop his case against him over the song. Jimmy did and he and Paul came to be and remained close friends over the years until Scott's death in 1986.\n\r\nPaul loved this song and made many takes of it, driving the remaining three Beatles' crazy. McCartney wanted it released also as a single, but Lennon hated it and refused to let that happen. Consequently, a Scottish group known as Marmalade recorded it and had a number one hit. There is a mistake in the song where McCartney sang that \"Desmond stayed at home and did his pretty face,\" when it should have been as the other similar line, referring to Molly. The three other Beatles liked the error, and it remained. Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace, Molly is the singer in a band, Desmond says to Molly, girl I like you face\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_21": "\nI love this song, sure it's silly as hell but it's really fun.

Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face\" was an indication that Molly (the woman) did all the work...but it's weirder than that. The hint of what's to come is what Desmond says to Molly, \"Girl, I like your face\"...\n\nThe truth is that Desmond is a drag queen-- a straight drag queen (they DO exist!). He likes (that is, envies) her face... later, when Desmond is in the marketplace \"Molly stays at home and does her pretty face, and in the evening she still sings it with the band\"... but when Molly's in the marketplace, \"Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face, and in the evening she's a singer in the band\"-- and that \"she\" refers to Desmond, not Molly!  And the jaunty piano riff underlying that last line points it up his stint with the band with his pretty face done up.  Pretty subversive even today, and remarkable for the '60s, which is probably why so few people got it.
