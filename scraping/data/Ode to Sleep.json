{"comment_0": "\nOK, so I heard Tyler say in an interview that this song IS Twenty One Pilots. That it summarizes who they are. I thought\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 hmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 really? And after looking at they lyrics, I'm going to take a guess at why he said that...\n\r\nAs anyone who knows their lyrics has figured out, Tyler has been tormented by negative thoughts and even thoughts of suicide. In Christian imagery, and several of their songs, these \"evil thoughts\" are represented by demons (whether you believe them to be true demons or just psychological attacks from a darkness within). And in Christian belief, demons attack those that they see as a threat. \n\r\nThis song is basically saying - hey, maybe Tyler is being attacked because he is a threat - because he has the capacity/means to be an instrument of good (through his pen / the band's music). There's a purpose for him on this earth. \n\r\nAnd in the song, he's crying out to a higher power (God) saying, \"Aaaah!! Why? I don't want this on my shoulders! I don't want this purpose! I don't want this pen! Tell the demons you have no plans for me! I don't want to do this! This isn't the freedom you promised!\"\n\r\nAnd in the end, he tells God that he's \"sorry.\" He realizes the plans that God has for him, to be a mouthpiece of hope - to encourage young people to think, and to survive, and to live. And that's why this song is so important to Twenty One Pilots.\n\r\n(And as others have said, the three denials (echoing the story of Peter) and the fourth denial about \"not telling\" whom he's singing toward (God/higher power) is something with which he struggles. He doesn't want to sing and write songs and perform for money and fame (\"whore\") - he wants to fulfill his purpose.)\n\r\nThat's my interpretation. Not sure I got it right, but if I'm even close (and I think I am), then it's just another reason to love this band.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\n\"Ode to Sleep\" is one of my favorite songs lyrically from twenty one pilots (who happens to be my favorite band of the last decade) and admittedly one of the most difficult to interpret. The song is deeper that what most believe. I think the following is pretty close, but I'm sure I may have missed some nuances or gotten it wrong in some places.\n\r\nThe lyrical genius of Tyler Joseph portrays a torrid struggle between voices of darkness and the songwriter's struggle to overcome the darkness. The song is girded in spirituality and the voices that are attempting to overcome his mind are in fact demons or even Satan. The song also happens to be all over the map musically, which I feel adds to this struggle and to the song's uniqueness.\n\r\n\"I wake up fine and dandy\r\nBut then by the time I find it handy\r\nTo rip my heart apart and start\r\nPlanning my crash landing\r\nI go up to the ceiling\r\nThen I feel my soul start leaving\r\nLike an old man's hair receding\"\n\r\nHe starts his days well, but inevitably as his day progresses he begins on a self-destructive path toward hopelessness, giving up, and perhaps taking his life.  Later lyrics seem to indicated he may also be struggling with guilt over his hypocritical thoughts and actions that betray his faith and beliefs [in God and Christ] but more on this later. However, just as he's \"planning [his] crash landing\" - taking himself out - he is brought \"up to the ceiling\" and \"feels his soul start leaving\" as God brings him back into a healthier state of mind. I'll admit I am somewhat unsure of the meaning of this verse, but I think my interpretation fits well with the struggle portrayed by the rest of the song. \n\r\n\"I'm pleading, \"Please, oh please!\"\r\nOn my knees repeatedly asking\r\nWhy it's got to be like this\r\nIs this living free?\r\nI don't wanna be the one\r\nTo have the sons blood on my hands\"\n\r\nDuring this time with God as he reflects on his failure to live the way he wants to - the way God desires that he live - he pleads with God asking why he has to continue to struggle in his fight against hopelessness and sin and the forces that continue to seem to ensnare him and tell him to give up. \"Is this living free?\" Obviously not. Additionally, the songwriter does not want to be a hypocrite by continuing to sin and nail holes into the wrists of his Savior (\"I don't wanna be the one to have the son's blood on my hands\") and the son he is referring to is Christ, the son of God. Christ shed his blood to atone for the sins of man (or for those who believe depending on your theology). The songwriter is in turmoil because he knows he is hurting the his Savior and not living in the freedom that is meant for him.\n\r\nAt this point, I believe the songwriter begins to transition into a new, more hopeful thought process. My favorite lyric in this song is \"I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.\" This phrase could have one of several meanings: he will choose to physically stay alive and not allow the enemy to take his life; he will choose to stay spiritually awake and vigilant in his struggle against what the evil voices are telling him to do, and thus not be taken prisoner; or perhaps he's simply referring to staying awake.\n\r\n\"Why am I not scared in the morning?\r\nI don't hear those voices calling\r\nI must have kicked them out\r\nI must have kicked them out\n\r\nI swear I heard demons yelling\r\nThose crazy words they were spelling\r\nThey told me I was gone\r\nThey told me I was gone\"\n\r\nAt some point during the night, after his decision to \"stay awake,\" the songwriter  seems to have squelched the voices of the demons that were speaking \"crazy words\" into his brain, telling him he \"was gone\" - that it was hopeless, he was done for, and that he might as well give up (and perhaps take his life).\n\r\n\"But I'll tell 'em\r\nWhy won't you let me go\r\nDo I threaten all your plans?\r\nI'm insignificant\"\n\r\nHe inquires of the demons why they continue to torment him, as he sees himself as ultimately insignificant in the kingdom of God and that his life will not threaten the plans of the enemy (to lead people away from God). Why does he not see himself as a threat? Because following, during the bridge, he clearly states that his witness for God and Christ is nonexistent because he is afraid to tell others who he adores.\n\r\n\"I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times\r\nSame amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime\r\nI'm afraid to tell you who I adore\r\nWon't tell you who I'm singing towards\r\nMetaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four\"\n\r\nThis passage is clearly a reference to the three time denial of Christ by Peter in the New Testament of the Bible. The songwriter has denied Christ because, as I said before, he is afraid to tell others who he adores and who he's singing towards. The bridge also has some other great lines in it. \"The start of a day when we put on our face a mask that portrays that we don't need grace\" alludes our bad habit of pretending we're without fault (sin) and we don't need the undeserved favor of God. \"On the eve of a day that is bigger than us\" I believe means that our lives are not about us, but instead about how God uses us in His grand story. \"And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead desperately yelling, \"There's something we need!\" - Creation pleads with us that we need help - that we need a Savior from ourselves and from the lying voices of the enemy that tell us to give up. \n\r\n\"Please tell 'em\r\nYou have no plans for me\r\nI will set my soul on fire\r\nWhat have I become?\"\n\r\nAt this point, he even asks of God to tell Satan or the demons that he has no significance and that God has no plans for him in God's kingdom. This is clearly part of the demon's lies that the songwriter has been believing about himself. This is the turmoil. This is the struggle. I believe the lyrics \"I will set my soul on fire\" means he is so deep in despair that he desires to destroy his soul. In his hypocrisy and denials of God he asks \"what have I become?\"\n\r\n\"I'm sorry\"\n\r\nIt's pretty clear here, if you buy into my interpretation of this song, the songwriter is apologizing to God.\n\r\nPart of the beauty and genius of Tyler's lyrics is that although they have a deep spiritual meaning (in this case Christian), they can also be interpreted in many different ways, making his heartfelt and honest lyrics that deal with real problems accessible to so many.\n\r\n|-/\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI've always felt like this song represents Tyler's mind at war (referenced in 'Migraine'). His mind is always tripping over itself, he is always thinking deeply, whether good or bad. He is a slave to himself, trapped by his inability to be mentally calm. And when once in a while when he is free, and when his mind has calmed he is lost and doesnt know what to do, \"Why am I not scared in the morning?\nI don't hear those voices calling\nI must have kicked them out\"\nThis is my person interpretation, probably cause i feel the same as this, maybe its just a personal connection, but everyone interprets the lyrics different.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis song seems to be the basic cry of an insomniac. It beautifully portrays the intense struggle one finds himself in once he lies down for sleep. You start to think about everything that has gone wrong, but most of all the wrongs you caused. Mind racing and \"demons yelling\", one also finds himself in the perfect position to write, as there is rarely another time when an insomniac's mind will bring forth as much information as when said person is attempting to sleep. However, once the writing begins, it is hard to stop in time to get the amount of sleep you were aiming for, therefore placing anxiety on the fulfillment of priorities, such as work. It is at this moment that the decision is made to stay awake. The \"dark\" can't take prisoners that don't sleep.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis song is about a mans struggles as a follower of God to trust in his forgiveness.\n\r\n\"I'm afraid to tell you who I adore\r\nWon't tell you who I'm singing towards\r\nMetaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four\"\n\r\nThis line he is saying that he is afraid to tell people that he believes in God, and that his lyrics are directed towards Him. By whore it is ment currupt and he is currupt and a hyporcrite by not singing what he believes. Which makes denial number for, anothe denail as related to the 3 denials of Peter in the bible.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nThe part where it says \"I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times\nSame amount that I denied,\" reminds me of around John 21:16, when Jesus asks peter \"Do you love me?\" three times because Peter denied him three times.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI think in order to truly understand Ode to Sleep, you need to look not just at the lyrics, but the song itself. The title \"Ode to Sleep\" may represent how Tyler's mind is not at rest. The melody frequently changes throughout the song, and that may represent how rapidly Tyler thinks and how many thoughts he can have in his mind because he is such a deep and thoughtful person. \nI wake up fine and dandy\nBut by the time I find it handy\nTo rip my heart apart and start \nPlanning my crash landing \nI go up to the ceiling\nAnd I feel my soul start leaving\nLike an old mans hair receding\nI think this stanza could be interpreted in a few different ways. One way is that he wakes up fine, but then the \"demons\" get to him and he begins to feel suicidal (hence: ripping his heart apart and planning his crash landing) but then God saves him from the demons. However, I think ripping his heart apart and planning his crash landing could also mean simply writing a song. I know it may sound odd but hear me out on this. \"Ripping his heart apart\" may mean exposing his heart and showing it in songs he writes, and planning his crash landing may be the effects of spending too much time thinking negatively, (letting the demons in). When he talks about going up to the ceiling and feeling his soul leaving, that may refer to writer's block because so much of his music expresses how he feels agonized by the demons in his mind and if he does not feel agonized, he can't really write about it, and feeling his soul leaving may be about how he fears he may lose his depth and ability to write so deeply. This song, in a way, is an internal fight inside of Tyler's mind about how he feels he must choose between happiness and fulfillment (his ability to write music the way he does). \nI'm pleading \"Please, oh, please.\"\nOn my knees repeatedly asking\nWhy it's got to be like this\nIs this living free?\nI don't wanna be the one\nTo have the sons blood on my hands\nI'll tell the moon\nTake this weapon, forged in darkness\nSome see a pen, I see a harpoon\nIn addition to being an internal fight, this song is also, in my opinion, a prayer. He is telling God that he does not think he is cut out for the plans God has for him to write music about the darkness in people's lives and attempt to bring them out of it, and that he doesn't want to have so much of God's faith, because that makes him a target to the demons, who in Christian faith attack anyone they find threatening to them (represented by his agonizing thoughts). It is also a contradiction to what he said at first about how he feels his soul leaving. \nI'll stay awake \nCause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight \nWhy am I not scared in the morning?\nI don't hear those voices calling\nI must have kicked them out\nAnother contradiction. Now he feels happy and free again.\nI swear I heard demons yelling\nThose crazy words they were spelling\nThey told me I was gone \nNow, looking back, fear may be beginning to creep back into his mind again. Another contradiction.\nI tell 'em \nWhy won't you let me go?\nDo I threaten all your plans?\nI'm insignificant\nNow, he feels that he would rather truly be insignificant than have to suffer through being tortured by the demons. He tries to tell the demons that he is not a threat to them so that they might leave him alone. \nPlease tell them \nYou have no plans for me\nI will set my soul on fire\nWhat have I become?\nI'll tell 'em\nAt the beginning of this stanza, Tyler is talking to God, begging Him to tell the demons to leave him alone by saying he is not a threat. At this point of the song, Tyler is saying that he would be willing to destroy his soul (the part of him that allows him to make the music he does) just so the demons will leave him alone. The last two lines are him talking to himself. He asks himself what he has become, what the demons and songwriting have caused him to become. When he says \"I'll tell 'em\", he's become impatient with God, so he wants to take matters into his own hands.\nOn the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake\nAs the trees, they await and clouds anticipate\nThe start of a day when we put on our face,\nA mask that portrays that we don't need grace,\nOn the eve of a day that is bigger than us,\nBut we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must,\nAnd the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead,\nDesperately yelling there's something we need,\nI'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times,\nSame amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime,\nI'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards,\nMetaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four.\nThe \"day\" may be referring to Good Friday (the day in Christian faith where Jesus died on the cross for everyone's sin) because he is talking about how the \"masks\" we're an attempt to hide the fact that Christian people felt lost without Jesus, and nature is begging for Him back. I think he felt it necessary to add this to the song because that may be how he currently felt, lost and alone and he felt that God was not by his side. Then, he begins talking about his own faith, and how he asked for forgiveness three times but also denied his faith three times, that may be an explanation for why he feels he is not as powerful against the demons as he could be. However, he also says he does not want to recognize God as the person he is singing about in his songs. I think when he says he's a whore, he means that he is not willing to show his faith, because a whore can mean someone who does not show loyalty or faith to anyone in particular, and because he calls that another denial of his faith. \nWhat have I become?\nI'm sorry.\nAt the end of the song, Tyler figures that he may also be to blame for what he feels, and his apology may be to himself, to God, or to anyone he knows. He is sorry because he let the demons change him so much that he may have lost sight of who he was before.\nOde to Sleep is personally one of my favorite songs by Twenty \u00c3\u0098ne Pil\u00c3\u00b8ts because of how clever it is all around.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nAn interpretation of Ode to Sleep by Twenty One Pilots-Verse by verse\n\r\nI wake up fine and dandy but by the time I find it handy\r\nTo rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing\r\nI go up up up up up to the ceiling, then I feel my soul start leaving,\r\nLike an old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair receding\r\nOne has to be pretty knowledgeable about Tyler Joseph to get this song in general. So let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lay this out. Tyler has struggled with plenty of negative thoughts, and even suicidal feelings, and parts of this song reflect that. Tyler (and Josh) both are Christians, and this song has heavy religious undertones, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for them.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wake up fine and dandy\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to waking up in the morning and feeling great. Everyone knows how it is, after you get past the morning tiredness, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re usually pretty energetic, right? Most are, anyway. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the time I find it handy/ to rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to the depression and suicidal thoughts setting in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI go up up up up up to the ceiling, then I feel my soul start leaving/like an old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair receding\u00e2\u0080\u009d is referring to the singer (Tyler) being lifted up, motivated, cheered up, whatever you want to call it, by God.\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleading \u00e2\u0080\u009cplease, oh please\u00e2\u0080\u009d on my knees repeatedly\r\nAsking why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to be like this, is this living free?\r\nI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wanna be the one, be the one who has the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood on my hands,\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell the moon, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake this weapon forged in darkness;\r\nSome see a pen, I see a harpoon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nThe first two lines there, indicate Tyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggles as a song writer. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crying out to God, pleading to have the struggles and constricting force of his sins and wrong-doings as well as other burdens lifted from him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this living free?\u00e2\u0080\u009d No. The next three lines were a hard one, but here are my thoughts.\r\nTOP is pretty well known for their metaphors; almost nothing is exactly what it looks like. My thought is perhaps, \u00e2\u0080\u009csun\u00e2\u0080\u009d has two meanings here. The sun is a light, yes? Jesus is the light of the world, but he is also the son of God. Tyler doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want Christ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood on his hands, but he is struggling with internal battles because he is a sinful being, as we all are, and he knows that he is not perfect, and his bad choices hurt Christ.\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m kind of unsure on what the moon has to do with it, but my best thought is that when he says he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell the moon to take the weapon forged in darkness, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to pass the deed off on someone else. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere; you take it, you do it. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the blood on my hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The moon could also be referring to a darker being. Perhaps one of the demons he mentions later on?\r\nWe know the saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pen is mightier than the sword.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, here, a pen is being compared to a harpoon. Tyler is acknowledging the power that words can have, for better or for worse. A harpoon is capable of doing a lot of damage; a pen holds that same deadly power. But, with his words, Tyler also knows he can spread hope. And the next part of the song takes on a happier, more hopeful feel.\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay awake; cuz the dark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not takin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prisoners tonight.\r\nThis line could have several meanings. But for my purposes, I have chosen one; He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to stay physically awake, to avoid torment in his dreams, when his mind is vulnerable. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be overwhelmed by the negativity that his sleep brings.\r\nWhy am I not scared in the morning? I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear those voices calling.\r\nI must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out.\r\nI swear I hear demons yelling, those crazy words they were spelling\r\nThey told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.\r\nTyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gaining confidence. He no longer hears the voices in his head; he must have kicked them out. Pretty literal. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gotten rid of them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI swear I heard demons yelling, those crazy words they were spelling/ they told me I was gone they told me I was gone\u00e2\u0080\u009d is referring to the negativity; it is being personified as demons. Demons also tend to target threats. This point discussed next.\r\nBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you let me go? Do I threaten all your plans?\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m insignificant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nPlease tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em\r\nYou have no plans for me\r\nI will set my soul on fire, what have I become?\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell \u00e2\u0080\u0098em\r\nSo the demons seem to think Tyler is a threat. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trying to tell them he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insignificant, and asking God to tell them that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a threat, because he just wants them to leave him alone. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tired of being tormented. Or, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beginning to believe the demons lies that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really not anything. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will set my soul on fire\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggests that he feels so far gone that he feels his soul must be destroyed(?), and then he asks himself \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have I become?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Seemingly looking with disbelief and hopelessness at what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying/doing. He can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s becoming.\r\nOn the eve of a day that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forgotten and fake\r\nAnd the trees they await and clouds anticipate\r\nThe start of a day when we put on our face\r\nA mask that portrays that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need grace\r\nOn the eve of a day that is bigger than us\r\nBut we open our eyes cuz we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told that we must\r\nAnd the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead\r\nDesperately yelling there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we need.\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not free. I asked forgiveness three times\r\nSame amount that I denied\r\nI three-time MVP\u00e2\u0080\u0099ed this crime\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid to tell you who I adore, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you who I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m singing towards\r\nMetaphorically, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a whore and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denial number four.\r\nOk. So big chunk of song here, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s break it down. And I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean try to rap it.\r\nA day that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forgotten and fake, through desperately yelling there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we need. This suggests a day, perhaps in history, that has been forgotten. Or could be. Looking at earlier parts of the song(specifically \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood), it could be suggested that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cforgotten day\u00e2\u0080\u009d is Good Friday, the day of the Crucifixion, or Easter, the day of the Resurrection. A mask that portrays that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need grace indicates a fa\u00c3\u00a7ade that Christians will sometimes present to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfit in\u00e2\u0080\u009d with society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s norms and practices.  We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need this, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re good enough on our own. But human nature contradicts this, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesperately yelling there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we need.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And we \u00e2\u0080\u009cawait\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009canticipate\u00e2\u0080\u009d that something(?)\r\nThe next chunk of the verse. Tyler is acknowledging that he isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t free. He is imprisoned by his wrongs, and by the darkness in his life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI asked forgiveness three times/ same amount that I denied\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers quite bluntly to Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denial of Christ in the New Testament. Jesus tells Peter that before the rooster crows, he(Peter) will deny him(Jesus) three times. Peter says \u00e2\u0080\u009cno, I will never deny you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But yet, when a servant girl asks if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disciples, He says \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He does this twice more, even getting angry and cursing at those who swear up and down that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen him with Jesus. Immediately after the third denial, the rooster crows. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.\" And he went outside and wept bitterly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The song seems to suggest that Tyler asks forgiveness after each denial. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMVP\u00e2\u0080\u009d in his crime of denying his faith.\r\nHe states that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cafraid to tell you who I adore, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you who I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m singing towards\u00e2\u0080\u009d, meaning that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denying his faith again, by neglecting to tell you who he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calling out to: God. The word \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhore\u00e2\u0080\u009d is defined as prostitute, which we know to mean someone who sells their body for sex, or one who is not faithful/loyal, in this respect. When Tyler says that he is metaphorically a whore, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conceding to the fact that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not being faithful/loyal to his God. And he admits to it being \u00e2\u0080\u009cdenial number four,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding to the first three that he mentioned.\r\nThe end of the song, where Tyler concludes with \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry\u00e2\u0080\u009d, is him apologising to God for his denial, and for his sin, and for everything else that he feels he is at fault for.\r\nAs a whole, this song digs into Tyler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggle as a Christian writer, who wants to share his beliefs without sharing them, and the torment he faces about his life, and his choices.\r\nAt least, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my view on it. -StressedOutLaneBoyWithAMigraine\n\n\n", "comment_8": "\nMy breakdown on the song\n\n\"I wake up fine and dandy but then by the time I find it handy,\nTo rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing,\" \n\n-he wakes up fine, but through the day, beats himself up so much, he's planning for how bad/guilty he'll feel later over his sin\n\n\"I'm pleading please, oh please on my knees repeatedly asking,\nwhy it's got to be like this. Is this living free?\"\n\n-he's pleading with God because he feels so guilty over his sin and beats himself up so much over it, he doesn't feel like he's living free as God said he would. Reference Bible verse \"whom the son sets free is free indeed\"\n\n\"I don't want to be the one, be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands,\nI'll tell the moon, take this weapon forged in darkness,\nSome see a pen, I see a harpoon.\"\n\n-sun's blood on his hands, really \"Son's blood\". he feels guilty because he (as we all are) is responsible for the death of Jesus as he died for our sins - he bled for us. That's what he means - he doesn't want to have Jesus's blood on his hands, the guilt of that. Take the weapon forged in darkness is how he uses his lyrics to write his dark feelings through his \"pen\" or harpoon.\n\n\"I'll stay awake,\nCause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.\"\n\n-possibly a reference to he is staying awake because he's too scared to sleep in a sense. Saying dark's not taking prisoners, Hell is the dark,  prisoner is him. \"Dark's not taking prisoners tonight - he's staying awake, he's staying awake so the dark can't take him.\n\n\"Why am I not scared in the morning?\nI don't hear those voices calling,\nI must have kicked them out\"\n\n-he feels he's recovered in the morning, he doesn't hear the voices calling him, telling him he's lost and not saved, he feels secure. \"he must've kicked them out\". \n\nI swear I heard demons yelling,\nThose crazy words they were spelling,\nThey told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.\n\n-the demons were telling him he's lost, he's gone, a goner. \"I'm a goner...somebody catch my breath\" ;). I guess the demons were lying to him when he wrote Goner too. \n\n\"But I'll tell them\nWhy won't you let me go?\nDo I threaten all your plans?\nI'm insignificant\"\n\n-he's telling the demons, please leave me be in peace, i'm not going to getting in your way or \"threaten all your plans, I'm insignificant\". He's not important to God's plan (in his own mind). \n\n\"Please tell them you have no plans for me\nI will set my soul on fire\nWhat have I become?\nI'll tell them\"\n\n-telling God, please tell the demons you don't have any plans for me, you're not going to use me as a key for the kingdom. \"I will set my soul on fire\" - saying I don't need the demons to set my soul on fire, I mess up so much,  I'll do it myself. I'll destroy myself, I don't need the demons help to do it.Then he reflects by saying \"what have I become?\"\n\n\"On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake,\nAnd the trees they await and clouds anticipate\"\n\n-eve of day forgotten and fake - not sure, maybe he is dissing God, saying the day of Jesus Christ's return is forgotten - and disses by calling it fake as well. The trees and clouds anticipate because even all of the earth obeys Gods so they wait on him. As a preacher once said \"God tells sun to rise, it rises, ocean waves to come this far and they go no further and they obey, God says to man, come to me and man says no!\"\n\n\"The start of a day when we put on our face,\nA mask that portrays that we don't need grace\"\n\n-saying that we get up and pretend everything is okay - put on our masks acting as if we don't need God's grace when we're really broken and in need of grace and mercy\n\n\"On the eve of a day that is bigger than us,\nBut we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must,\"\n\n-the day of Christ's return, a day that is bigger than us, we open our eyes to the truth\n\n\"And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead,\nDesperately yelling there's something we need,\"\n\n-Trees and clouds obey God remember, so they are pleading with us as they probably have more truth than we do. lol. Desperately yelling there's something we need - that something is salvation, as we are lost sinners before we come to Christ.\n\n\"I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times,\nSame amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime,\"\n\n-yet Tyler is saying he is not free. Maybe Tyler is not saved, but a lost sinner. Bible says \"whoever Son sets free is free indeed\", yet Tyler says he is not. He says he's asked forgiveness three times, but apparently doesn't feel saved. \"Same amound that I denied\" - reference to Peter denying Jesus, he says he does the same thing and as a matter of fact, he is an MVP at doing it (self deprecating).\n\n\"I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards,\nMetaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four.\"\n\n-he doesn't want to straight out tell us He adores God, which is sad since he calls himself a Christian. Sad for me too as I'm guilty of the same. He won't say who he's singing towards lol. Come on Tyler, it's obvious it's God. He just denied Jesus again by not saying who he's singing towards.\n\nThat's my take, hopefully Tyler is a saved Christian and me as well. I encourage you all to seek God and get in His word. Let's believe what God said is true, \"while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us\" and \"whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nhe's talking about his faith in god and trying escape his sinful life {the voices tell him to sin)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nAs I seen a lot of religious interpretations (not sayin' that is wrong to do so), I would like to see it from the other side. \nI find this song amazing in a lot of ways. First of all, the music is amazing. It creates an instant of catharsis in which you can feel the struggle. And above all, there's the lyrics.\nAs a human, you wake up every morning trying to enjoy the brand new day. You wake up fine and dandy, but then by the time you find it handy. If you have somehow consider suicidal thoughts, you may know the war that every feeling battles in your head. But then here it comes the incredible thing that i find about this lyrics: the Sun and the Moon. The Sun, in most cultures, is the father; the Moon is the mother. And I think he is (Tyler) somehow dissapointing them by choosing the music for a job. (He has explained in some interiews that he was no genius in school so his parents tried to put in sports so he got some scholarship)\nSo this could mean that he tries to sleep fine at night, but the unsecure future that he has it's somehow troubling his mind. And believe me, that can scares you the shit out.\nThen it cames \"the morning\", which is when you see the light, a way out: music.\nSo he will tell them get off me, \"do I threaten all your plans?\", cause the orthodox way of life is suposed to get into some regular job and then die. But Tyler won't. He wants to set his soul on fire, to let the music be his way of life.\nThe next verse is pretty much a christian statement, considering all the references to the Bible. So I won't talk much about it. Tyler is obviously a religious guy.\nSo the last verse, in which he keeps trying to explain why he doesn't make any much difference in the dayly life, but he wants to live his life on fire, and the \"I'm sorry\" part, as many of you have considered as a petition for God, I disagree.\nAs I said before, he's sorry for not being what his parents wants him to be. \nLast but not least, if we consider the name of the song \"Ode to Sleep\", we can assure that now he can sleep better, knowing that he is living the life he wants to live. We may say, he's living the morning.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nI think this song is his struggle with depression and/or suicidal thoughts.  On one hand you have this evil person trying to take over his body.  Then you have this other side that is trying to push back these thoughts and regain control of his body and mind. \n\r\nThe way he tells this story is what really gets me. It's like you are watch this epic tale of how one man struggles to regain a quality of life where he controls what his mind thinks and sees. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nThese are all great interpretations.  I looked at their video for this song to look for some additional meaning.  I agree with the idea that Tyler is struggling with his 'purpose' as Moonbeam86 pointed out.  \n\nThe video illustrates that over time (2011 - 12 friends, 2013 - few hundred, 2014 - thousands).  That they are able to reach a larger audience and perhaps the video shows that he overcame these doubts about his 'purpose'. \n\nThese guys are surrounded by some very talented video story telling folks.  Their videos consistently do a good job of telling the story of the song, visually.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nForgot the last line\n\n\"What have I become?\nI'm sorry\"\n\n-then Tyler apologizes to God for what he's become\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\nI'm pleading, \"Please, oh please!\"\nOn my knees repeatedly asking\nWhy it's got to be like this\nIs this living free?\nI don't wanna be the one\nTo have the sons blood on my hands\nI'll tell the moon\nTake this weapon, forged in darkness\nSome see a pen, I see harpoon\n\n-This first verse pretty much sums up the song; Seems to me he is writing about the music industry and signing his soul away with the \"harpoon\". The rest of the song touches on his struggle with this - maybe he regrets it, or maybe he beat it... He is constantly battling the demons...Struggling to make it and get his songs out there and heard - fighting the industry and the simpleton sounds/beats and meaningless lyrics that are taking over today's music. \n\nBut I tell 'em\nWhy won't you let me go\nDo I threaten all your plans?\nI'm insignificant\n\n-This makes me think he beat them/or trying to at least... His lyrics and sounds are so unique/deep/meaningful and he is sticking to it, whether he gets beat down for it or not - He will not not conform to what the music industry wants/expects in today's sounds - so does he threaten them? Think about his Car Radio interview and live tapings where he says that he was not aware there were rules to song writing - Think about \"Holding Onto You\" Lean with it, rock with it,\nWhen we gonna stop with it,\nLyrics that mean nothing, we were gifted with thought,\nIs it time to move our feet to an introspective beat,\nIt ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat.\n\nBasically saying quit the bullshit beats and lyrics (Which the music industry pushes today)... Rather, let's use our gift of thought and talent. \n\nPlease tell 'em\nYou have no plans for me\nI will set my soul on fire\nWhat have I become?\n\nI'm thinking he is saying that he will set his soul on fire before before he signs it away with that weapon (pen/harpoon)... He would rather put his poem lyrics, meaningful and full-filling out there, than \"sell out\" and conform to what is \"expected\"... His soul to the \"devil\" (music industry...) isn't worth the riches/ fame and conformity to the dark side...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
