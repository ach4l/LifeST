(murdered him). \"a blue tick hound, She was pretty as she could be, Well they penned her up in the swampland, 'Bout a mile just south of the gate, And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run, I'd just drop him off and wait\" he took the dog to see the other dog and just let Red do his thing. Now Ol' Red got real used to seeing His lady every night, And so I kept him away for three or four days,And waited till the time got right\" Rdd was used to seeing the other dog so he kept him away for a few days so that when he was out for his run, he would go to the female instead of follow blake. \"Love got me in here and love got me out\" Love got him in there because he killed the man that was with is wife... love got him out because Red fell in love with the blue tick.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
