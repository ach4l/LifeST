It's all about helping each other when we need it most. Who cares about the religion or commercial aspects of Christmas? Those things may matter to some, but in reality, all that matters is the charity. It seems that Christmas is the only time of year that everyone gathers together for the goodness of mankind, and it's a shame that it doesn't last longer than just that wintery season.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
