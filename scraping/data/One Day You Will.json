This is one of Lady-A's best. This song completely captures the pain of breaking up with someone and knowing that it will hurt for a while, but encourages faith in better days to come. \r\n\"I know right now that's not the way you feel, but one day you will.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI hope so.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\n..love it\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI Love this song, It means so much to me and has helped me through so much. makes me hope that there is better things in my future\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI love this song.  I don't know if it's about a relationship necessarily or about someone struggling in general...but I look at it the struggling way.  In that sense, it's a great inspirational song.  Something to listen to when you're really down and need to hear that line, \"Just keep holding on...I know right now that's not the way you feel.  But one day you will.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
