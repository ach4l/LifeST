Taking another lonely girls out of the world.\n\r\nNow listen to that song and not think it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\n\"Alright let's go\r\nThere's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)\r\nOne less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)\r\nThere's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)\r\nOne less lonely girl (ha)\"\n\r\nThe song begins faily innocently. Beiber says over and over that there will be \"one less lonely girl\". This means he will date said girl, eliminating the aforementioned loneliness, correct? Yes, the opening is innocent... until... the little laugh. Have you fooled us, Mr. Bieber? What, pray tell, is so funny?\n\r\n\"How many I told you\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and start overs\r\nAnd shoulders have you cried on before\r\nHow many promises be honest girl\r\nHow many tears you let hit the floor\r\nHow many bags you packed\r\nJust to take \u00e2\u0080\u0098em back tell me that\r\nHow many either or's but no more\r\nIf you let me inside of your world\r\nThere'll be the one less lonely girl\"\n\r\nHere, Bieber has found the perfect victim. A heartbroken young girl (who evidently enjoys traveling, and will be further referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cLonely Girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d) with nothing left to live for but her sweet, innocent Mr. Bieber. Her heartbreak leaves her an easy victim, highly susceptible to the charms of the prepubescent Casanova. \n\r\n\"Ohh Oh Oh\r\nSaw so many pretty faces before I saw you you\r\nNow all I see is you\r\nI'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)\"\n\r\nAha! Here is where Bieber confesses his intentions. He doesn't wish to cure Lonely Girl of her loneliness, making her one less lonely girl; rather, he intends to do away with Lonely Girl altogether! He sees \"only her\", a line frequently used to describer the stalker to stalkee realtionship. He finishes the chorus with \"I'm coming for you\", the first definitive evidence of his murderous tendencies. You know who else comes for you? Freddy Kruger *hums 'One, Two, Freddy's Coming For You'*. When Freddy comes for you, he wants to kill you. Young Justin's coming for you is of no important difference.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNoo No\r\nDon't need these other pretty faces like I need you\r\nAnd when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mine in the world\r\nThere's gonna be one less lonely girl\r\n(I'm coming for you) One less lonely girl\r\n(I'm coming for you) One less lonely girl\r\n(I'm coming for you)One less lonely girl\r\nThere's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)\r\nI'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)\r\nI'll show you what you're worth (That's what I'm gonna do)\r\nIf you let me inside your world\r\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna be one less lonely girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nAnd here, we glimpse Bieber's twisted, disturbed mind. He assures us that he is most definitely coming for Lonely Girl, and that when all is said and done, there will be 'one less lonely girl'. The possibility of a planned murder is reinforced by the next lines: he plans to show Lonely Girl what she's worth (i.e. nothing) by murdering her. With this in mind, his request for entrance into Lonely Girl's world seems more like a threat than an offer to love her forever.\n\r\nFollowing this is mainly Justin's unstable ramblings about his obsession with Lonely Girl and his intentions to kill her. From this point, I will highlight only the most important evidence.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI just wanna set one girl free to fall,\r\nFree to fall (she's free to fall)\r\nFall in love\r\nWith me\r\nHer hearts locked and nowhere to get the key\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nAnd he confesses! He leaves Lonely Girl \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree to fall\u00e2\u0080\u009d in love with him. Knowing he has managed to fool his prey, he swoops down for the kill! He \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake[s] her\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the world is left with \u00e2\u0080\u009cone less Lonely Girl\u00e2\u0080\u009d, finishing his sickening crime. \n\r\nYoung Mr. Bieber is a menace to society. It is too late for us to save Lonely Girl, but the world is filled with girls just like her. If Bieber will not rest until he has \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaken\u00e2\u0080\u009d each of them, we must not rest until this madchild is behind bars. And lonely girls, watch out: next time he could be coming for YOU.\n\n\n", "comment_4": "\nfuck justin beiber he is a no good cocksucking piece of shit\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nMy b best friend actually left that.

This album is bullshit. Justin Bieber is bullshit. His fans are bullshit. His music is bullshit. The modern music industry is bullshit. It's bullshit that he's famous. He's not famous for writing good music. He's famous because he's a boy but he looks/sounds like a girl and he's \"safe\" so the girlies love him. Record execs decided to capitolize off of this by making albums plastered with his face and bullshit music that appeals to young ignorant girls. As a result of that, they get a bunch of money. This has been going on for a while, but Justin Bieber really is a great example of it.
