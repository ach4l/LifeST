I really relate as I'm finally coming out of a 3 year depression. \n\r\nAnd the music!!! The intonation, etc of the lead singer (see, I don't even know his name) is emotional and you really feel pain when you here it. \n\r\nThe way it goes form the sing song calm beat of a depressed guy plodding thru glum thoughts to the total frustration, rage, etc in the remainderis uncanny.

The invisable mind prison we are in. Not one person on this planet has experienced true freedom because of this system in place. \n\r\nWhen you truly question this world you will see things are not what they seem and we are all in a complete state of confusion. We have lost touch with who we really are and james heitfield describes this in this quote.\r\n'' I can't remember anything Can't tell if this is true or dream .Deep down inside I feel the scream\r\nThis terrible silence stops it there''\n\r\nNow he describes when he felt most real and it doesnt involve being in this world but wishes it was.... See More\r\n'' Back in the womb it's much too real, In pumps life that I must feel .But can't look forward to reveal . Look to the time when I'll live''\n\r\nThis describes the slave machines we have become and in the matrix film it is seen with plugs all over their body.\r\n''Fed through the tube that sticks in me, Just like a wartime novelty. Tied to machines that make me be ,Cut this life off from me''.\n\r\nNow james realizes how far out his beliefs are to most and how alone it makes him feel.\r\n'' Now the world is gone I'm just one ,Oh god, help me ''\n\r\nFinally the whole mind prison (matrix) described in what it does to people, be honest with your self. you may not even realize your confused. if your believe in this worlds system you have fallen into the trap.\r\n'' Darkness imprisoning me, All that I see Absolute horror.... See More\r\nI cannot live, I cannot die .Trapped in myself\r\nBody my holding cell'' .\n\r\nIts all a mind war in either being brainwashed and controlled or realizing truth. The battle has long ago for the robbery of your mind. They are very much winning the battle let me tell you.Release the poison they have infected you with if you have bought into this world. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\ni love this song, the solo in it is fuckin badass too\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nthis song tries to show a hidden unpleasant side of war to tell everyone that war isn't pretty and isn't as fun as you see in the movies. \nwar is ugly. that's where Metallica tries to tell us\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nwhat a cool song.about \"johnny got his gun\" a bloke who had his arms legs and face blown off in an accident.and cant sense anything but can only think.harsh stuff.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nThis song is my all time favorite song of all time.... while it was written about \" Jonny got his gun\" I think it also represents not being able to be heard and has no way to get anything out... all you can do is think about it...... because no one will listen....

I get into the house and I drink some of my WHISKEY in a JAR but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ease the pain clearly caused by the THORN WITHIN. At this point even i know the only solutions to deal with the STRUGGLE WITHIN. In the SMALL HOURS of the morning I stare into the dark night and see ORION, but now is not the time to think about ASTRONOMY the pain is too much it feels like I'm TRAPPED UNDER ICE yet I cant seem to convince myself that its my fault, betrayed by who i thought was a friend and betrayed by THE JUDAS KISS now I go towards my bed in this old rugged house, how am I supposed to sleep in THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT after I shot him between the eyes and left him STONE DEAD FOREVER and at that point it felt like NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. I close my eyes and try to sleep hoping it will all just FADE to BLACK but THE MEMORY REMAINS clear to me that I will always be UNFORGIVEN and it worries me because the things i just did make me wonder AM I EVIL. This cant be I was raised right how did I turn to this BAD SEED I know what I did was wrong but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like I am on ANESTHESIA.\n\r\nI had lost my mind when I decided it was KILLING TIME, I ran around taking them all out high on drugs I believed I was the INVISIBLE KID and the opponents I took out one by one where DISPOSABLE HEROES. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep so I stay up looking at the DIRTY WINDOW and start to think maybe its time I DISAPPEAR because right now I am CREEPING DEATH at any point the cops and feds will be all over looking for me. For so long I looked forward to exerting my revenge but that day seemed to be THE DAY THAT NEVER COMES nothing hurts more than taking the life of your BROTHERS IN ARMS. The pain was too much yet still I feel like the HERO OF THE DAY and I decided not to think about what others thought of me after all to the one who I was revenging I would always be the perfect PRINCE CHARMING her LOVERMAN as was the case when she lived and everyone else called me KING NOTHING. As my nerves began to calm I remember what MAMA SAID about salvation forgiveness trusting in God and THE FOUR HORSEMEN but I will not pray to THE GOD THAT FAILED seeing as he let my loved one die she truly was MY FRIEND OF MISERY so I decide to live the rest of my life with NO REMORSE.\n\r\nKnowing my fate as I step into the bathroom that bottle of CYANIDE seems appealing but I will not give up I will FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. Arrested I find myself locked in a SANATARIUM because the cops couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any normal person could do what I did. The DEVILS DANCE is what they called it and maybe this is where I would spend the rest of my days on THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY. A brilliant mind I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve to be here but what i did deserves to be punished and that is SAD BUT TRUE. At this rate I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think even a priest can PURIFY my soul. I think of to myself POOR TWISTED ME but I decide to not have self pity because when it comes to who killed those men I will always be the ONE. From a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy RONNIE went on to become a killer and sometimes I would think SO WHAT right until the judge decided i would RIDE the LIGHTENING. I know I am SOME KIND of MONSTER but do I really deserve to die. The judge is not letting me off easy as he proclaims THAT WAS JUST YOUR LIFE and now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached THE END OF THE LINE. Alone in my cell I think it seems I have become THE OUTLAW TORN thinking about SUICIDE AND REDEMPTION what to do I cant let them kill me oh the STRUGGLE WITHIN talk about THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE.
