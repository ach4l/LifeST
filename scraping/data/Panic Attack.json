Now, if you look delirium up in the dictionary, it says that an episode of delirium is usually caused by the withdrawal from alchohol, which in turn, causes all of the things described in this song (delusions, dehydration, seizures..etc). This song is awesome, though, my favorite song from the Octavarium with Never Enough & The Root Of All Evil trailing close behind.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nIt's about panic attacks, as the name says.

This song describes exactly what happens to me when I have a panic attack. I wish I would have heard this song a long time ago- It really makes me feel less alone in this. If there's one thing people should know about this song, its that it is NOT exaggerating what happens during a panic attack. This is exactly how it feels- In some cases it may be even worse. If you feel like this at times for what seems like no reason... You know that you have what are called \"panic attacks\" See a doctor or counselor about getting them treated.

When you have a panic attack, your entire body is paralyzed, thoughts race, and you feel that death is certain. Listening to this song I can totally relate, panic attacks are one of the scariest things anyone can go through, and, like in the song, \"Warning signs never show.\" Whichever member of DT wrote this probably has experienced a panic attack at some point because physically and mentally, it is incredibly traumatizing and, like Dawgzy said, if you have never experienced one, you have no idea just how incredibly intense and unpredictable they are.

You're pumped with adrenaline when undergoing an attack. As if in a kill or be killed situation. fight for your life, or flee for it. [usually happens when nothing is wrong]\n\r\nOther symptoms include heart palpations fear of sleep. you become a horrible hypochondriac, and it literally feels impossible to break the cycle. no matter what remedy you try[minus medication, which im personally against]-it follows you like a ball and chain that's fused into your leg.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_26": "\nPretty obvious.
