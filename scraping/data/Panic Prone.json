Your other choice is to plead silence, the weaker choice of accepting the status quo and doing nothing at the cost of happiness.\n\r\nSome corrections.

For instance, We've all seen bums out beggin' for money before, and we all know that 90% want beer or drugs. Do you not give them money, knowing that you probably are keeping them for buying more drugs or booze, or do you loan them the cash, knowing that you might be helping them out of a jam? My personal solution is to say,\"Hey, you hungry? I don't have any cash but I'll take to McDonalds and buy ya something. Jump in.\" That way, if they really want food, they'll come, if they want money to buy jumk, they won't. Of Course, being a male in good shape and having a concealed weapons permit pretty eliminates any worries about being raped or anything like that. No, I'm kidding. The point is, is it our our duty to judge others, or to just give willingly, regardless. Anyway, read through the lyrics with this frame of mind, and I'm sure you'll make the connections.

This person apologizes and makes promises that are broken immediately afterward because of their problem, and they feel guilty about their weaknesses. Basically the other person is telling them to face their issues with dignity and to try to change. At least, that's how I see it. It may be wrong.\n\r\nMy eyes just melt when I listen to this song, it's so beautiful! I LOVE Chevelle, the geniuses!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_52": "\nI look at this song differently. I think this song is about a person is too nice and hurts himself because of it, or a pushover. Reminds me a lot of my brother. \n\n-The first verse is talking about someone asking the pushover for money knowing he'll \"give in again\" and Pete's like \"the bastard\" like get it together man, you \"can't keep refusing rights\". Everyone has rights over what they're willing to do, and the pushover just gives up to others pleas too easily. Pete says \"so he'll loan the cash/ but the sin is on the hands of you\". He's talking to the person that got the money out of his friend and he's like you know you just used someone you douche.\n-In the chorus, \"weak hands are calling\" is a reference to the people who ask things from you. Pete says \"plead silence\" and don't give in basically.\n-second verse is kinda self explanatory, kind of confusing to the rest of song (unusual for Chevelle)\n-the bridge is saying stop living your life with so many rules. don't listen to what others tell you and only care about yourself and what makes you happy.\nRead more at songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858509027/\n\n\n", "comment_53": "\nI think this is about someone who sees these people or a person who need help \"weak hands are calling\". \n\n\"Can't keep refusing rights, so he'll lend the cash\" - He feels he has to help them, because they are human beings and he feels they have the right as any other human being does to not have to live maybe without food, water, shelter.  Things like that.  And so, he lends them the money to get on their feet.\n\n\"But the sin is on the hands of you,\" - He is now partially responsible for whatever this person or people do with the money he lent.  Do they use it to feed a substance abuse habit? This is what I think \"sin\" refers to.\n\n\"So to care or plead silence,\" - Do you continue to care and \"help\" someone who just keeps feeding their habit or do you \"plead silence,\" meaning you do nothing?\n\n\"It won't change an empty stare,\" - To me this indicates the money won't help get the person or people on track with their life/lives because they only use the money to feed their habit.  Possibly \"an empty stare\" means someone who isn't in their right mind, they aren't completely there.  Maybe because they are taking drugs?\n\n\"These images hauntingly looks like hell,\" -  The man is obviously disturbed by what he is seeing.  People or a person addicted to drugs can really let themselves go when all they are concerned with is getting the next high or what not.  That's no life for them, and this person realizes that and is haunted by it.\n\nThe person is stuck between the decision to help or not.  If he helps, he knows the people or person will just give in to their habit.  If he doesn't, he continues to be haunted by these images.  So, he is very panicky over this and often thinks about it.  \n\nI also think this could be attributed to a larger scale interpretation.  For instance, could the main person represent the government?  Just a thought, but this could go into controversial conversations, so I'll leave it at that.  But, what a great song!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_54": "\nGreat song musically. I think this song means if one person is panicing about the consequences it can pull out to be, that they are all handing it to you and blaming you for it. If that makes since at all.. I guess they're not a Christian band anymore.. \"the bastard\" really shocked me.. o well i still like them.. haha\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_55": "\nEach of the brothers is a Christian, but dont spoonfeed me some crap about the word bastard. They could say F*ck for all i care, that doesnt change faith in the least bit. I don't see any war references at all. And besides that, Chevelle is a musical group. Sure they may kick major ass, but they are a musical group and that is all. You shouldnt let their political views form the basis of yours because they lead a completely different lifestyle. GWB is an honorable man, and Maynard keenan can go to hell for all i care, because Manson and him are both perfect examples of why politics should not mix with music.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
