I feel bad for Mikey, panic attacks must be awful to go through. \r\nAnyways, I love the intro, and the lyrics, and the song in general. It's one of my favorite songs on Insomniac. \r\nWhenever I listen to it, I can imagine what it feels like to just start freaking out for no reason. It's a scary song, but very...honest? \r\nGreat song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nPanic attacks are horrible....I've been wanting to write a song forever about mine...but havent gotten around to it, this song sums it up baiscly...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_19": "\npeople say that panic song , armatage shanks , and basket case were all about billie joe but panic song was about mike's problem with panic attacks, basket case was about billie joe, and armatage shanks was about toilets which doesn't make sense\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_20": "\nI know exactly what this song means. It's about being strung out on speed. They don't care about the world, but more on their situation of being high. \"Broken glass inside my head\" refers to the ice. They panic because they don't wanna die but also  just feel like jumping out of their lives and getting it all over with. The lyric is \"I wanna jump out\".

I see it more like it was written during a panic attack while being depressed and nihilistic.  He's feeling a void in his life.  It may have been induced by drugs in a way, but the feelings he talks about are not exclusive to drug users.  Plus, the motivation to even take drugs was caused by something else in his past.  Possibly the loss of his father and alienation elsewhere that he's experienced.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_23": "\nyeah yeah, I totally agree with you WeNeedTheEggs. It's not all about drugs, but more about panic attacks and shit like that. I think maybe it's not about drugs at all.\n\r\nand Green Day Girl, I know it's none of my business, but panic at the disco sucks big time. why don't you start listening to music that has even remotely something to do with punk.

I've been searching forever for the lyrics to \"Panic Song\" (i always look up the lyrics before i decide if i'm gonna download a song. can't help it. i'm weird). I really wanted to see the lyrics to this song because i read that this song was the inspiration to the name of the band \"Panic! at the Disco\" and i'm starting to like Panic! at the Disco. When i heard that they got their inspiration for the name from this song i freaked out because Green Day is my favorite band.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
