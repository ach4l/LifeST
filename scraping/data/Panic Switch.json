And, hello guys, a song can have multiple meanins at once. So yes, it's about the music industry, I see that. It's ALSO definitely about an anxiety attack. But put the pieces together, and you get a song that's about a guy's anxiety towards being an individual. This song is about how everyone's becoming the same, not just the music industry, but society in general. The \"speaker\" in this song is panicking because he feels like he needs to conform, but really doesn't want to. He values his individuality and is freaking out about how to keep it.\n\r\nAND THE CHORUS IS WRONG.AH.\r\n\"Do you see yourself in a crowded room?         \r\nDo your fingers itch?

It about dealing with the unknowns, uncertainty, and doubt that follow when things you thought you knew reveal themselves to not be true. \n\nThe individual knows that to heal they need to put aside time to work through what has happened, but doing so may require them to revisit painful events and discover other things they don't want to know. So instead, the individual tries to go on living their life and stay busy with work and other activities. But the fear & hurt from the unresolved issues are always right below the surface, leaving them in a perpetual state of anxiety and panic.\n\nThe individual may have been in a very intense, but probably unhealthy, relationship with someone whome they cared for alot. Over time the relationship likely experienced increasing amounts of betrayal of trust such as infidelity and perhaps abuse. While the individual was the recipient of these betrayals early on, he was submissive and may have made excuses which justified the the actions of his partner. But as the relationship escalated his emotions eventually got the best of him and he himself ended fighting back and contributing to the toxicty of the relationship in ways he never thought were possible.\n\nNow that the relationship is over, he can't ignore the fact that the relationship has changed him. His ideas of what is \"normal\" and what is \"right or wrong\" have shifted, but not in the way he'd like. He wonders if he can still be the person he always wanted to be? Or is he now as damaged as his previous partner? Will he be able to control this newly discovered side of himself which seems to be triggered so easily now, or is he destined to repeat the cycle of toxity in his future relationships.

When you have anxiety and panic attacks, trying to fall asleep at night can be difficult and anxiety inducing itself, so you end up lying awake and you could literally be staring at the moon all night.... moon or blue shine fits for this since the moon can give off a blue glow.\n\r\nIn the next lines about the white noise and being what someone wants him to be, he's worrying about something, maybe conforming, and it's keeping him awake. \n\r\nThe whole part leading up to \"Can you fall asleep with a panic switch\" sort of describes a person's physical reaction to anxiety... itchy fingers, feeling beaten down, etc. \n\r\nI think the next part about the pink slip is either an extremely elaborate metaphor about trying to let the anxiety take hold (like a pink slip to let it in) while attempting to overpower it (burn skin and brand what was once mine -- maybe get myself back to where I once was, claim myself again), OR it's just another anxiety inducing dilemma and he's thinking about a girl that he tried to be with and it ended up not working out. I like to think it's about an inner struggle to get back his sanity, but you never know! He does say \"she\"...\n\r\nThe end \"waiting and fading and floating away\" sort of lends itself to either scenario.

At least thats what i think of it\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_40": "\nI don't know what version of the song this is, but in the one I'm listening to, he never once says \r\n\"movements are made slow motion in frame \r\ni'm waiting and fading and floating away \r\nthe curtains are torn and the setting decayed \r\ni'm waiting and fading and floating...\"\r\nHe only says \"waiting and fading and floating away\" four times.\r\nSo what the heck???\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_41": "\nLike the band, although I have yet to hear every track. This one makes me think of an anxiety attack. Some people are uncomfortable in crowds, especially around strangers. And others are downright frightened to death. Cannot relate on a personal level, but I've had friends who don't do well out of their comfort zones (which includes only those they know well). Good song...creative.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_42": "\nI'm not sure the full meaning of the song yet, but it definitely is a criticism of politicians. The song was recently accidentally played during a Mitt Romney speech and Brian (the frontman) said that \"the irony was too good. While he is inadvertently playing a song that describes his whole campaign, we doubt that \u00e2\u0080\u0098Panic Switch\u00e2\u0080\u0099 really sends the message he intends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe song makes reference to political motifs, like \"blue shine\" \"red views\" and \"sleep on the right side\". I also think \"panic switch\" references the nuclear codes. \n\nCan anyone else extrapolate further on these ideas?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_43": "\nAlthough he says \"you\" a few times I don't feel like the song is directed at anyone in particular, more maybe society in general.\nTo me this song is about feeling invisible and the anxiety that comes with that feeling. In the chorus I picture the singer, or me, standing in a room, going unnoticed. You get that itch that you just want to scream, remind everyone you're there. I'm not sure if the line is \"do you think she'll sleep with a panic switch?\" but if it is, the \"she\" may refer to the anxiety in the same way a boat or car might be referred to as a \"she\". In this case it's like the anxiety is a different person, maybe because they have to hide it from the world.\nI love the build up to the second \"i'm waiting and fading...\" It feels like this is the breaking point and he just wants to disappear and forget.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_44": "\nI'm glad everyone here is as confused as I am. I came here afraid that if I learned the true meaning, it might ruin the song for me. Now I'll just have to be satisfied with the vague images of mounting panic that play in my head while I listen.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_45": "\nI agree with the anxiety, matrix connection, and he does include a female relationship in there. I think the music business industry connection is overrated, but I'm sure the band 'making it' into the big time and all the stress to perform that goes with, is mentioned  in the song a little. (use of the word 'scene' for example) This is why it's fitting that it's the song in Sucker Punch trailer, it's about mental desperation. \n\r\nHere is my explanation, which is tied to it's use in the Sucker Punch trailer.\nyoutube.com/\u2026\n\r\nps\r\n'wanna burn skin and brand what once was mine\"\r\nMeans that he is losing connection to a woman, which he identifies primarily through her body, in sex. (pink slip = vagina) And he wants to 'brand' as in burn his seal of ownership on her skin so she can't escape him, like cattle.\n\r\nAnd the first verse means the following. Kevin hit the nail on head with a few of the lines.\r\nTime \r\nIt's never worth my time \r\nBlue shine \r\nBleeds into my eyes \n\r\nI still \r\nSleep on the right side \r\nOf the white noise \r\nCan't leave the scene behind \n\r\nCould I be anything you want me to be \r\nIts always meant to be seen\r\n----------------------------\n\r\nWe have 'When the levee breaks' a classic hardcore song, Led Zepelin probably gave Snyder and this film their stamp of approval because they hardly ever allow anyone to use their songs, especially for trailers. \n\r\nThis plays during Baby Doll enters the asylum. Her levee's gonna break, lol. \nyoutube.com/\u2026 \r\nRead the lyrics they're great. \n\r\nThen later Baby Doll in the trailer enters her fantasy worlds, and Silversun Pickups - Panic Switch begins to play. youtube.com/\u2026 \n\r\n\"when you see yourself in a crowded room \r\ndo your fingers itch are you pistol whipped \r\nwill you step in line or release the glitch \r\ncan you fall asleep with a panic switch\" \n\r\nThe song is about a man being assailed (pistol whipped \"fingers itch\" = anger, your fist clenching into a fist or pulling a trigger) by the world/society/others and whether he has the strength to become numb and indifferent to the world and enter ones internal fantasy world, but still possess the faith that he will still be able to wakeup, when it's time.That's what \r\n\"can you fall asleep with a panic switch\" means.\n\r\n\"do you think she'll sleep with a panic...\" \n\r\nHe is also concerned whether his lover will be doing that also. If she also becomes introverted and indiferent to protect herself, he stands the possibility of losing her. Since they would both be asleep and as such would find it more difficult to wake each other up if they are in trouble.\n\r\n\"I'll try to hold on tight tonight \r\npink slip inviting me inside \r\nwant to burn skin and brand what once was mine \r\nbut the red views keep ripping the divide \r\nif i go everywhere you want me to go \r\nhow will i know you'll still follow?\" \n\r\nActivating the 'glitch' (apt name for Baby Doll's mental illness) or trading the social/external world for the inner/fantasy world is fraught with peril. And even though his female lover holds him to the social/external world, she eggs him on to go further inside fantasy, because that's where she is now. And he fears he will lose her, as he has lost the connection through her body. \n\r\nThis presumes 'it's pink slip' and not 'big slip', which would mean the verse is referring to the record industry.\n\r\n\"movements are made slow motion in frame \r\ni'm waiting and fading and floating away \r\nthe curtains are torn and the setting decayed \r\ni'm waiting and fading and floating... \n\r\ni'm waiting and fading and floating away \r\ni'm waiting and fading and floating away \r\ni'm waiting and fading and floating away \r\nwaiting and fading \r\nwaiting and fading\" \n\r\nAnd then we have the ending, which symbolizes not only physical life, but also inner passion and feeling. The songwriter using the well known metaphor of life as a stage only here it has decayed. This could also be read as referring to his life as a artist who produces music. Something epic happens \"movements are made slow motion in frame\", in Snyder slow motion no doubt, and now awakened his world and body has decayed, and he is done/finished. When he says \"I'm waiting and fading and floating away\" it means that he has become trapped in thought/life and is waiting for his death, the 'panic switch' didn't work, his faith that he would use the panic switch at the right time, was ill founded. And the consequence is a slow physical and symbolic death. \n\r\nThis adds a tragic, desperate, Armageddon/annihilative tone to the end of the trailer. \n\n\n\n", "comment_46": "\nLove this song, it's so well written.\n\r\nI've always had the impression this song was about social anxiety, which is something I struggle with constantly. I can identify with it and that makes it all the more powerful to me. The Chorus, in particular. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_47": "\n. While I will admit to being new to Silversun Pickups and thereby I don't know the context for this piece, i do have a few thoguhts.\r\nThis song feels like the parioid trapped feeling that social anxiety provokes. There is a wild sense of panic when you're surrounded by a croud and cannot find the exit especaly when you're trying to keep tabs on someone else and you lose them . The panic swich is the escape drug, whatever it is makes it hard to sleep. Alternatly, this drug feels wrong to him,  and buggs his conscience, making it hard to sleep..\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_48": "\nIm agree about the social anxity disorder. I've suffered from it for years and every time i hear this song it reminds me of my struggles.\n\r\n\" when you see yourself in a crowded room\r\ndo your fingers itch are you pistol whipped\r\nwill you step in line or release the glitch\r\ncan you fall asleep with a panic switch\" \n\r\n\" do your fingers itch,are you pistol whipped\" itching,is often an anxious habit. I often freeze in large crowds,for at least a moment. When you have social anxity a lot of it comes from fear of being judged..at least for me. So will you step in line and act like the rest or release your glitch the one of anxity or whatever else you fear of being judged by.\n\r\nFor many you also have an overwhelming fear of abandonment.  \"If I go everywhere you want me to go\r\nHow will I know you'll still follow?\" \n\r\nFear of social judgement falls in with this line too \"Could I be anything you want me to be \r\nIf so is it meant to be seen\"\n\r\nI dont need any scrutinization on what i post here..This is just my idea.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_49": "\nI'm leaning towards the Anxiety Attack scenario and someone trying to control their own \"fight or flight\" instincts.  I've never experienced an AA but I have enjoyed the surge of adrenalin that kicks in when it's time to take action during an emergent situation, as a Firefighter and Police Officer.\n\r\nThe bass line is hypnotic in this song and the hook is memorable enough to require it to be played several times until you're sick of it for a while.\n\r\nAs for the term \"Panic Switch\". I though that meant the feeling one gets on a occasion when you are about to drift off to sleep, only to be shocked by a sudden twitch that feels like your whole body just shook, but it leaves you just as quickly.  When working a 24 hour shift at the fire station and trying to get some rest, it was common to have to bolt straight awake and jump into action. From Zero to Chaos in a split second. \n\r\nWhat a rush!  (just like this song)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
