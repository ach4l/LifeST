{"comment_0": "\nThe song was written in response to Steve Wright (Radio 1 DJ) playing Wham I'm your Man after the lunchtime \"Newsbeat\" which went out at 1230-1250 on Radio One.  I recollect it was a Monday around April 1986.  Apparently both Marr and Morrissey were appalled to hear Steve Wright report the Chernobyl disaster on the radio and then follow it by playing the Wham song and in an interview with NME in 1987, Marr says:\n\r\n\"'Panic' came about at the time of Chernobyl. Morrissey and myself were listening to a Newsbeat radio report about it. The story about this shocking disaster comes to an end and then, immediately, we're off into Wham!'s 'I'm Your Man'. I remember actually saying 'what the fuck has this got to do with peoples' lives?' We hear about Chernobyl, then, seconds later, we're expected to be jumping around to 'I'm Your Man'.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nAfter listening to the news of the Chernobyl disaster on Radio 1, Wham's 'I'm Your Man' was played immediatly after. Morrissey wrote this song, criticisng the 'pop' music that was around at this time as he was disgusted in what he heard. I felt for a while that 'The music that they constantly play, it says nothing to me about my life', but you learn to let that go. I hardly listen to the radio and very few new artists interest me at the moment. The Smiths are a band that fascinate me and I don't think I will ever stop listening to their music. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nIm guessing the kids singing in the background is another reference to chernobyll? Anyway, this is what I love about the Smiths. Most people think the songs are just depressing but can't see the underlying humour and wit. \n\r\nChinup hit the nail bang on the head. The song is about, as well as chernobyll, music with no soul. Music that says nothing to you about your life. Miss chainsaws thing about dance music not using real instruments is a bit of a stupid thing to say seeing as a hell of a lot of people who make dance music are clasically trained artists. Download a song like Max Graham-gone or massive attack-unfinished sympathy and tell me they say nothing to you about your life. Obviously there is poppy dance too, but dance music speaks to me. Even if its not got lyrics it can conjour up memories, evoke emotions. Its about the passion. After all a room full of hundreds of people worshipping the music and sharing a feeling, or a kid at home spending all his money on records to play on his decks working towards playing his music to other people wouldnt be possible without the passion or if the music was made purely to sell records.  \n\r\nThese days the music this song Id consider applies to would be Pop trash and same old 50cent moaning about smashing peoples legs and bitches RNB and hip hop. But then not all hip hop is like that. Grandmaster Flash and the furious five, public enemy, even NWA all had something to say that was important. I guess what Im saying is that you can't just condemn a genre of music as being not \"real music.\" The thing that defines it is if the music can speak to people about something, be it political, emotional, whatever. Music that doesnt misses the point.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nnot positive but the dj in question was steve wright i think, it wasnt tony blackburn\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nIt's about Steve Wright's coverage of the Chernobyl disaster, right?

I'd argue there's no such thing.\r\nProper instruments?  I'll assume you're referring to the electric guitar and normal \"band\" instruments.  I'd like to remind you that the electric guitar was invented in the 30's and didn't become widely popular until the 50's.
