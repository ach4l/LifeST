{"comment_0": "\nThis whole album deals with spiritual enlightenment(with the climax at the end of Reflection). Parabola specifically deals with the illusory nature of the self.\n\n\"We barely remember who or what came before\" -> Our memories are very limited, but they create a story of our \"selves\" despite that. It's just an illusion, the song tells us to focus on the now(a common theme in spirituality) and that our bodies are just a temporary form of being.\n\nThe other songs on Lateralus all focus on different aspects of the main spiritual truth that Reflection tries to convey.\n\nThe Grudge/Schism are about our relationships with other beings and how futile it is to separate ourselves from them. We are, after all, all one mind.\n\nThe Patient/Ticks and Leeches are about dealing with the struggles that come along the path to spritual enlightenment. The incredible amount of patience it requires, the negative influences from the outside world, etc.\n\nLateralus is about the exploration of ourselves and just the general size and scope of what there is to discover.\n\nMany people call Tool hard to understand, but they actually convey very simple messages in their music. That's part of what makes them so great, their universal applicability to almost all situations.\n\nEven looking at their discogtaphy as a whole sort of shows a cool trend. Opiate was very \"me and them\", the ideas are very typical of an individual angry at society and at himself.\n\nUndertow and Aenima show a more inward approach, especially on Aenima. Third Eye is sort of like the precursor to Lateralus, the final understanding of truth.\n\nLateralus is sort of climax of their work.\n\n10,000 Days is sort of like Opiate, in that it includes lots of societal criticism, but from a new perspective. It criticizes it in terms of \"we\", rather than \"they.\"\n\nDo I really think Tool's discography is like one big concept album? No, but the trend is definitely there.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nWe don't remember what we were before we were alive in this physical form.  We choose to stay alive in this physical form.  It is a great gift to be alive.  We can look at all the other bodies around us and see that we are obviously not alone in this world.  Other's share our pain and our joy.  Just by being born we have an effect on the lives of other people.  But this body, this physical form, is only a vessel for our \"soul\".  Our soul is what makes us different from every other person.  It is my personal belief that our soul is the same thing as our mind.  Our body gives our soul a chance to experience life and what it means to be alive.  To have memories.  To love and to hate.  To feel pain and joy.  We have to remember that we are not a collection of memories.  We are not our professions.  We are not what others see when they look at us or even the way we try to project ourselves to the world.  Inside we are a mind truly capable of anything, but limited by the body we are given.  Even so, we should embrace this chance to be alive.  Our body will die.  Our soul will live on.  Of course this is all just hope.  But we need hope.  I need hope.  This body holding me can't be all that I am.  My mind can't be just a series of synaptic connections and chemical reactions.  There is more to us than science will ever even begin to explain.  I highly recommend the Ender's Game book series by Orson Scott Card for anybody who like's this song and want to read an excellent book that gets deeper into what we are and what makes us human.  Ending thought:  Try and empathize with people.  People act a certain way because their body is imperfect.  There is a reason for everything, nomatter how irrational.  Learn to love others nomatter how much they hate you.  It is hard.  I know.  Damn do I ever know.  I am imperfect, too.  I hope you all find happiness without sacrificing the happiness of anybody else.  Good tidings and Farewell.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song is about the Spiritualist belief in the birth process; it has nothing to do with sex really.  We are spirit forms until we will ourselves into a physical form.  During the infant stage, our spirit (or second self as I call it) moves in and out of our body with ease, as it's not yet grounded in the physical world.  The lyrics demand that we are alive because we chose to be, and we should cherish this opportunity.  Pain is truly not an illusion, but can be manipulated into suck when one looks at the big picture.  Our bodies are vehicles that carry our astral minds.  We are eternal.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThat or it could possibly be relating to death by suicide. The deep depression that some of us feel. That when the walls come down and we are left alone, there are only 2 options: end it now, or find hope and place faith in overcoming our insecurities. \"Pain is an illusion\", I know that statement has kept me here in this world. The thought of that statement gives me the strength to go through one more day. I remember that all that is physical, is ill-logical. It is only a destraction. I must stay focused on what my life is about. In the song right before this one on Tool's album Maynard asks, \"Is this a Test? It has to be. Otherwise I can't go on.\" To me that is what I feel when I hear it. It is the feeling of hope and inspiration, a chance to go on. But that's me.

The \"parable\" here is that \"we\", humans are an extension of our cosmic counterpart i.e. God. We are ALL one being and Life, is the experience of a divided single consciousness within human avatars. Meaning, we, all, us, god, CHOSE to \"divide\" and live! \"This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone\" Not alone meaning, life is many. Consciousness of ONE is alone.\r\nThe \"illusion\" is that there is NO DEATH! But only a constant cycle of infinite existence/consciousness.  \r\nDestroy the ego side and experience \"death\" of the \"self\" only to come back \"here\" and realize we are humans and ONLY this \"reality\" will end... Our fleshy vessels will retire... mortality. \"This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality. Embrace this moment. Remember; we are eternal, all this pain is an illusion.\" The \"moment\" being when you return to the consciousness of ONE, when the ego dies.\r\nThese men have experienced \"death\" of the ego as have I. I KNOW this is exactly what they are trying to convey... I hope you will consider what I have said and pay more attention to other lyrics from other songs.

It's a very positive song (just like most of their stuff). The song is about this miniscule moment in time that we as spirits have been actually placed into this world..onto this earth. The one thing that none of the \"gods\" have ever had the chance to do. To be mortal and eternal at the same time. In short, enjoy the ability to see, hear, smell, smile, love, etc...because it is only for a flicker in time that we get to do this. Do not be sad when something earthly seems to be troubling, it is only of this world and it isnt real, not in the grand scheme of things. It is a \"Holy\" moment, a gift, given to us by the Creator of all. Once this is realized it becomes more easily understood and appreciated.

DMT is a hallucinogen that occurs in the human brain, as well as in the brain of many other organisms including some plants.  The title \"Parabola\" refers to the very fast onset and consequent regression of the drug, and the lyrics \"hold on\", \"stay inside\", etc. refer to the spirit being launched out of the body during a DMT trip.  DMT usually causes intense colors and euphoria, along with meeting with spiritual beings that guide you along your journey.  If you want to know more about it I'm sure it's on the internet somewhere, and if you really want good information read \"DMT: The Spirit Molecule\" by Dr. Rick Strassman.  Truly insightful and interesting stuff especially considering that almost all trips have the same components.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nThis whole album is entirely comprised of therapy concepts, concepts used in counseling and therapy to help people keep from freaking out. This is not about sex, although that is what I thought it was about when I first heard it. The concept here is the practice of living RIGHT NOW, which is very hard. It is about the difficulty and the reward of not living entirely in the past and in the future. The idea is to live without your preconceptions and your hopes and projections ruining the wonder of the immediate world. Try it sometime, and you will see why it is worth writing songs about. The pain metioned is the anguish of always worrying about the past and the future. Those things are not happening right now, so any pain you are feeling from the past and the future is illusionary. It is only you. Crucify the ego, and you find that there is not much that is worrisome that is happening RIGHT NOW.

To me this song is about several things; sex, birth, rebirth, and the concept of life as we know it is only a temporary experience for our sole which we need to cherish.  \n\r\nFolks keep mentioning the Fibonacci sequence in attempting to understand TOOLs music.  The Fibonacci sequence is just a deep pattern within anything that is organic.  We see it visually through the golden mean or Rectangle which is evident throughout nature \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is the balance and rhythm of the universe.  In art we see what we instinctivelly find aesthetically pleaseing follows this balance and rhythm of nature \u00e2\u0080\u0094 same with music, and TOOL has just taken it to the next level \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this is why we cannot stop listening to it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is a hightened state of consiousness.   This all happens before you even begin to look at the lyrics and the meaning behind the songs.  \n\r\nThe human race has been going through almost a backwards evolution \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we have lost so many instincts that we only have a few instinctive aspects left and our culture and society suppress it more and more by providing us with blinders that keep us from seeing what is beyond our bodily experience.  Religion also does this, it creates a path with blinders that teaches us that we must follow their ways to become enlightened when infact it is all internal and GOD is \u00e2\u0080\u009cI Am\u00e2\u0080\u009d is within us all.  \n\r\nTalking about instincts, the few we have left, and one of the most prominent instincts which must continue for us to experience a journey in what is this and now, is the instinct of SEX.  Our culture is continuosly attempting to suppress this instinct.  Sex for some religions is viewed as a spiritual experience and can be used for meditation and enlightenment \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Through orgasm we reach a hittened state of conciousness for a brief moment, which is also a moment in which our body is closest to death.  \n\r\nConception is a mini version of the big bang.   For anyone who has children and has experienced the birth process, male or female, you will know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking.   A new born baby is the closest thing to that devine state of all knowing.  It is not as if you are looking down at  a helpless ignorant creature but rather the opposite \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is a state of the coming together of body and soul experiencing being alive.  \n\r\nThe line in the middle of Parabola where he screams \u00e2\u0080\u009cALIVE\u00e2\u0080\u009d is the apex of that realization and is almost this climax that takes it above and beyond.  \n\r\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure it has many other meaings as well \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is the beauty of art, it can have a main concept which is then supported with a variety of elements which to some may appear as random but instead are finely orchestrated to highten the experience. \n\r\nThe idea of loosing our instincts I believe is also related to our inability to experience this hightened consciousness which would allow us to find our instincts.  We see this in animals that still have their instincts intact, even dogs and cats.  They have the ability to communicate at an entirely different level.   \n\r\nTo survive as a species we must regain these instincts that allow us to live in harmony with our body, earth and universe.  \n\r\nBut hey, maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just crazy and all of this writting is just an illusion.  \n\r\nTool Fuckin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Rules!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nI see this song as one of true love.

This proportion is found all over nature: In bee hives, snail shells... even the human body. Phi was derived from the Fibonacci sequence - a progression famous not only because the sum of adjacent terms = the next term, but because    the quotients of adjacent terms possessed the property of approaching 1.618.\n\r\nA few examples: \r\n  In a honey bee community the female bees always outnumber the male bees. No matter what, in any beehive in the world if you divide the number of female bees by the male bees you always get 1.618... Phi. \r\nSea shells... the ratio of each spiral's diameter to the next = Phi.\r\nPine cone petals, leaf arrangement on plant stalks, insect segmentation... the human body.

To add to the comments a title tie-in that I have yet to see, a parabola as stated is a mathematical curve that has a U-shape. I believe this has quite a bit of significance in the song in a few different ways.\n\r\nThe first significance of it is to draw a comparison between the process the song describes in its entirety, the spirit taking a physical form. A parabola serves to represent this process, i.e. our spirit descends from the heavens, takes physical form eventually reaching a most solidified physical state, before again ascending to the heavens, essentially forming a parabolic curve.\n\r\nThe other potential significance of it stems from the first line: \"We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment\".\n\r\nI believe this to be in reference to our own first recognition of consciousness that typically occurs around the age of 4-6 yrs. of age. This \"awakening\" typically seems to be spontaneous, and we usually cannot truly remember anything before it. The word \"who\" in that line probably is in reference to a previous incarnation of your spirit.\n\r\nThe parabola shows represents the relationship between our spiritual presence in the physical world. The conception of consciousness occurs and we become generally more physically grounded over time reaching an apex before the process reverses as our spirit slowly leaves our body over time. In our old age our memory fades, our cognitive processes slow, etc... and the spiritualist belief is that this is caused by the spirit becoming tired of this world and trying to move elsewhere.\n\r\nThe last possible correlation I could draw between a parabola and the meaning of this song is our perception of time. It is said that the human perception of time speeds with age, which could be represented by half of a parabola. \n\r\nThat's my take, please continue to enjoy the fantastic works of Tool, whilst maintaining the search for further meaning as I'm sure more meaning than even what's listed here can be found in their lyrics. Maynard is a literal genius, both lyrically and intellectually and is a great example of a divergent thinker capable of inspiring divergent thought in others. Don't allow his influence to be dulled by the posits of text on the internet thinking that someone \"nailed\" the meaning.

Now, think of sex as what our mommies and daddies told us it is, a sign of love. Alrighty, now that that is set aside, on with the proof!\n\r\nThe first examples starts out with \"We are choosing to be here right now, hold on, stay inside\"\r\n-2 mutally loving to-be parents must want to be there.  They love eachother immensly, so they decicde to continue.\n\r\nNext- \"This holy reality \r\nThis holy experience, choosing to be here in \"\r\nThis line talks about how holy and great sex is, and how buetiful it is, and how it is only holy and wonderful if the 2 people want to do it.\n\r\n\"This body \r\nThis body holding me \r\nBe my reminder here that \r\nI am not alone \"\r\nI saw someone said that 'this body' is refering to the singer.  I beg to differ:  This body, this body holding me (the second line is very important!)  The singer is refering to his partner's body, that is holding and loving him.  This connection, this mutual acceftion reminds him that he is not alone.\n\r\n\"Feeling eternal, all this \r\nPain is an illusion \"-  That is hard for me to use on this interpritation, but i guess it might be refering to the climax?\n\r\nThen possibly, \r\nThe 2nd to last paragraph, like some other have said, refers to the child, and spending time with him/her.\n\r\nThe last one is probally refering to a hug with the child, and 'this body' this this child, and finally embrace life, and remeber that we are etrnal in memories.  \n\r\nnot a bad song, once i started to think about it, i liked it a lot more ^_^...\n\n\n", "comment_49": "\nwhat the fuck is this shit?^  Are these even real people talking?\r\nYo, kill me killroy, I think you're trying too hard to relate stuff together.

He's saying that he's choosing to stay here in this reality, but he knows that there's more after he dies.  Therefore any pain he experiences in his life really doesn't affect him because this pain is temporary like this body.  And I think that when he says \"This body holding me, Be my reminder here that, I am not alone in, This body\" I think he is simply saying that others are stuck here in their bodies too and many other people have thought of suicide but decided against it, so they are just like him.\n\r\n\"In this holy reality, In this holy experience\"  This is just refering to life on this planet.  It's a holy experience because a higher power or order has chosen this experience for the human mind to experience bodily sensation and emotions.  Maybe we have to live through this reality so that our mind or soul can appreciate the next step.  If you jump the gun and decide to kill yourself who knows what will happen, maybe your mind will simply dissipate because it was not ready to die, or maybe you will be reincarnated and have to start life all over.  I guess I've gotten a little off the topic but I have a tendancy to ramble when I write.

One of Tool's main objective (in my opinion) is to make people think, and be open minded and willing to suggestion, and they do that. When they first came out, they were very literal, and it seems, after Justin Chancellor took over on bass duties, Tool as a band got alot deeper in their music. Songs like \"H.\" and Forty-Six & 2  from the album \u00c3\u0086nima are incredible and mindblowing (you should read under their titles for meanings on them), Especially the closing track \"Third Eye.\" That song is the very song that inspired the rest of my life, I've changed so much since i first heard it. And now this song,Parabol(a), is to me the Third Eye of Lateralus. It really opened me up (brought me to tears a couple of times and i'm not ashamed to say it). It's just I guess their music touches a lot of people very deeply and spiritually. And its not for all people, in my opinion is over most peoples head, like the people who say Lateralus is their worst album, well to me it is their best work musically and lyrically, and i feel that it was over most of the fans heads. And the mathematical formulas come from the the fact that we want to learn what these songs are about. It's kinda hard to explain I've been rambling on for quite sometime and I probably haven't answered your question.

By watching the video, you'll just get more confused (as with all TOOL videos) but the video for Parabola is actually a little easier to decipher than most of the others. Well it is to me at least. \n\r\nYou see i have this theory that some TOOL songs have been inspired someway by the work of Carl Jung and other thinkers. In Jung's middle age he began reading Gnostic texts and myself being influenced/guided by Jung (some would say i have no idea what to think, so i am hearded towards Jung, Frued, Nietsche, Goethe ect. like the sheep i am) So i began to read some stuff on Gnosticism.\n\r\nThe first book i read gave a brief overview of what Gnosticism is and all that and my small understanding goes like this: \n\r\nWe are all here on this Earth not because it is God's will, but because we are God's mistake (no, i'm not a religeous freak before you ask). Inside everyone there lies two spiritual beings, one male one female. This is a reference back to Jung's work on the Anima and Animus. When we have achieved Gnosis (knowledge), our spirits emerge from our bodies (\"This body holding me\") and ascend to a higher plain of being. This belief system doesn't need a church, or a priest, or anything else that can fall victim to dogma, and that is why Gnosticism is such a little known religeon.\n\r\nSo i think the last part of the clip is a mention of Gnosticism. Two beings (the eyes, one pink one blue) travel throughout the body and reach the chest where the spirit is released. The body eventualy disintergrates and becomes a bright white glowing sphere.\n\r\nBut the rest of the clip still has me stumped. especially the Parabol start with the three guys and the black vomit. And the Star of David really throws up some new stuff in there. I don't think anyone will ever decipher any tool song/clip...except for 'hush' maybe. But the video clip can bring in another dimension of confusion for fans...thanks again Maynard, like you havn't screwed with our heads enough already\n\n\n", "comment_76": "\nI'm willing to bet large sums of cash that Harry has came listening to TOOL.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_77": "\nI'm willing to bet large sums of cash that Harry has came listening to TOOL.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_78": "\nyou guys are all idiots this song is obviously about appreciating and acknowledging the fact that we are alive, and that we are not alone in this world, wheather you are refering to other humans, or other unknown beings. all you have to do is read the lyrics to get that\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_79": "\nOn the song side of things, cherishing life and all of that that's been said already basically sums that up.

This song was written purely about Astral Projection.  It is a meditation technique used to have your soul leave your body and project itself into the astral world, and awa from the physical world. One of the pre-projection techiniques requests you to relax 100%, and feel the energy flow up through your feet, and pass all the chakra's, until it reaches your head, then you will be able to leave your physical self. The chakras are loated betwwen the genitals and the anal, right below the belly button, about 5 inches above the belly button, next to the heart, in the throat, and, the most important chakra, is the Third Eye, which is the chakra that you can actually feel open wide and feel yourself become more creative and origianal. As you feel the energy flowing through you, as it passes each chakra, you must feel the chakra open up and release more energy, to add as it flows upward through your body, when the third eye opens, all your energy is released at the final chakra, on the top of your head. This song is about wanting to be able to stay in the astral dimension, and not to return to the phyisical, by seeing that after we die, we go to astral, and we are eternal, all this pain is an illusion, i am not alone in this body holding me. pry open your third eye.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_115": "\nI agree with whiteout completly.  i know everybody is entitled to their opinion but some of your opinions about sex and his son are just kinda out of it.  astral fits this song completly...and parabol too in that matter. open your third eye people and completly understand tool.\nastralvoyage.com\n\n\n", "comment_116": "\ni dont know if any of you have ever eaten shrooms. but if you do, and i mean a good bit, and you have one of those introspective trips...you're basically living in this songs. you just feel like you're existing in the time before you were born. just sitting there with your soul and the truth. eat some shrooms and you'll know what the hell im talking about, and what maynard's talking about too. and please dont yell at my post unless you've tried it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_117": "\namazing song! as are all tool songs. i really like this song alot! one of tools best (if its even possible to pick a \"best\", since every single one of tool's songs are great) any way incase you didnt know a parabola is a math figure shall we say that is symetrical and kinda looks like a U. anyway since its symetrical both sides are equal. i think this song is about having 2 parts to your life. the life with your body, and the other life being your spiritual life. the line \"Feeling eternal, all this Pain is an illusion\" i think maynard (the king) is trying to say that in the end we are all eternal and the pain that we feel in life isnt really real because it will soon go away and we will have no pain. anyway thats just my take on the song and i know everyone has there own interpritation. so if you agree with what i just said then awsome but if you dont thats fine too. later. long live tool! \n\n\n", "comment_118": "\nAll of you may find this interesting...the origin of the song title...which we all know by now has much to do with the meaning of each TOOL song.  Think.  TOOL cleverly imposed several literary devices in the title alone.  Instead of using the word \"parable,\" they used the word \"parabol,\" which is the precursor to the fully spelled word \"parabola.\"  This is TOOL pointing to the melodic flow of the prologue, \"parabol,\" transitioning into the crux of their message \"parabola,\" demonstrating that, in fact, these are one in the same song on two different tracks.  Yet, these tracks are seperated for the reason of illustrating a radical difference in time and space, much like the process of being reborn, but not in a physical sense, of course (spiritually--and not a religious spirituality either, but rather, a spirituality which purely reflects the essence and innocence of a child, never taking for granted every precious moment that he experiences.  This, in itself, becomes a religion, the unadulterated morality and justice of a child's viewpoint, not influenced by the world and its shortcomings, but by unconditional love and respect for all things good and a naivete of those things not worthy of recognizing in the first place).  This allusion to rebirth helps us recognize that who and where we are in life right now is not so bad.  We have the ability to change for the better at all times and to look to the brighter.  We have the opportunity to never take for granted every passing moment.  We have to the chance to turn our grudges into gold, to learn from them while letting them go and being forgiving.  We can know, once again, what it's like to be like a child, light and innocent.  We need to feed our will to feel our moment, which is right now.  Now is the moment to turn things around.  Your reality is a holy reality, if only you can recognize this.  Your life is good, no matter how bad it is.  Just the fact that you're alive should be enough.  TOOL weaves this message into the song title with their choice of diction.  The full name of the complete song is parabol parabola, or \"parable parabola.\"  A parable is a fable, a short story or song meant to teach a moral or lesson, but with a twist that forces the listener think.  This twist takes something apparently obvious and turns it on its head, demonstrating that what's just, or right, is not always so obvious after all.  A parabola is half of an elipse, most commonly perceived as a U-shaped figure, or horseshoe-looking shape.  A parable parabola is a parable which illustrates that while you may think life centers itself around the lows like a U-shaped figure does, life actually centers itself around the ups and the highs (the good things) like an inverted U-shaped figure would reveal, a paramount or pinacle.  The action of turning the pabola on its head to illustrate this point perfectly demonstrates the underlying theme of the song, that life is not on the whole bad, but rather that life is wonderful on the whole.  We should, like children, put whats bad behind us and move on joyously, with arms open to embrace the random, arms open to embrace whatever may come.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_119": "\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Now I am in no way trying to preach Christianity or some other religion.  I just think that we should all search for something deeper within ourselves.  To make that connection with our spirit.  The biggest flaw I can see in America is in our secular culture.  Because we dissect so many aspects of our lives we are so prone to \"multiple personalities.\"  I've seen it in so many others, and even myself.  One moment you're happy, the next you flip out on something.\n\r\nBut Anyway, look at mathematics.  It is a very defining subject that seems to go no where.  Okay, yeah, I know x^2 is a Parabola, but what is it for?  What does math do for you?  Even my instructors would admit that there hasn't been too many breakthroughs in math.  But it's simply because the barrier we put on ourselves by segmenting every little thing we find.\n\r\nThis is where tool comes in.  They take a simple curve, one that we all remember from our classes, and take it to new heights by applying the rule to our life.  Think about it, x^2 cannot be proven that it's anything but a parabola.  It's solid, it's a law.  Well, take that bit farther.  For the farther you climb, the more you bleed, the harder you work (all relative to you of course since everyone's opinion differs on the level of work) -- basically the higher you raise yourself the better your life will be (signified by the easy climb down on the otherside of the curve).  \n\r\nNow I am still looking for that pivotal point.  That time in my life (signified by the peak of the curve) where I think the song is mostly talking about.  When you no longer are wishy washy about the things in your life and what you believe in.  When you finally reach that point and say, \"now I know I will be truly happy.\"  I can't wait to reach that!  When your pain just washes away because of the love you find.  And all your pain and suffering, your childhood fears and fixations are released.  When you feel this holy experience and realize how eternal you are.  And how much you are truly loved.\n\r\nTo all the Tool fans out there, I love you!  And even if you aren't one, I love you anyway!  Because we all need to get back to ourselves and each other.

A parable is not necessarily a bible story, but any didactic short story. Didactic literature is any piece that is meant to teach people how to live their lives. Bible stories are didactic. The Bhagavad Gita is didactic. I agree with the idea that the parabola is a representation of life. I don't agree with the whole astral projection thing. I think he's just talking about holding his lover in his arms. Do you guys remember your first girlfriend? Think back on the moment you held her in your arms for the first time. Have you guys ever been in love? Existentialist philosophy, especially according to Dostoyevsky (read Crime and Punishment) elevates love as the pinnacle of human experience. The world may suck, but its okay cuz there's love. And when you hold your lover in your arms the rest of the world fades away...and you're left in nirvana. \n\r\nDon't take my word for it...I'm no English major. \n\r\nI can't reconcile this interpretation with the video...but they're supposed to be seperate entities telling seperate stories (I think....I read that on some website.)

This box represents the majority of people's boxed up and controlled view of reality.  At the beginning of the video, where we see all those clusters floating in space, this shows us the separation amongst human beings (ego-games) and society (religion, and dualism when viewing God as a separate entity).  These little clusters floating in space also look mechanically devised, because that is what America is all about, right?  Keeping it's people separate, controlled.\n\r\nLater on in the video we see a black man who is inside of this room.  Again this room represents his limited view of reality and awareness.  He only has a slight concept of nature because of the window in the room he can look out of.  He decides to enter nature, out of his ego, out of the confines of his mind.  \n\r\nHe becomes free of his mind, free of the illusion the machine created for him (I think the floating ball represents society, fear, the illusion society created for him).  When Alex Grey's art enters the video, the man experiences a kundalini awakening and enters the infinite, the oneness.  He becomes aware of everything all at once, hence the eyes everywhere.  Because we are all God, God is everything, we are everything.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_187": "\nI must also add that the end shows oneness.

Think about it, all that we ever possess is in reality is only rented because once we die, it just goes to someone else.\n\r\nThat God that so many people want to meet when they die, is actually residing in our body (reminding me that I am not alone) and there for instant access, but only when we are able to recognise it as exactly that.  Our ego is the \"devil\" that challenges us and tempts us to not take up that challenge of seeking divinity within ourselves.\n\r\nYou guys should check out an amazing lady called Marion Woodman - she described an incredible experience of, after many years of hating being a woman, starving herself and all kinds of self inflicting hatred, being near death with disease and havng an OBE.  Once floating on the ceiling looking down at her pathetic body she thought \"finally, I am free of you, you stupid body\" and she actually tried to kick it in hatred!  Then she looked at this poor faithful thing lying there, hardly breathing, waiting paitently for its 'master' to return and live with it in unision, and she describes an overwhelming compassion and love that she never felt before.  It was only then that she realised that our body is a vehicle that assists in completing those necessary tasks, paths and acts that help us and humanit as a whole move towards the great unkown.  She chose to go back to it, and look after it... to respect it for what it is - a divine vehicle or \"tool\" that we should never take for granted.

Then the end where it says \"Embrace this moment, remember: we are eternal, all this pain is an illusion\" is about the crucifixion.  That would explain why Parabol is called Parabol.

When interpreting songs like this, I like to look at a very vague concept that could relate to the song and break it down until I have the broadest meaning possible that is still directly related and then look at the parts separately. While Maynard has written songs that only have one meaning and some that are a lot less convoluted than this, I feel this one and a lot of his other songs are MEANT to have a broad meaning that can be interpreted it many different ways.\n\r\nAnyway, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my two cents.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_214": "\ni love the outro of this. it's playing with my brain. awesome.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_215": "\ni think this song is about how our life is a sacred gift, our eternal souls have on chance to live mortal lives, to feel pain, pleasue, love and hate and all other emotions, and to learn to recognise what is good and before we die and we enter our eternal dimension in which we all live as one entity\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_216": "\ny = ax^2 + bx + c\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_217": "\nWell, the other day I saw the video for the very first time.

Im not saying thats the full meaning behind lateralus however the spiral is refering to the \"polar unity spiral\" seen during LSD trips.

If you look at the lyrics you will see that it is most likely about our (humans) current reality, and our consciousness. I think MJK is trying to say that we as humans are choosing to be here (earth) and all the pain that we suffer here on this earth is really just an illusion. Its almost like the idea of the Matrix. We percieve the world in our own manner, unfortunately we have chosen to make this world a reality in which we suffer pain and chaos.\r\nOn another note, Maynard claims that his body is holding him and that he is not alone. His body is proof that there is something inside of him. Possibly a soul? im not sure what his beliefs are, but the body acts as a chamber. When the body dies, he will be released and will exist eternally. \r\nThe ultimate message in this song is to state that we should recognize this chance we have created on earth. The chance to be alive and to be breathing. In the song Lateralus, MJK also touches upon this towards the end of the song. This is where he gives specifics on what he enjoys most. That he embraces the moments to do many things and most importantly to be human.\r\nThats my take.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_241": "\nTHERE IS NO FREAKIN SPOON MAN!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_242": "\nTHIS SONG IS ONE OUR GREATEST GIFTS, NO ETERNAL REWARD WILL FORGIVE US NOW 4 WASTING THE DAWN\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_243": "\nCaps lock off, dear.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_244": "\nhell n my head, what the fuck man?\r\nthat's poetic, but what the fuck could a sentence like that mean\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_245": "\nThe eternal reward won't forive us, apparently. >.>\r\nEither that or he had a spasm when he touched the keyboard and he came out with that crap.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_246": "\nPoetry is inherently cryptic as well as frequently drug induced.

The lines shift into a different direction once it becomes Parabola. I feel the meaning is now life and the struggles of it all up until the final verse. He mentions that \"this pain is an illusion\"  as if it will eventually leave us all and we and the rest of the world will end. The last verse ties it all up, and he has wasted too much time on simple little Earth and is taking his descent/ascent into someplace new and beautiful, whatever his believes is beyond in Heaven or Hell or \"what came before.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_262": "\nI really love this song and I really like how Parabol joins so smoothly into this.

Like how a television picks up various frequencies depending on how it is \"tuned,\" our bodies are \"tuned\" by nature only to the realm of certain mid-frequency sounds and visible light.  All around us are x-rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet rays, infrared waves, vast innumerable examples of electromagnetic energy outside of our \"frequency range.\"\n\r\nIcke, and clearly Maynard, share the idea that life is an illusion of vibrational energy, of which our spirit or consciousness, specifically relating to the emotion or state of being \"love,\" is the only truly important component to the Universe.\n\r\nThis song, and this message, is the single most important thing anyone needs to know.\n\r\nNamaste.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_292": "\nI think that this song is much more about life and the strenght, once we are pure human beings.

Your basic Romeo and Juliet Dilema. Here is why:\n\r\n\"We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment\" = Nothing that led up to those moments of happiness matters anymore.\n\r\n\"We are choosing to be here right now\" = Choose to enjoy that moment of happiness and do not live inside the world that threatens it.\n\r\n\"Hold on, stay inside this holy reality\"= Escape into the world that feels so wonderful, despite its frailty.\n\r\n\"This body holding me\"= Be held by each other, not the cynics that want to tear the two apart.\n\r\n\"Be my reminder here that I am not alone in this body\"= The body feels pain- pain, because the two lovers cannot be together, for whatever worldly reasons. MJK is asking to be reminded that she love him, and that he is not alone in his feelings, both good and bad.\n\r\n\"Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion\"= Despite the world that fights to tear the two lovers apart, in their world (each other's arms) they are eternal. That would make anything else (the pain that the world inflicts) is merely an illusion.\n\r\n\"Swirling round with this familiar parable\"= I suspect this refers to a short story which expresses a moral display.\n\r\n\"Spinning, weaving round each new experience \"= Letting the world revolve around the love, and not the persecution. Use the joy as a center pint, a point of reference.\n\r\n\"Recognize this as a holy gift\" = Appreciate what they have when they are together, instead of dwelling on the sacrifice with which it is exchanged.\n\r\n\"Celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing\" = Basically just be happy to have those few and precious moments together.\n\r\n\"Remember, we are eternal, all this pain is an illusion\" = Do NOT let the worldly issues that threaten the love that the two share tear them apart, but instead, remain eternally strong, within each others arms.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_294": "\nAs many before me have stated, this song is about experiencing an enlightenment of consciousness. \n\r\n\"We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment\" = Our eternal spirits are not bound by memories.\n\r\n\"We are choosing to be here right now\" = Choose to not live in a state of conditioned reaction. Choosing to observe your ego from an external vantage point and not let it run your life for the real \"You\".\n\r\n\"Hold on, stay inside this holy reality\"= \"This Holy Reality\" refers to \"This Moment\". \"The Now\" or \"The Present\". Past and future are only pretend places in our mind. When we dwell on past or future we are literally  surrendering our lives to the sum of our conditioned responses.\n\r\n\"This body holding me\"= This body, this \"Ego\", This \"MJK\" that people think I am is not the real me. MJK is only form.\n\r\n\"Be my reminder here that I am not alone in this body\"= He knows (or wants to believe) that \"presence\" is in every body. He knows it, but it's hard to remember because so few people ever become free of ego.\n\r\n\"Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion\"= He feels one with consciousness. He has realized all pain is only form, and is neither good nor bad, only part of the experience. \n\r\n\"Swirling round with this familiar parable\"= Possibly the Bill Hicks quote. Possibly referring to an observed pattern. Not sure\n\r\n\"Spinning, weaving round each new experience \"= When you experience presence, you are literally in the zone. You are not being manipulated by conditioned ego reactions and life is simply beautiful. You are aligned with the universe and you are actually happening around the unconscious folks nearby. \n\n\r\n\"Recognize this as a holy gift\" = Now is the meaning of life. \n\r\n\"Celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing\" = We are hear to experience life. Love is the best way. \n\r\n\"Embrace this moment, remember: we are eternal, all this pain is an illusion\" = \n\r\nPast and future are traps for the mind. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build you very belief structure to state peace comes in the future. There is no future. There is only now. The future can never get here (we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never have peace because by its very definition it cannot. \n\r\nWikipedia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a linear conception of time, the future is the portion of the time line that has yet to occur, i.e. the place in space-time where lie all events that will occur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\r\nI have heard people ask \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with people today\u00e2\u0080\u009d when discussing violence, war, politics\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 everything. The true problem lies within our very belief structure. We believe that satisfaction is something you work towards and eventually acquire through suffering, sacrifice, war, diligence, wisdom, and countless other noble ideas. The problem here is that the belief IS the reality, not the means to it. Satisfaction or \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeace\u00e2\u0080\u009d IS NOT something you work towards. The future only exists in your head. \n\r\nAssuming you will have peace after some future event is simply a flawed thought. Shortly after the goal is reached, your engrained belief structure creates a new goal or longing for the ego to acquire. So in essence, the only way to be at peace is to never be at peace. That clever ego\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Shame on it.\n\r\nThe Ego may also dominate by using pain and lack to control a person. Pain lets the Ego know that \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u009d am NOT happy! This reinforces the belief that happiness can be found in the future, and thus the madness is incessant. \n\r\n  Have you ever met a person who always seems angry or is always involved in some sort of drama? Ever met someone very depressed for long periods of time? Ever been there? What is happening in those instances is the ego binging on pain. These people have developed conditioned responses that have trapped their mind in a world of make-believe.  They gain their sense of self using this belief pattern and it becomes very difficult to put it down because it works so well. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore pain please, it helps me feel peaceful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d some people seem to be asking. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure thing\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Universe responds. If they would only take a step back within themselves and observe their own minds reaction to the situation they might realize that they are more than the sum of their experiences. They might realize that there is something much more amazing going on here than \u00e2\u0080\u009cMe and My Story\u00e2\u0080\u009d and thus begin a new pattern of harmony with what is. \n\r\nBut I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably me that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crazy.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_295": "\npersonally i think its about change.

Parabol is about being concieved, so basically it's about sex.  It's soft and slow, basically like making love, so it's not about rough sex.  It's about  passion.  Once the last part comes in, it's about being a fetus.  Everything's so peaceful and soft.  Than suddenly birth starts and the baby starts to panic, but eventually calms down because the \"pain is an illusion.\"  The biggest hint I have to this meaning is the titles.. their ALMOST the same, except Parabol is incomplete.  It turns into parabola when life commences and thus is complete.\n\r\nNow onto Parabola.  So the song picks up and get intense... I mean to my meaning birthgiving is intense, so it makes sense.  The first verse is ALMOST the same as the last verse, which gives me the feeling the meaning is intertwined.  It represents infancy and how every thing is a blur.  You don't remember or think about anything but the present, which can see how the two verses come together.\n\r\nNow the middle, slower part is about maturity.  Everything slows down and you begin to think everything over, which can sometimes lead to suicidal thoughts.  Yet, in the end, you appreciate life and value every day you live.  The song picks up for a little bit to represent the last rush you have before a slow, calm death in the end.\n\r\nThe song(s) overall is the best ever.  It's my second favorite song by Tool and it's amazing to listen to.  It's the only song i can ever think deeply about.

The lyrics about himself which seem out of context for this interpretation are him opening his heart and soul to his son, praying the boy can overcome challenges that hold most people back, or maybe him experiencing the \"feelings of  eternal\" for the first time. Seeing your son being born is quite a profound experience, and makes most people get pretty philosophical about life. Maynard is brilliant at masking his meanings, and using double meanings.

Some believe the song is about Maynard's love for his son, some think it's about the human spirit and the evolution of our consciousness, some believe, for good reason, that it's about sex or drugs.\n\r\nWhat I love about Tool is that to every one of these thoughts there is a good degree of truth. I think that it's very possible that every one of these things were sources of inspiration for Maynard in this song; all were running through his head.\n\r\nIt is well known that Maynard is a big-time mushroom user, as it is that a good lot of their songs have deep sexual innuendos -- and, though sexual they may be, not one of them is conventionally perverted, as you will see in so much modern pop culture, but rather they convey a far deeper message derived from or using sex as a metaphor, we're seeing quite possibly the same thing here.\n\r\nThe beautiful, but progressing weave of poetry in this song was clearly a derivative of Maynard tripping, which, in every way, means it comes from that much deeper within him.\n\r\nI believe that Maynard's son Davo could also play a large part in this song, his feeling 'eternal', in that he may be living on through his son. This song could just as much be about his son as it could be a deep reflection on the night of his son's conception. The act, and the emotions therein.\n\r\nThe human consciousness was the constant theme throughout this album, and this song is clearly no exception in that regard. The lyrics \"This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality\" sound as though they were spoken from the perspective of a soul, about the body holding it. The lyrics \"Feeling eternal, all this pain is an illusion\" is where I draw validity for my previous statement. In a lot of religions and in most spiritual beliefs, no matter what pain may come, once you're dead your soul lives on forever, your soul can't feel pain, and in this regard pain is an illusion. It's a physical sensation, merely brainwaves.\n\r\nThere're a lot theories out there, and Tool has always encouraged people to use their brains, so try to derive a meaning for yourself.

This song (even according to Maynard himself) has to do with the fact that we, humans, are comprised of particles - same as everything else in the universe (being 'one' with the universe - eternal, since when we die, we are STILL particles within the same universe, just no longer in the same form) - and that we have come into being as an observer (in the form of a living, conscious, human body) and we are to appreciate this form to its utmost while we are in it. \n\r\nWithin this wave of particles (the universe), we take a bodily form (containing our consciousness) for a short period of time (remembering that we are still comprised as the same material as the universe itself, hence being 'one with the universe'), having the 'holy experience' and 'holy reality' of living as an observer (with a mind to perceive experiences, held together or contained by our bodies) within this universe. \n\r\nHaving said that, then, matter is essentially intangible, if you consider all matter is comprised of the same particles within the rest of the universe. As 'observers' of the universe, we should realize that what we experience is only our perception; Therefore, we are in control of our own experiences and must consciously realize that pain is simply a perception (as an observer to the universe) and, as such, it's just an illusion (that we've perceived in this body that contains this observer of the universe of which we are one in the same). \n\r\nWhew.

It is my personal belief that our soul is the same thing as our mind. Our body gives our soul a chance to experience life and what it means to be alive.\"\n\r\nI agree that the soul, the spirit (aka 'breath of life'), the mind, etc. are all names for the emergent phemomena of self-conscious cognition resulting from being embodied by our particular form. These capacities are specific to human physiology. All life is cognizant to a certain degree. We just happen to be aware of ourselves in relation to the external environment in a self-reflective sense, the highest known form of awareness. Our form is rare, complex, and robust and thus precious. We should not take our embodied form for granted. This 'body' that we have is it. It's all we have. It is everything to us. Our bodies coming into contact with the external environment beget and shape our unique minds; only then do our unique minds enable our bodies to fully experience life. Therefore, our bodies and minds/spirits/souls are actually one in the same (the phenomena of 'mind' emerges from the body's interactions with the world). The idea that they are separate, discrete, compartmental facets of existence is completely false. Being embodied as a human being is a rare, precious gift that should be treasured by anyone lucky enough to be born into this form. Experiencing life as a human being is being in heaven. It is the most holy reality and the most holy of experiences.

We choose to stay alive and go on this \"holy experience\" he speaks of because the energy (which is YOU) chooses to be in this body that's holding you (meaning the energy). We can easily disconnect from reality. Reality is a matrix, and matrix is an illusion. Energy never dies; it's always transferred on in some other form. Therefore, when you die, your physical body dies, not the soul or energy, it carries onto some other form. Therefore, pain is an illusion because everything you see, touch, smell, taste, or hear merely does not exist.\n\r\nWe go to bed every night accepting the fact that we will have a dream and wake up the next morning to carry on with our day.

But sometimes I think people over elevate the lyrics, to believe that they only focus on a magical realm of enlightenment.  That's too simplistic.  The beauty and truth in their writing is that they are us.  They are human, and in order to elevate yourself you must do it through dealing and mastering (as much as possible) the human world.  You are thinking that their every thought has to be above this world, and in reality they are telling you that the beauty and enlightenment you seek is not in a magical fairyland, it is right here, within you, within the world.  Just open your eyes and soul and see it. I think their lives, are not alien to ours.  They eat, sleep, get annoyed by others, have done drugs, have sex and feel love, and they write about these things as well as a place of enlightenment to be found on the other side of them.  In fact, every enlightened song they write that deals with enlightenment, deals first with working through the struggles of this world.\n\nTo me, Parabol and Parabola are love songs.  They are referring to the act of making love.  Sex can be a filthy thing, if you treat it like a physical release into the first thing you find, like driving a rusty nail down another needy hole, just satisfying our physical need.  But if you realize it can be something much more, you can feed not only your physical hunger, but your spiritual needs, it can be a holy experience.  There are no magical fairy tales, there is only the truth that is available to us.  Find your holiness inside of yourself.  Love is a beautiful holiness that you must first find inside of yourself.  If you find someone who can find that same beautiful holiness inside of their self, and they share it with you, together you make more holiness in your union, than is possible by just yourselves individually.  That spiritual union of two becoming more than their separate selves, unlocking the soul from the body somehow, is a holy gift.  \n\nIf you are truly making love, you can lose yourself in it.  You would not be concerned about who or what came before that precious moment or anything else.  All of that would be the furthest thing from your mind.  The current experience is so great, you are totally enveloped by it.  How many other things can you say that about.  \n\n\"This holy REALITY.  This holy experience.\"  Again, the enlightenment you seek is within you. -  This is not a reference to some out of this world magical place.  It is real.  It is here and now, but it is holy.  They are always trying to tell you that.  They are trying to be your tool to help guide you to find your own way through this world.  The anger felt in so many of their songs is the fact that we often don't seek the holiness, we usually shit on it.  This place, earth, this existence could be so much more, but we give into being shitheads and make it a hell on earth instead.    \n\n\"Choosing to be here in this body.  This body holding me.\"  (He is speaking of his lover who is in her (or maybe his) body (not his own), that is holding (in a loving embrace) \"me\" (his own).  And she is choosing to be there (in body and spirit, to give love).  Obviously her body is there, but why he says she's choosing to be there is because she's choosing to be there totally, on a higher spiritually loving level, prepared to pull her soul out of her body to entwine with his soul.  It's amazing that in this world filled with evil you can find that.  And that's why he says a line like, \"choosing to be here\", which otherwise would be a mundane indicator of location.  But he means so much more by it.  You can see how this line relates to the other about not being aware of anything else.  You wouldn't be if you were truly \"choosing to be here\". \n\nThere's a bit of a clever play on words....like they do all the time.  This body, sometimes is referring to him and sometimes is referring to the other person's body.  That's why it repeats.  He introduces her body holding him, inside of his body holding him. \n\n\"Be my reminder that I am not alone\" Pretty self explanatory don't you think.  It goes to my point that this is something shared with somebody else, not a song of just SELF enlightenment, but finding it WITH somebody else, which is even more \"magical\" if you will.  His real self, his spiritual self, is not unreachable or untouchable locked inside of his own body.  For this holy experience somebody is truly able to touch his soul inside of his body.  He has been reached there and now realizes he is not isolated alone in there.    \n\n\"in this body.  This body holding me\" He is speaking of his own body now.  The physical vessel that is holding his real self, his spiritual self.  He speaks of it objectively because he knows he is much more than that physical shell that just holds the real him.    \n\n\"feeling eternal. All this pain is an illusion\".   While there is no magical fairyland that is going to dump magical holiness upon you, there is a holiness to be found and felt.  It is within yourself.  And somehow, for some reason, there is something holy about making love that bares your soul like nothing else does, to someone else's, and them to you.  And when you are touching souls like that, intertwining souls, it lets you know, that you can come out of that physical shell of yours, that you can be touched inside of it.  That you are not locked in there alone.  That it is possible to not just hold hands, but hold another's soul.  And when you realize that, you realize that you are not locked in your body, you are able to be reached, then you realize that you are not alone.  It is possible to escape all of this pain in the world, at least during that holy experience.  To be able to experience that is \"a holy gift\".  \n\nAnd when you experience this out of body experience, if you hadn't already known, then at that point you realize that we are more than the body, that \"we are eternal\" and once you realize that, then you realize \"all this pain is an illusion\".\n\nIt's amazing that when I refer to this as a love song, people think I'm crazy.  Then I get sad for them, because if they can't understand it, maybe they've never felt it.  \n\nI must admit that I'm in my 40s and some of what TOOL writes, must be lived to be fully felt or understood.  I don't mean to downplay a younger person's existence.  It's like they say with blues.  You have to have felt them to play them well.  Someone who's been lucky enough to never really live a hard life, truly wouldn't understand or feel the depth of the blues.  The anger they express from the frustration that others bring to their lives, must be experienced to understand.  The damage it does to you and the low places it takes to you must be felt to understand.  The realization that they have taken control of your life and made you an angry, unhappy person and the weak desperation of that, is something you must go through to feel.  Finding a path out of that, finding your own peace, growth and higher level is also something that must be experienced to understand.  It's not a moment of enlightenment and I'm there instantly \"Praise Jesus\" - LOL.  Instead, it's a tough journey of learning.  They take on the endeavor of trying to be your tool to help you get there.  I mentioned my age, because I don't think it's possible to get to the end without having gone through all of the rest of it.  So perhaps it helps to be a little more experienced to fully understand them.  It's not about age, it's about the journey. Forgive me because I know I've stepped out of and beyond just this song this comment is attached to.\n\nAs clear as this seems to be a love song to me, I realize, that's just me.  Maybe it's also Maynard, maybe not.  Maybe it's just me finding that in his words.  Maybe the truth of this song is something different to someone else, but no less of a truth.  Just thought I'd share my truth I found in these words and music.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_373": "\nthe song that lets the cat out of the bag. everything that has followed is re-mystification of sorts. but this song requires no interpretation. we are eternal\u00e2\u0080\u0094what more is there to know, really. ;)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_374": "\nInspired by Tool, if life is like y=x^2, where x is you in a specific moment of Planck time and y is your reality in that moment, the graph of the parabola exists at all times.

Ron Hubbard and fuck all his clones\" (L. Ron Hubbard being the founder of said religion). The main belief is that there are these immortal things called \"Thetans\", which are ultimately souls, that are trapped on this planet. They enter the bodies of humans, hence the lyric \"this body holding me, feeling eternal\". Another belief is that pain does not exist, only the negative thoughts towards pain, and with enough prayer, all illnesses and ailments can be made to disappear, which explains the lyric \"All this pain is an illusion\" rather well. One other small thing, that isn't concrete evidence, but supports my theory is the frequent use of the word \"holy\" throughout the song, which suggests a religious theme to the song. Hope this helps clear the air somewhat.\n-Reggie\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_379": "\nI think it's about sex. Not raunchy sex but actual lovemaking. They are so in the moment that they remember nothing that happened before. It's obviously a \"precious moment.\" \n\n\"Stay inside\" is pretty literal haha. It's spiritual lovemaking (Holy experience). They are literally holding each other's bodies. \n\nJust my two cents.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_380": "\nI think it's about Scientology - \"We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment\" Pretty much forgot about the whole Xenu thing, \"I am not alone in This body\" The 'Thetans' clinging to people, \"Recognize this as a holy gift and Celebrate this chance to be Alive and breathing\" That thing you buy to get the 'Thetans' out of you(I forget what it's called), \"This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality Embrace this moment, remember: we are eternal, all this pain is an illusion\" They think your souls are immortal and are reincarnated and have been reincarnated. (I'm not a believer of this religion, I'm Atheist, it just really makes sense to me that it's talking about Scientology and didn't they play for that L. Ron Hubbard guy when they were starting out?) \n\n\n"}
