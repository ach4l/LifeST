Let me break it down for you:\n\r\n\"In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs\r\nOf ev\u00e2\u0080\u0099ry head he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had the pleasure to know.\"\n\r\nHe keeps a set of photos of everyone famous he's met, like an autograph book.  Not too out there, but still strange behavior.\n\r\n\"And all the people that come and go\r\nStop and say \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hello\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\"\n\r\nThe ordinary people of Penny Lane/Liverpool want to be near greatness, so they participate in the oddity, and stop in to look at the photos of people they'll never be.\n\r\nOn the corner is a banker with a motorcar,\r\nThe little children laugh at him behind his back.\"\n\r\nA rich banker (the motorcar shows he's rich) has lots of illegitimate children, their presence is mocking him (probably because he has to pay off their mothers)\n\r\n\"And the banker never wears a mac\r\nIn the pouring rain - very strange.\"\n\r\nMack = raincoat = rubber = condom.  Even though it's likely to get him ANOTHER illegitimate child (bastard), he continues to have sex without rubbers (because he's arrogant or likes the feeling better, whichever)\n\r\n\"Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes,\r\nThere beneath the blue suburban skies\r\nI sitt, and meanwhile back\"\n\r\nHe's (Paul) sitting observing and listening and ferreting out what is driving the people he sees - what's beneath the surface of their daily lives\n\r\n\"In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass\r\nAnd in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.\r\nHe likes to keep his fire engine clean,\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a clean machine.\"\n\r\nA man who keeps punctuality as a goal.  Very indicative of the British Condition, subverting all of one's desires to an admiration and striving for a goal that one can keep, instead.  He keeps a portrait of the Queen, another person he'll never reach or touch, but his perversion is that the Queen - a 'handsome' woman - is his masturbatory fantasy, and, like clockwork - punctually - he masturbates (keeps the fire engine clean) often - it is, after all, a clean machine, worthy of the Queen.\n\r\n\"Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes,\r\nA four of fish and finger pies\r\nIn summer meanwhile back\"\n\r\nIn the summer, when things are warm and free-er, boys finger women in the streets after dark...\n\r\n\"Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout\r\nThe pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.\"\n\r\nShe's selling medical morphine and other narcotics to supplement her income.  Nothing to do with war remembrance; it's a juxtaposition of the pretty nurse trafficking in stolen narcotics.\n\r\n\"And though she feels as if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a play\r\nShe is anyway.\"\n\r\nHer actions are surreal to her, feeling justified because it's all unreal; but all the world's a stage, and she's a player doing it for Paul's benefit (his observation).\n\r\n\"In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer,\r\nWe see the banker sitting waiting for a trim\"\n\r\nThe Banker is waiting to see a mistress, and using the barber as a reason for being out of the office.\n\r\n\"And then the fireman rushes in\r\nFrom the pouring rain - very strange.\"\n\r\nThe fireman is afraid of women - the pouring rain symbolizes (as above) the potential for fathering children - and he rushes indoors (would rather masturbate because women terrify him).\n\r\nNow, children, THAT's what the song is about.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nisnt it supposed to be \"back\"... cause i think the persona is in the suburbs while penny lane is in the city but i def could be wrong.

She was 13 when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan show. I'm Canadian, but my wife is from Liverpool and grew up just a few blocks away from Penny Lane. We went back to England on our honeymoon (20 years ago) and her grandmother walked us both down to Penny Lane. Road signs in England are usually tacked onto a corner wall at the intersections (a opposed to using a pole). The Penny Lane sign had been stolen so many times the city council finally decided to paint the name \"Penny Lane\" right on the brickwork! Yes, the street was in very nice, and yes there is in fact a roundabout! Rows of shops on both sides of the street, and many flower beds here and there. Penny Lane is a LOVELY song about truly nice place with warm, friendly people!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI live in Smithdown Road.

I'm over-annalysing, i know...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nJust like it's companion piece \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"Penny Lane\" is a song dealing with childhood nostalgia. Or to be more precise, a now grown up man achingly trying to reach for that youthful perspective of the world, which obviously makes him happy, since he is nowadays probably stuck in a more troubled life.\n\nBecause the storyteller is not really there, you see. His \"observations\" are rather a kaleidoscopic collage of images and impressions, assembled during his childhood days (and adolescence as well, judging from the veiled sexual allegorys - the \"clean machine\" part could be a reference, the \"finger pie\" one certainly is). Instead he quite literarily sits \"behind the blue suburban skies\", not so much imaging the place as reminiscing it.\n\nWhile both \"Penny Lane\" and \"Strawberry Fields\" are essentially happy nostalgic song, there are disturbing things lurking just beneath the surface. While the latter has a slightly frightening theme underlying it, the nature of \"Penny Lane\" is more of a sad one (would Macca ever write a truly frightening song? - never mind \"Helter Skelter\"). While the refrain should count as one of the peppiest pieces of pop music ever written (exactly evocative of the feeling the storyteller is trying to get across), there are certain moments in the song where the melody, if only for a few seconds, turns moodier. The point where the mood gets most anxious coincides with the line \"she feels as if she's in a play - she is anyway\". This must be interpreted as the cynical grown up's rationalizing of the the Childhood Dreamer, even though they are the same person (or maybe the sober Paul reaching through to the high Paul - I'll leave the drug talk to others). And this is where the tragic aspects of the song (and the whole concept of nostalgia) becomes evident; the dream can never really be realized.\n\nBut we always find ourself returning to the bittersweet nursings of nostalgia, don't we? Just as we keep returning to \"Penny Lane\". This is truly one of the Beatles' very best songs.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nPenny Lane is now the most recognizable road (by name)in England.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nI wonder..... what exactly, does nack mean?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nit was an honest mistake.  no need to be rude.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nI think anna118k was being sarcastic...strwberry was just clarifying it, and then rainbow came and bitched everyone out...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\ni think you're probably right.  bitched being the operative word.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\na \"fish-and-finger pie\" is a clever Liverpudlian reference to a sex act involving hands and female genitalia.\n\r\nmuch like Shakespeare and Prince, the Beatles were adept at throwing in vague sexual references and cryptic childhood inside jokes into their lyrics.\n\r\nlike in \"Daytripper\"...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nhell yea! i live on penny lane :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nI live in Liverpool now, and I have to drive by Penny Lane every day.
