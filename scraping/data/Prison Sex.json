{"comment_0": "\nPrison Sex is about child molestation and cycles of abuse. \n\nThe creaking at the beginning of the song is meant to emulate a door being gently pushed open, creaking loud among the silence.\n\nHe hadn't picked up the name Maynard yet, that came later. He was James now. Probably was referred to as 'Jimmy' around this time. He was 11. His mom had her fateful aneurysm that left her broken down and paralyzed, forever changed, her faithful devotion intensified and led her to become more and more delusional and willfully ignorant. \n\nJimmy's stepfather was caring for him at this time, he inspires the content for this song for about two years until Judith finally sends him to his fathers in Michigan.\n\nThe part that gets me is that the child molestation is only the first verse, the rest of the song is about him, the victim, becoming the perpetrator. What fucks my mind is that i cant decide whether of not this is a metaphor for him getting into sodomy as a result (4 degrees, stinkfist) or if he for real raped a dude. Or both.\n\nIn the live sessions of Prison Sex they add a set of lyrics right before the 'i have found some kind of temporary sanity..' climax, Here they are:\n\n\"Show me something (4x)\nThought I could make it end\nThought I could wash the stains away\nThought I could break the circle if I\nSlipped right into your skin\nSo sweet was your surrender\nWe have become one\nI have become my terror\nAnd you my precious lamb and martyr\"\n\nI never quite understood the 'Lamb and Martyr' part until i heard/read this, and even so i hope its only just my interpretation. he's referring to a single person. If you can't see what im getting at maybe its best i don't spell it out..\n\nBefore playing 'Jimmy' live once, Maynard addressed the crowd, announcing it as the sequel to Prison sex. Jimmy being a very personal story, the announcement of it as a 'Sequel\" to Prison Sex is kind of shocking. That gives it a light of being a personal story, just by that strong association. H is a sister piece to Prison sex, its about him struggling with the abuse he grew up with, in the face of having a child of his own. The snake hissing was his lamb and martyr. That's a beautiful song about him realizing he doesnt have to perpetuate.\n\nI have a deeper respect for Maynard than i ever have ever had for a singular artist, and the reason for that is songs like Prison sex, Jimmy, H, Judith, Passive, Orestes... he just completely opens himself up and turns his personal pain and sorrow into beautiful art as a means to move forward himself and as a tool for others to do so as well. \"Turn these leaden grudges into gold\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nok this song is for one about exactly what it sounds like - rape - but more importantly the psychology of a rapist.  now take it a step further i beleive he uses this example to get accross a broader point.  that point is that when horrible or traumatizing  things happen in our past especially childhood it has a certain affect on people.  one way some people deal with it is by inflicting pain on others  as an outlet.  \"you are my martyr my lamb\" means that you must suufer / be sacrificed for me to feel better or maybe to feel anything at all.  hands bound and head down obviously works as a rape visual but also as a symbol that he is a slave bound to repeat these horrors without controlle or so it seems.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nFrom the most superficial standpoint, this is a gross song about being butt-raped in prison...not very appealing, so looking deeper's necessary. The following lines are the most important, I would say:\n\r\nDo unto others what has been done to you \n\r\nDo unto you now what has been done to me \n\r\nI've come round full circle. \r\n(quoted from tool's official site's lyrics)\n\r\nI think it's more about victims turning around and victimizing others.  At first they are violated, but with time they \"come around\" to their predator's ways, and violate others themselves.\n\r\nThis is not confined to sexual predation or just to prison.  In fact, it seems more like Maynard means to draw a parallel to other froms...religious \"recruiters\" seem a good example. \r\npreying on the weak and feeble-minded, they convert somebody to their faith, and they cannot defend against these people so because of weak-mindedness they go along, and ignorantly believe what they're told.\r\nNow, they become the missionaries, and ignorantly follow orders to find \"recruits.\"  They victimize other people based on how they were originally victimized.\r\n(I'm not dogging all religious types now, just those who fit this example)\n\r\nEven a child playing an online computer game can fit it.  Someone cheats , and he loses out, so he gets angry and starts cheating, ripping off other people.\n\r\nThe concept of this song relates to many many things, we \"come around full circle\" a lot, and adopt what is handed to us, whether by a malicious enemy, or by inadvertent ignorance.  So keep your third eye open and think about this one...\n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThe meaning of the song is pretty simple, which makes it all the more horrify. Someone has been raped, and the only way they can find catharsis, the only way they can cope with the trauma, is by raping themselves.

To me it seems like Maynard is talking about a child who was sexually abused and then growing up and abusing their child in the same way because its all that they really knew of childhood and growing up.  \r\n      \"Do unto you now what has been done to me\"\r\nIn relation to the title of the song, the child's home became a prison because their abuser kept the child there, or if not that it could be seen as emotional imprisonment.\r\nFor me, seeing the video really made all of this come together, but that's just my interpretation, so who knows what Maynard was really thinking about this song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nMaynard said in one of the rare interviews he did that it's about how he was raped as a child.

In another interview, he states how all you people who feel the need to post your own meanings and ideas are bullshit people. The band makes music so you can think about it and analyze it by yourself. They dont even put the lyrics on the album because they aim for you to listen to the music with the creative side of your brain, to express yourself, to build upon yourself. When simply reading his message instead of individually gaining your own understanduing, you do not gain the ability to expand for yourself. Their goal is to create spiritual music that helps people, not bullshit rumors and illogical ideas to misconstrew other people's individual beliefs of the messages directed towards them and only them which they discover in the music. Fuck people. Think for yourselves.\n\r\nLastly, this is just a personal note that i believe in. People keep asking bands if they are making new albums, yet they dont give them money, they steal their albums online. Fuck those people.

Taking what we know about TOOL and Maynard's expressive views on organized religion(based on other TOOL/perfect circle songs) we can look at this song in a similar light and find a meaning that has little to do with molestation and rape and much more to do with forced indoctrination especially by Christianity. \n\nTaking the first few lines of this song: \n\"It took so long to remember just what happened\nI was so young and vestal then\nYou know it hurt me\nBut I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive\"\nThis opening could draw parallels to the popular Christian practice of Baptism where an infant in bathed with \"holy water\" to symbolize purification and admission to the Christian Church when they have no say in the matter.\n\nThe lyrics: \n\"I've got my hands bound\nMy head down, my eyes closed\nAnd my throat wide open\"\nThis is a prime example of parallelism between the church and the message trying to be portrayed here. The imagery of these few lines is a perfect picture of someone praying. \"hands bound\" being a persons hands and fingers laced together. \"head down\" and \"eyes closed\" are that of a person in a typical position of one praying with \"my throat wide open\" being the actual vocalization of praising god.  \n\nLook at all the lyrics of this incredible song and find the religious meaning yourself, it doesn't take much of a stretch of the imagination to do so. Once these parallels are made the entire meaning of the song changes from a child that is forced into performing sexual acts to a child that is forced into a life of religious servitude that has been passed down from generations before. \n\nThe song starts in the point of view of the newly indoctrinated child to the point of view of presumably that same child, grown and passing their values onto the next generation with this vicious cycle repeating over and over again. This is seen in the lyrics \"my hands bound....your hands bound\"\n\"I've become my terror\" states the point that this indoctrinated being has become that in which harmed it in the beginning, that in which imbued the cycle from the start, that in which they tried so desperately to avoid becoming.\n\nJust my interpretation of this tune. Its one of my favorites and would love to know what people think!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nThe \"one holy medium\" is probably the Bible's phrase \"Do unto others what has been done to you\".

Prison sex ends with all of us understanding it to be that the man (in a somewhat vengeful way) seeks to take his losses of dignity back from someone who didn't take them away to begin with and he leaves it open without any mention and possibly no intention of correcting this circle of pain. But here he shows that he is questioning what he did. the words \"I thought...\" and \"Temporary\" add a real intention to break the cycle, even though he couldn't bring himself to do it. This may have been a sort of sell out change for him. He may have done it so as to keep the fans who would have trouble understanding this.

It is so intense.  It is too easy to get inside this song...and it truly hurts--really hurts.  Funny that I should love it then.\n\r\nThe irony I find in this song (if I am using the term correctly) is in the fact that when I hear it, I understand the \"do unto others what has been done to you\" part, and I know that the once victim is now the villain, but if I try to put myself in the lyrics, I still feel victimized from both viewpoints.  Just something to think about.  Psychologically, I think that any serial killer or serial rapist will probably still feel like the victim.  Anyone who is hurting feels victimized in some way, I think.  And those who hurt others do so because just maybe it's the only way they can imagine not being the victim--they can become the opposite, shouldn't this feel better?  Shouldn't this bring peace?  \n\r\nTwo wrongs don't make a right though....

What if, instead, the song is about being trapped in the wrong gender? The \"rape\" or forced item would then instead be the pressures of society to fall within the two gendered line.\n\r\n\"I have found some kind of temporary sanity in this \r\nshit blood and cum on my hands.\" \r\nIn this line, we see three products of the huamn genitals; \"cum\" (whose origin I'm sure we're all familiar with), blood (which may infact be menstrual blood, indicating femininity) and \"shit\" (the unifying \"product\" so to speak between the genders, we both shit the same way). In a way, these three elements allow the owner of the hand to assume both genders, even if only for a moment. To find some sanity, some comfort in pretending he is his chosen gender.\n\r\n\"I've got my hands bound, \r\nmy head down, my eyes closed, \r\nand my throat wide open. \"\r\nThis line, as many have previously pointed out, quite clearly illustrates repression or confinement of some kind. Hands are bound by gender stereotypes, head forced down by pressure from family and peers, eyes closed to prevent the \"prisoner\" from seeing the facade reality going up around him, and throat wide open. One's throat is wide open in basically two directions; accepting and removing. The open throat can accept the pressure of society, swallowing them down in the prostrate position you are bound in. The throat is also open when speaking. A common defence mechanism, reaction formation, could be said to be in place here. The \"prisoner\" feels all this pressure, feels the confines of his bindings, but still spouts the propoganda he's been fed for years, swearing the gender he was born with is, in fact, the one he would choose. \n\r\nI could go on, and try to analyze the entire song, but I won't. Just remember, the common usages of words aren't always the ones the artist intended.

I figure this song is also about some sorta abuse. But I don't think its the abuse that a rape-ee is getting. Its the abuse that a raper (sp?) is going through. \"Do unto others what has been done to you\" is the rapist talking to him/herself. Its their way of putting logic to their crime, like all major criminals have done.\n\r\n It seems like the rapist seems superior to his/her victim. The video brought that out to me. The legless doll was the victim to the skinny black one. The skinny black one wanted to befriend the other, so it made sure he couldn't leave, by taking off its legs. It took something away (parallels with virginity). The black doll wouldn't let the other one leave at all costs. The little doll was basically bound (parallels with rapists' actions to prey). Then while the little doll was crawling around, it saw other dolls, that look similar to it (parallels to rapists capturing people in a certain mannor). \n\r\nIt also seems to be that a lot of this is driected to the church, who may be \"raping our minds\" or what-have-you.

The \"child\" could be a caricature of a victim, but then the lines \r\n\"It took so long to remember just what happened/I was so young and vestal then\" come in to play.\r\nWhen the word \"Young\" is said, the first thing that comes to mind is children, and with the video combined with the lyrics the first impression is Child abuse. \r\nAll of these stories about Maynard being raped behind the tool shed by his step father... Well, I wouldn't be jumping to conclusions as this song could be conceptual and Maynard has never admitted to being abused by his Step father.\r\nAt the same time, we must take in to account that being raped by your step father isn't something anyone would brag about, and in the song Aenema where he says \r\n\"Fuck these dysfunctional Insecure actresses\"\r\nWhich may express the anger he has towards these celebrities that never stop talking about how hard their lives are/were, this could explain his silence (assuming that the rape theory is true).\n\r\nVery few people seemed to touch upon the other little creatures inside the room with the drawers. I allways felt that when the Victimiser killed the clay man, it represented the part of the victim that is \"killed\" during the abuse (possibly the other creatures could represent diffrent aspects of the childs mind). \r\nThat's all I have to say really, most other things seem to have been allready covered.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_107": "\nI think that many people are taking this song waaay to superficially, c'mon this is tool, it is deep music. the lines \"Won't you come a bit closer,\r\nclose enough so I can smell you.\r\nI need you to feel this,\r\nI can't stand to burn too long.\r\nReleased in this sodomy.\r\nFor one sweet moment I am whole. \"\r\nsuggest that the narrator is in some sort of pain and wants his victimizer to feel his own pain, instead of becoming a victimizer to a new victim I think the narrator has made it so that both him and his previous victimizer are feeling pain, as if the other came cloe enough to feel the same burn\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_108": "\nHonestly I think ALL tool songs have a broad spectrum of meanings.

This song is aimed at abuse people recieve and turn it in within themselves or as a result lash out on an external source. Once you let the abuse you have recieved whether it be sexual, verbal, religious or whatever govern your actions or your outlook on the world you have become the victumizer. The cycle has completed itself. Instead of confronting your demons, they poccess you and you become the abuser of yourself or others. \"do unto others what has been done to you\" But you also need to understand your victumizer to overcome this. In many cases the victumizers don't realize the harm they are doing to someone. Many child molesters for instance don't believe they are hurting the child but showing them love. To inflict the abuse you have recieved can bring a \"tempoary sanity\" By completing the circle of abuse and you become the abuser you feel as if you have destroyed the fear and violation you felt when you where abused. The power you feel when the circle is completed brings an overwhelming sense of completion. When you are abused the need to feel the opposite of the hurt you feel controls you. An act of abuse is more directed to free oneself rather than hurt the victum. People who are products of abuse need to recongnize this circle forming before it is to late and you are consumed by the power of completing the cycle of abuse. They must confront this tendency of abuse that will not be cured by denial or further abuse. By turning your abuse outwards you become what you hate and fear. You have to search within yourself and confront this festering pain that is resulting in further abuse.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_122": "\nWATCH THE VIDEO, SEE THE \"ABUSER\" BLACK TALL GUY, HE IS SKINNY AND BLACK, THEN AT THE END OF THE VIDEO  THE LITTLE GUY BECOMES SKINNY FOR A SECOND, AND LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE OTHER, THEN HE PAINTS HIMSELF BLACK WITH THE BRUSH THE OTHER GUY USED ON HIM, HE IS SOMEHOW BECOMING LIKE THE ABUSER, THERE IS ANOTHER PART, WHERE THE BLACK'S GUYS HEAD OPENS, AND INSIDE HIS HEAD, THE SMALL GUY IS SPINNING, LIKE TRYING TO GET OUT, HES REMEMBERING WHEN HE WAS THE ABUSED ONE, AND HE WAS JUST LIKE HIS VICTIM IS NOW, AND HE IS LIKE HIS VICTIM WILL BE\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_123": "\nI saw this at the songfacts.com profile of Prison Sex, and I was curious as to what this guy is talking about.

Here is my best understanding of the symbolism involved in the song and video.\n\r\nFirst of all, this is a song about a person caught in a cycle of psychological abuse.  They are trying to understand what happened to them, and how they came to be an abuser themselves.  Rape (or prison sex) is a metaphor here.  The video provides more insight into the meaning of the song.\n\r\nUnderstand that everything that happens in the video is inside the mind of this abuser (the black figure) who is trying to make sense of the cycle he is caught in.  The black figure is not only the main character but also a symbol for the original abuser and a symbol for the pain and damage that lives on in the abused.\n\r\nThe childlike figure (the little broken guy) is the black figure\u00e2\u0080\u0099s victim.  However, the little guy is perhaps also represetative of the black figure when he was younger, more innocent and was victimized by a similar (or identical) black figure.\n\r\nThe video (and the abuse) begins with the black figure cutting off the legs of the little guy and throwing him in a drawer.  The best way to hold someone in your grip is to immobilize them.  People who are abused are vulnerable in some way, feel that they cannot leave. They are trapped and they must take the abuse.  The childlike figure looks up at his legs and wonders how he got to this fucked up place.\n\r\nWhen the black figure shows up, the little guy collapses\u00e2\u0080\u0094playing dead to survive.  The black figure is going to fuck with him no matter what, but by being submissive, he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t evoke the most violent abuse because the black figure feels a little sorry for the little guy.\n\r\nNext we see the little guy searching around in a drawer.  He pulls out a jar with a bee in it.  This is his victim that he abuses and holds captive\u00e2\u0080\u0094the cycle of abuse continues.\n\r\nWhen the black figure returns, the little guy collapses again.  The black figure then uses a paintbrush on him.  Here the black figure is \u00e2\u0080\u009ccaring for\u00e2\u0080\u009d the little guy, superficially fixing him up, making himself feel better.  Later the little guy will mark himself with black paint\u00e2\u0080\u0094expressing that he is hurt, scarred.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly this one holy medium brings me piece of mind\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094 the one holy medium refers to the act of abuse and control.  The reason that the little guy is a doll (with no humanity), is because this is how the black figure views his victim.  He is there to be manipulated, toyed with.  He can remove a piece or add one as he wishes.  The black figure stomps on the fleshy human figure when it emerges from a drawer.  \n\r\nWe see the black figure remove the eyeplate from little guy and look through his eyes.  Its obvious that the black figure understands the little guys plight.  He feels bad, he knows what a monster he has become, but continuing the abuse is how he escapes feeling like the victim himself.\n\r\nWhen the centipede with little guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head comes and stares at little guy, I think this is little guy realizing he is becoming more alien, more like his abuser.  Eventually he will be the black figure himself.  The black figure watches on from the shadows.  The cycle continues.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_136": "\nyep this song means prison sex (being the bitch anyways) is not in anyway fun at all....\n\r\nand its kinda cool i think that in a way he goes from both point of view, the bitch, and the butch\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_137": "\nlet me just say this. this song is not about prison sex at all.

Prison sex is merely a funny but relevant metaphor for tricking the public, like Tool likes to do (see Die Eier Von Satan).\n\r\nI definitely see the child abuse interpretations, but a lot of lines jump out at me that seem pretty religious. The first verse seems to me like baptism. The second verse however, reminds me of trials by drowning. In the middle ages, people, mostly women, accused of being witches (which was a Christian accusation and crime) were thrown into lakes. If they drowned, they were human and innocent (and dead); if they floated, they were guilty of being a witch..so they were taken from the lake and burned at the stake. \"I'm treading on water, i need sleep....i can't stand to burn too long\" vaguely remind me of this. \n\r\nBut back to my original interpretation of religion raping you..\r\nFirst verse is baptism. Second verse is some kind of test or trial. Third verse is being indoctrinated or accepting what's being forced on you, in this case, religion. \n\r\n\"For I am your witness that\r\nblood and flesh can be trusted.\r\nAnd only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind. \n\r\nGot your hands bound, your head down,\r\nyour eyes closed.\r\nYou look so precious now.\"....this latter part really seems to me to be describing someone in the praying position, speaking the former part to their rapist (aka whoever is forcing their views on them).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_150": "\nJust my thoughts...\n\r\nI am of the child abuse vein of interpretation, in spite of its religious overtones.\n\r\nI read all 6 pages and i don't think anyone touched on this. The line \"my lamb and martyr\"... Lamb is in a sense a word for child, as in Jesus is the lamb (child)of god, as well as a martyr. In the song, the adult is talking to his child and knowing that the child will die (in a sense) because of the sins the adult is commiting. When he says that line coupled with, \"you look so precious\" it shows the tenderness that the abuser normally has for his child, as well as the sick twistedness of the situation, feeling the tender feelings while commiting a reprehensible act.\n\n\r\n\"only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind\" When children/people are abused, in order to deal with the trauma and the pain later in life, they a lot of times behave in ways of repeating the abuse on someone else, or seeking out similar situations that would allow for the same type of abuse to occur to them again as a way of 'owning' the act and the pain. Victims of abuse often feel helpless and out of control. If they own it, they now control it. they are taking the power back into their own hands and it has a therapeutic effect.\n\r\nThe verse changes have a clear evolution of the abused turning into the abuser. The beginning  talks of what he endured and remembered when his innocence was lost, and the later, when he is taking on the abuser role.\n\r\n\"Won't you come on a bit closer,\r\nclose enough so I can smell you.\r\nI need you to feel this.\r\nI need this to make me whole.\"\n\r\nThis part says to me his struggle with perverse want for gratification,  and desperation. He needs to inflict the same pain on someone else for him to feel healed.\n\r\n\"I am your witness that\r\nblood and flesh can be trusted\"\n\r\nHe is telling the child what he learned as a child.

Such as sniffing gas etc. But being practically locked in the reservations there is (seemingly to them) no way out of the circle. \"It is just how family is.\"\n\r\nBecause of legislation, Aboriginal People were not allowed to own their own land and use it as equity in banks, without equity, there were no business', and with no businesses there was no income. If a native person left the reservation they would lose any rights an \"Indian\" had in law. Those who did leave (usually Single mothers), were usually hit hard with racism and joblessness which led to prostitution and stuff like that. There is definitely more to say on the matter, but it is like 2am here. haha... \n\r\nFrom courses I've taken in Aboriginal Studies, they said that an abusive family usually doesnt report abuse because within the family there is still love. There is an odd dichotomy of love and hate and an abuser doesnt want to see that person they care for hurt, even though they've been hurt by them.\n\r\nSo, this song could hit pretty hard to a Native person who has lived this life. It is sad... \r\nThere is a novel called, Porcupines and China Dolls that really hits this subject hard.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_157": "\ni read tools biography and it said it was about molestation in a family\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_158": "\nMaynard stated in a Revolver Magazine interview that the song was about child molestation by a preacher/priest/reverend.\r\n---\"And only this one holy medium brings me piece of mind.\"--- \n\n\n\n", "comment_159": "\npeople have a tendency of treating others as they've been treated. when you treat someone nicely their behavior will most likely reflect that with other people. when people are seriously wronged they have a way of getting even, maybe even taking it out years later on a completely different person who has done them no wrong. this only leads to vicious cycles of hate and pain.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_160": "\nWe are trapped in a neuronal prison - the easiest method of relief is transferring the pain we have felt into other people.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_161": "\nma hombeboy who is like real good wit musik told me its bout his stepfather rapin him when he was young cause when he got out of prison he was all screwed up and shit...umm who knos though wel maybe yall but not me\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_162": "\nIt is totally about sexual child abuse I mean \"My lamb and martyr...\" a lamb being a baby while using that child's trust of the parent to come closer to them and eventually it happens.

Here's my breakdown:\n\n\r\nIt took so long to remember just what happened.\r\nI was so young and vestal then,\r\nyou know it hurt me,\n\r\n- I think this part basically introduces the idea that humanity used to be so innocent and ignorant of materialism, ideologies, or economics, and were more concerned with more holistic matters of meaning.\n\r\nbut I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive\r\neven if signs seem to tell me otherwise.\n\r\n - and so now we perceive living as simply getting through the years, ignoring the \"signs\" that there is something much greater out there we are missing in our big picture.\n\r\nI've got my hands bound,\r\nmy head down, my eyes closed,\r\nand my throat wide open. \n\r\n- I think this is just a great way of saying we aren't even looking around us to see what's going on, swallowing anything that's given to us.\n\r\nDo unto others what has been done to you x2\n\r\n- This is the common ideology of western man, we justify our actions based on the actions of others. Quite contrary to the ideal of \"Do unto others as you would have done unto you.\"\n\r\nI'm treading water,\r\nI need to sleep a while.\n\r\n - We are simply passing the time.\n\r\nMy lamb and martyr, you look so precious.\n\r\n- I think the lamb and martyr is any person who we take advantage of in one way or another in our every day lives. This is how our society works, we wait for an opportunity to get ahead of others. Or it might just be the innocence that still exists in us?\n\r\nWon't you come a bit closer,\r\nclose enough so I can smell you.\n\r\n- Smell is one of the most profound senses, humanity has long forgotten its importance but most animals rely on it for their entire world view... you only really identify smell with the people who mean the most to you.\n\r\nI need you to feel this,\r\nI can't stand to burn too long.\r\nReleased in this sodomy.\r\nFor one sweet moment I am whole. \n\r\n- I think this is basically talking about our urning to feel passion in our everyday lives, despite the fact that our societies revolve around the fleeting pleasures we can grasp onto in life, without any actual \"creation\" - otherwise known as sodomy.\n\r\nAnd the rest has been basically said already.. I think this is one of the few Tool songs where the video actually has a lot to do with the lyrics. The black alien thing seems to represent the repressive and cunning aspect of humanity, while the little white doll is the innocent aspect just trying to figure things out. Notice how he's missing an eye, and his legs... the alien has seemingly taken away his main abilities to explore the world. The little white doll is also just another box in a big room of boxes, and the alien seems interested in figuring things out too.

The line \"I've come full circle,\" I've always interpreted to mean a literal coming full circle by abusing the one who had abused him before. In this light, I see the song as more about the disturbing catharsis one receives (or wants to receive) from unsympathetic revenge. Could very well be about cycles of abuse but I like to think of the song as being on a more personal, vengeful level. A kind of \"you did it to me now I'm going to do it to you\" vibe that's actually probably more disturbing than the cycles of abuse theory.

That is straight from church. Lamb and martyr, straight from sermon. People who feel sin, people who feel the need to be closer to their God have a NEED to push that religion onto someone else. Specifically, their children. They HAVE TO HAVE IT. It makes them feel whole. The closest I ever was with much of my family was when I was going to church with them at a young age.
