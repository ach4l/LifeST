I think this line: \"Thinking my journey's come to an end, oh/Sending out a farewell to my friends/Forever peace\" is very suicidal, so you can feel how Justin was feeling. I'm pretty sure this song is very personal to him. Then he asks for forgiveness to God, and shows how thankful he is for everything. This song is for God and also is for everyone who has felt like this or is getting through tough times .... It's so beautiful, ugh <3\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song is about how God gives us purpose in our lives. Without God, there is no purpose. We should all be very thankful to God who has blessed us with life and purpose. There is hope in Jesus Christ, the living God :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
