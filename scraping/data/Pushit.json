{"comment_0": "\nI can't believe everyone is obsessed with sex so much...it's true, some (very few, in fact, of maynard's TOOL songs have to do with sex...many more of his apc have to do with sex) TOOL songs have to do with sex as a metaphor or as an abuse (prison sex), etc., but most of Maynard's songs have intellectual meaning, philisophical meanings, ideological meanings...as does pushit.  Pushit simply has to do with Maynard's internal struggle with his past and that of religion (Christian Baptist in particular).  The infant mentioned in the song is in part himself in his youth and representative of the infant Jesus Christ.  The ideas and values preached to a young Maynard really confused him because of the abusive relationship his stepfather (the one who was preaching) had with him.  He associates a harmless, loving, defenseless infant with himself as a child, but he still hates himself for letting that abuse happen...he wants to get away from himself and that time in his life.  The infant haunts him...it's an image that stays with him always, partly from what was preached to him.  It's an image that tells him to love those who have wronged him (forgive them), an image that dictates the way he SHOULD (whether the right way or the wrong way) live his life but that he can't face up to because it is just to painful.  Jesus was abused in some of the most wicked ways and yet, he forgave all those who maimed him.  Maynard disagrees with this at the time this song was written.  He holds THE GRUDGE and wheres it like a crown.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nFor me this song, as with many tool songs is about breaking patterns of negative, and often abusive behaviour - whether it be towards the self, another person, or on a social level.  It says that the capacity to damage is often unintentional but inevitable if you dont actively overcome the negative aspects of yourself, whatever the cause of those traits is.\n\r\nThus pushit may be interpreted as a relationship whereby two personalities bring the worst out of each other even though they are apparently inseperable, and dependent on one another.  The only way to end the pattern is for both to die and be reborn.   \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI love the multiple ways you can interpret this song. You can see it, shallowly, about sex, wade into the waters and say it's about a complicated relationship between two lovers, or, as I prefer, you can dive deeply and say it's about the relationship between two characters within one body. These characters are fighting for control. Not necessarily two personalities as if he is a schitzo, but more so that you can't decide who you are or want to be and you change for other people and distort who you are for them, and then finally deciding to take control in the end, even if sometimes you loved your \"alternate person\" that you were pretending to be.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nMaynard himself said that this song is about identifying the cycle of abuse within yourself. The lyrics quite obviously show that. You may interpret the song in any way you wish, but the man himself already gave the meaning.\n\n\r\nSource: youtube.com/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI hate when people say Maynard is a god.  This sounds so stupid coming from an actual Tool fan.  He is a human being just like you or I.  Of couse he IS in the greatest band in the world, and has gone through life experiences that make him a person the we can learn from.  Although sometimes I wonder about Tool's true meaning.  never-the-less, there is some value to be seen in Tool songs, but not so much that we should follow him blindly!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nNever been a fan of conceptual art until TooL came around... Persons translate deep songs like Pushit the way it suits them, and everyone will find 'the right meaning' and 'the right way to interprete' lyrics in the right way to fit into his/her own mental 'device', due to their own preconceptions, frustrations, meanings etc.\r\nFor me, personally, this song has been the best introduction to the methods of Jung's theory of 'Reflective Cycology' :-)... which refers to 'phenomenom' of projecting your own virtues and lacks onto another person, making him/her reflection of yourself - just like Jesus said about 'thorn in someone's eye becomes a stick in your own eye' (or something like that, I'm sorry for this paraphrase). What it means is that what might bother you with one person is actually something that you might bother another person with.\r\n...like someone pointed previously about the inner struggle over/against oneself, I thought for Maynard that he addressed this song to himself : 'who am I to judge and strike you down' refers to what I previously wrote on Jung's theory... The thing is that I was the one addressing this song to myself, and if I hadn't learned important lesson on this projecting onto other persons, I quess I would become schyzophrenic, to say at least. ;-)\r\nSeriously, TooL did one hell of a job here and I'm glad that I really don't know what this song means for them... However, I recommend you all to find more on Jung, because I'm too lazy to write down here all the concepts on above mentioned, and it might be useful to someone who might, instead, post something originally on this topic.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nWhat we should all realize off the bat is that there were 2 different 'released' versions of this song.  In the live version (Salival) Maynard comments at the beginning of the track that they're going to play it differently because it means something new to them and that they want the energy of the crowd to help propel the interpretation along.\n\r\nThe original song (Aenima) can be interpreted many ways.  Yes, I agree (sometimes against my will), that it could be about anything from abuse (including self) to relationships, religion, health, etc.  I believe the song itself was crafted in such a personal and hidden way that we could all generalize until we're blue but never really touch the source of this incredible track.\n\r\nThe live version, however, is a different story (in my opinion).  Thank you F00L for transcribing this version for us (above).\n\r\nAllow me to be slightly long-winded due to the depth of the ideas I'm trying to express... hopefully you won't just scroll down to add your own opinion in haste.\n\r\nWith Maynard's declaration that they were \"trying to see this song from a different angle and under a different light\", it should be obvious that there was a breakthrough in regards to how they felt about this song in the few years they were touring after they had recorded and pressed it.  \n\r\nI guess, given the array of \"mental states\" or \"frames of mind\" (no, I'm not talking about drugs) you can be in on a tour, where you are playing similar set lists every night, it's inevitable that the songs that you have written from your deepest and/or darkest places will start to take new meaning.  Indeed, even the greatest artist will find new inspiration in his old work. (I think I'll coin that!)\n\r\nWith his plea to have the crowd grant him their collective feeling of vulnerability, I believe he had a very direct and essential message for all of us.  No, I am not saying that \"Maynard is God\" or a prophet, but I believe that if there were a band out there that could speak to that which is within us\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 below the surface\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it is Tool.   \n\r\nThus, I think Maynard really gave us a glimpse into our struggle.  I also believe he said it in the simplest way possible.  For those of you that are not familiar with the evolution of the body, mind and spirit, you should check out some Buddhist literature. Try \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Tibetan book of Living and Dying\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sogyal Rinpoche\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 (best source I can give while in the moment).\n\r\nI believe that this song (the live version) was written entirely about the evolution of the mind.  A lot of people have touched on topics of God in this forum, but I don't believe it's \u00e2\u0080\u0098God\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that he's speaking of/to... instead, it's his \u00e2\u0080\u0098higher self\u00e2\u0080\u0099.  There's a bit of gray between the 2 concepts that can cause confusion.\n\r\nIf you listen to this song as a message to his \u00e2\u0080\u0098higher self\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as it tries to pull him through to \"enlightenment\", or simply our next stage of growth, it makes a whole lot of serious sense.\n\r\nI don't know how many of you have a voice in your head that you know is your own but can't grasp how it actually sounds?  The one that speaks the words as you read to yourself, the one that you turn to when you're unsure... that little angel of good advice that you don't always take....\n\r\nI believe, as is not uncommon in spiritual circles across the world, that this is our very outlet to the divine.  Or brief reflection of ourselves in a higher consciousness.\n\r\nI believe that his song is a very direct and very focused spotlight on the struggle between the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Higher Self\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and the Ego (see Freud or any Buddhist literature for dynamic ideas on the function/identification of the notion).\n\r\nThe Ego itself is the dominant mental structure in our every-day lives.  The Buddhists say that it's the veil in which covers the line between the corporeal and the enlightened.  It's that which blinds us and tricks us into remaining in this evolutionary state until we literally hatch from the egg.  The Ego is our egg shell, that which protects us at a very basic level and allows us to grow without the pressures and mind-blowing intensity that is \u00e2\u0080\u0098God\u00e2\u0080\u0099.  \n\r\nEven though the Ego tends to hold some people back (those who grow very quickly inside the shell) it is completely essential in our evolution... as important as the brain, the heart and the lungs.  \n\r\nAs much as it is necessary, it is also very tricky.  It has the ability to fool all of the senses, to shut you down if it needs to... to direct your train of thought as you drift away.  We give full control of ourselves to this innate consciousness and handfuls of us come to realize it entirely.  \n\r\nWhen we start to wake up, it's terrifying... like being pushed from the womb.  We are about to undertake reality-shattering events that will re-construct everything we thought we knew.  \n\r\nIn order to cross through to the next layer of reality/consciousness, we have to be able to leave the womb behind... and that is one of the hardest things a human being can be asked to do.  Just look at how we react as babies when we are born and how we deal with the world as we learn and grow.  Life a we know it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always the easiest place to exist.\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is that we can't stay in the shell forever, regardless of how comfortable or familiar it becomes.  The shell (Ego) will ultimately become too small or narrow for our expanding mental/spiritual capacity as humans.  \n\r\nWe have to come to terms with the idea and ease ourselves through the passing, as not to cause ourselves any more shock than necessary.  When I hear this song and I think this way, it makes me realize that \u00e2\u0080\u009call of this pain really is an illusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d... that we should embrace our evolution and start to 'question authority' (ego) regardless of how often this authority attempts to trick us into staying.  It is just our reflection.\n\r\nAs you can tell, I'm very passionate about this song and the truth that rings through me every time I hear it.  Hopefully there's at least one other person out there that shares the same perspective.  If not, sorry for wasting your time.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nThe Yin Yang sums up these lyrics pretty well.

'Pushit' is one of the songs on _AEnima_ to deal with this.  \"I saw the gap again today / while you were begging me to stay\"----he's realizing there's an emotional distance between him and his partner, and the way she's dealing with it is controlling, demeaning, and abusive, and that trying to force him to stay through intimidation or threats isn't true caring, since \"there's no love in fear\".  But the relationship has resulted in a child that he has to accept---\"choke this infant here before me / what is this but my reflection?\"  This relationship is also addressed on _AEnima_ in the song \"H.\", where he's telling his partner that he's \"too connected\" to her \"to slip/fade away,\" and that she's \"considerately killing\" him.

It isnt right, just as noone elses interpretations are right, but neither are they wrong. they are what they mean to you.\r\nOk my belief is that this song is about being in love with someone. You love this person but they hurt you, and they are aware that they hurt you, they use your weakness to there advantage, they abuse you. They push and shove you at there convenience.  You only are with them because what they do to you may hurt you, but it secures you and they feed on this. They konw you wont leave because you love them too much and are too comfortable in the relationship.  The only thing the abuser is willing to give you is sex, to satisfy you.  But soon this whole ordeal becomes akward, and then annoying, and person has pushed you to the brim:\r\n\"Put me somewhere I don't wanna be \r\nSeeing someplace I don't wanna see \r\nNever wanna see that place again \"\n\r\nthen you realize that this person is only going to tear you apart, so you push yourself away from them, and everyone else:\r\n\"Saw that gap again today \r\nAs you were begging me to stay \r\nManaged to push myself away, \r\nAnd you, as well my dear\"\r\nThen you explain to the person why you feel that this whole relationship is abusive to you:\n\r\n\"If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay, \r\nYou minimize my movement anyway, \r\nI must persuade you another way \n\r\nThere's no love in fear \"\n\r\n\"Staring down the hole again \r\nHands upon my back again \r\nSurvival is my only friend \r\nTerrified of what may come \n\r\nJust remember I will always love you, \r\nEven as I tear your fucking throat away \r\nBut it will end no other way\"\r\nNow the fear comes into play, you want to leave, but shes pulling you in\" Hands upon my back again, and terrified of what may come\" Then the last lines, he breaks from the fear and ends the abusive relationship.\n\n\n\n", "comment_46": "\ni totally agree with movedbytool\r\ni understand this song to be about someone who is afraid to love and in doing so, he/she pushes said other away. pulls him/herself away.\r\n\"There's no love in fear\"\r\nif you are afraid to love, wouldn't you push it away\n\n\r\n-laynerox\r\ni know i do\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_47": "\nI think that this song is about life and authority specifically school and parents.

I think it's about heroin in particular. Here's my analysis:\n\r\nI will choke until I swallow... \r\nChoke this infant here before me \r\nWhat is this but my reflection? \r\nWho am I to judge and strike you down? \r\nI think this verse he is talking about his consciense, and how its a little voice (infant) in the back of his head thats telling him that heroin is bad, but he doesnt listen (chokes) that voice away.\n\r\nBut you're \r\nPushing and shoving me \r\nYou still love me and you pushit on me \r\nThis is his addiction acting on him. He is saying that the drugs (referred to as 'you') are making him use them.\n\r\nRest your trigger on my finger, \r\nbang my head upon the fault line \r\nTake care not to make me enter \r\n'cause if I do we both may disappear \r\nI think the trigger is the needle's plunger, and he rests his finger on it to inject. The fault line, i believe, is referring to the tracks that the needle leaves after repeated use.\n\r\nBut you're pushing me, \r\nShoving me \r\nPushit on me \r\nBack to his addition forcing him to use the drugs.\n\r\nSlipping back into the gap again \r\nI'm alive when you're touching me, \r\nAlive when you're shoving me down \r\nThe first line has too meanings i think. One could be the needle being pushed (slipping) into his veins again. The second could be he wants to get away from the addiction, but it wont let him and he keeps slipping back into doing it. The alive part means he feels so alive when the heroin is entering his body.\n\r\nBut i'd trade it all \r\nFor just a little bit of \r\nPeace of mind \r\nThis is when he says he really wants to give up the addiction so he can just have some peace.\n\r\nPut me somewhere I don't wanna be \r\nSeeing someplace I don't wanna see \r\nNever wanna see that place again \r\nI think this either refers to a relapse, or it can be him thinking back to when he was high on the h.\n\r\nSaw that gap again today \r\nAs you were begging me to stay \r\nManaged to push myself away, \r\nAnd you, as well \r\nI think is him looking at his arm and seeing the needle's track and remembering what he used to do with it. He's saying that it's begging him to use h again, but he manages to somehow resist the urge.\n\r\nIf, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay, \r\nYou minimize my movement anyway, \r\nI must persuade you another way \r\nI'm not really sure on this verse. Maybe something about the h making him less of a person.\n\r\nThere's no love in fear \r\nThis is when the h starts making him paranoid and he's afraid all the time. He's tell the h that he can't love it if all it does is make him afraid/paranoid.\n\r\nStaring down the hole again \r\nHands upon my back again \r\nSurvival is my only friend \r\nTerrified of what may come \r\nI think this is where it really makes me think the song is about h. Staring down the hole again, i believe, refers to him looking at the needle, and looking down it's sharp end. The hands part i think feeds more into the paranoia, like how he's always looking over his shoulder. Or it could also show that he's helpless (hands on my back could be referancing handcuffs). The survival part could mean two things: One that he's got to not do h if he's going to survive, and the other being that he has to do h in order to survive, because if he doesnt he'll die from withdrawal. The last line is adding to the survival part, because theres a negative outcome either way so he's afraid of whats going to become of him.  \n\r\nJust remember I will always love you, \r\nEven as I tear your fucking throat away \r\nBut it will end no other way\r\nThis part i can only theorize on. I think the first line is him telling the h that he loves it, but in a love/hate kind of way. The second line has me confused, i think you can see it as him saying he's going to tear away the h's throat and finally be free from it, or it could mean that the only way to be free from it would be to tear away his own throat (commit suicide). The last line is just saying that he has to do it, because he has no choice.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_49": "\nI've read some of these comments before, but I can't be bothered to now.  I'll just stick my interpretation on here...\n\r\nBasically, the whole feeling I get is of an abusive relationship.  But emotionally, not physically.  The speakers partner forces them to do whatever they want them to.  I believe that there could be an element of sexual abuse here, as in \"Alive when you're touching me/Alive when you're shoving me down\".  I see this as a reference to the speaker enjoying the physical side of the relationship, but still being forced into it.  Maybe they are trying to hold onto a belief that they are in control, but they know that they are not.\n\r\nThe speaker has assumed the submissive role for too long, and feels that it is time to break away.  The first part of the song I see as the routine and what has happened this far.  The middle section is reflection and realisation, and calmly stepping back to observe the situation.  The last, faster and more aggressive section is the solution and resolution.  Thus the speaker will break the cycle and regain his(/her) freedom once again.\n\r\nThere's probably more, but...eh.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_50": "\nThis is a little odd, but I had this insight yesterday.  I read someone's view on here that the song could be about heroin addiction, and I think that maybe it could be, but from the perspective of the actual drug.\n\r\nLines like \"take care not to make me enter\" is the drug warning the addict of what will happen if he persists with his usage (\"we both may disappear\")\n\r\n\"bang my head upon the fault line\" as a track mark reference makes more sense to me from the heroin's point of view.  \"Saw that gap again today/While you were begging me to stay\" again is showing the dependence of the addict as he can't live without the drug.\n\n\r\n\"But you're pushing and shoving me/You still love me and pushit on me\" is the same, I guess.  The junkie feels like he loves the drug and forces use.  It's a little weird, as much of the lyrics would seem like the heroin resents the frequent usage, but it's something that I think could fit.  \"Put me somewhere I don't wanna be\" is resentment again.  \"Fade like a sigh\" and \"disappear\" can be references to the drug dissolving into the blood stream.\n\r\nIt's a weird relationship, like a love/hate thing.  \"Remember I'll always love you/If I claw your fucking throat away\" is how the drug loves the user, but knows it will ultimately be his death.  Oooh, new insight!  The song is about how the drug loves the junkie, but doesn't want him to use it as he doesn't want the junkie to die!\n\r\nOn second thoughts, that made no sense at all...\n\r\nWhatever.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_51": "\nI'm also sure the chorus says \"You're shooting me\" in it, when I listen to it I hear that.

It could suggest that the woman wants to have a kid (the greatest act of love) and that the guy is afraid that sort of emotional and physical commitment will kill his identity and life as he currently enjoys it.  The trigger and faultline suggest a coitus interruptus because he's afraid of the commitment a baby will bring.  She limits him with this narrow minded coercion and he fears the commitment and thus her for doing so.  Cesaro Summability = mathematical equation of two infinite entities converging.  Two people becoming one identity.  That identity is the baby you hear crying in Cesaro Summability.  \n\r\nThats what I love about the lyrics.  Makes you think.  Therey is probably no right answer.

The next line implys he'd be somewhat hypocritical to expect better treatment. \n\r\n\"But you're\r\nPushing and shoving me\r\nYou still love me and you pushit on me\"\n\r\nThe desire for a relationship is existant in the partner, however not taken as seriously as it should be.  \n\r\n\"Rest your trigger on my finger,\r\nbang my head upon the fault line\r\nTake care not to make me enter\r\n'cause if I do we both may disappear\"\n\r\nThe first two lines metaphorically narrate the physiological pain. He's then talks about entering, which is basically about entering and trying to change the ways of the partner for the better of the two. The last line here expresses that if the true complaints are voiced, he may be risking the relationship. \n\r\n\"But you're pushing me,\r\nShoving me\r\nPushit on me\"\n\r\nMore narration of the pain. \n\r\n\"Slipping back into the gap again\r\nI'm alive when you're touching me,\r\nAlive when you're shoving me down\"\n\r\nThe first line is telling how he is falling back into the experience again, or reflecting upon it. He feels the positive emotion (touching me) and the negative emotion (shoving me down). \n\r\n\"But i'd trade it all\r\nFor just a little bit of\r\nPiece of mind\"\n\r\nAll of this creates such an emotional roller coaster that he's just talking about having a little piece of mind. \n\r\n\"Put me somewhere I don't wanna be\r\nSeeing someplace I don't wanna see\r\nNever wanna see that place again\"\n\r\nThis all puts him in a negative place (state of mind). He dosen't want to see it, and he never wants to have to go through it again. \n\r\n\"Saw that gap again today\r\nAs you were begging me to stay\r\nManaged to push myself away,\r\nAnd you, as well\"\n\r\nThe gap, again is the actual experience. \"Begging me to stay\", I take this very diffrently, the partner of the speaker wants to leave him and go hang out with other people, however the partner does not want the speaker to follow. The speaker tells how he managed to push his desire to follow away(myself), and also momentarily rid the lonely and betrayed feelings(you).\n\r\n\"If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,\r\nYou minimize my movement anyway,\r\nI must persuade you another way\"\n\r\nThe first line talks about him fading into a chaotic depression if he \"stays\" (as in the last verse). If he trys to complain he \"minimizes his movement\"; stops it by not paying attention or not taking it into consideration. The speaker then reveals his desire to make it come through some other way. Out of sheer desperation. \n\r\n\"There's no love in fear\"\n\r\nHere; \"fear\" is not taken literally but rather as distrust or disharmony. \n\r\n\"Staring down the hole again\r\nHands upon my back again\r\nSurvival is my only friend\r\nTerrified of what may come\"\n\r\nThe first two lines express the same negative emotions that have already plagued him so many times. He talks of his need to survive and get through this. He is terrified of what may come, implying probable rejection in one way or another.\n\r\n\"Just remember I will always love you,\r\nEven as I tear your fucking throat away\r\nBut it will end no other way\"\n\r\nHe expresses in the first line that even though he has been hurt, he still gives his love to his partner. \"Even as I tear your fucking throat away\", here this is not interpreted as literally killing his partner, but rather finally just letting his partner know fully of all his contempts with him. He says this array of negativity will not end until this is done. \n\n\r\nAgain, I don't really expect anyone else except me to be able to identify with this meaning, which is alright because it's my own. Know that this was not just thought up, I spent alot of time to find metaphorical meanings to suit myself in this. And it does all make sense, so there's another valid meaning for you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_74": "\nThe one fairly constant interpretation is that this song is about a destructive relationship which you're unable to leave but know you must.\n\r\nMaynard is no god, but he's talented.

Part of the reason that he is unable to escape is that he fully understands that he is not completely innocent himself (\"What is this but my reflection, who am I to judge or strike you down?\")  But I think that he is also warning that he can only be pushed so far by saying rest your trigger on my finger, Bang my head upon the faultline.  Better take care not to make me enter, if I do we both may disappear.  He's saying that if you keep on testing him, thinking he is weak and just leaving your trigger on his finger daring him to pull it, banging his head on the fault line until he finally loses it and pulls you into the void with him.  Then the line \"slipping back into the gap again, I'm alive when your touching me, alive when your shoving me down.\"  Indicates that he has been down before and the person this song is directed at was the one to help him out of the hole and now that person is no longer helpful but is actually hurting him now and he can't let go because he needs salvation now and that person was the only one to offer that salvation.  So here he is caught in a stressful place where his mind is torn between what he should do and what he wishes could be.  The only thing that makes him aware of himself (alive) is when she is touching him or shoving him down.  So now he just needs the attention from this other person whether it be positive or negative, but he'd trade it all for just a little peace of mind.  He'd give anything not to be torn that way anymore. And finally the line \"If when I see I might fade like a sigh if I stay, You minimize my movement anyway, I must persuade you another way.  Means that if he realizes that his true self is disappearing, and he stays anyway, then he must persuade the other person to change.  Which I think makes a point in itself that since he doesn't say I must leave, instead of I must change you.  It just further illustrates his dependance on the other person.  Hence he is afraid to leave.  And there is no love in fear.  This means that love and fear cannot exist simultaneoously in the same spirit.  You do not fear that which you love because if love is true love there is also trust and faith.  But in the end he can't take it anymore and is too weak to leave, the only way out is for him to murder her, but he still cares so much that he makes certain to tell her one last time that even as he kills her he LOVES HER.

The whole album of Undertow, to me, screamed with peadophilic connotations and Aenima seems to be a slow and painful journey of actually grabbing that bullshit trauma that destroys so many lives, pulling it into the open, and finally making peace and saying goodbye forever.  \n\r\n46 & 2 and Jimmy to me coincide with this as well - it is completely about \"shedding skin\" and throwing off the shackles, but first one must look it in the eye, forgive it, then say goodbye.  I have had debilitating experiences with my father (not sexual) and it wasn't until the age of 24 that I could really gather where his actions were coming from because I myself was mimicking them in my own relationships and dealings (who is this but my reflection?).  \n\r\nThen of course it leads to \"so what was my grandfather like, and great grandfather\" and so on and so forth.  What's the fucken point of finding someone to blame and \"point the finger\" - its about acceptance, forgiveness and ultimately moving beyond.  The pheonix from the flames.\n\r\nTo me I see Lateralus as cathartic - the first three albums had quite a bit of anger to them, but Aenima, by the end, that anger does seem to have been worked through quite intently.  I see Lateralus as a reference point as to how to move on after trauma in a way that is not only beneficial to you, but to everyone.

It is hard to swallow and it is hard to understand a different concept of what we are and why we are here....until you are able to swallow it. Lateralus gave us a great view of what Maynard believes and what I am saying is nothing new to a true tool fan. We are eternal all this pain is an illusion. This song is about his fight to push away the illusions and accept the reality of existence. \n\r\n\"There's no Love in Fear\"... Religion teaches that god should be feared, it teaches us that if we do not obey God we will be punished by being sent to Hell but God is supposed to be the embodiment of LOVE he is all the love in the world. The source that we exist in and the source of all that is, was and ever will be. \n\r\nOnce you stop thinking about God as a person and instead of a source of energy and knowledge you will realize what level Maynard writes his songs on. \n\r\nWe are choosing to be here, right now, hold on, stay inside, this body, this body holding me, feeling eternal all this pain is an illusion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_98": "\nWhat the fuck are we to rate whatever song?

Surely Maynard himself knows what each and every song really means, but again, he leaves this open to his listeners. \n\r\nI just got out of a relationship in which I can basically directly relate to this song...

I've read some great interpretations, like it's about God or relationships. The one sentence that pops out for me is: \"There's no love in fear\". The two are actually opposites, like black and white. As a reference watch the movie Donnie Darko. And just like black and white, there are many grey zones between them. It's the same with love and fear, they are the deepest human emotions, but they're just the opposite ends of the whole spectrum of human emotions. I can also relate a lot of the song in a relationship with a girl a had a year earlier. She was my first girlfriend, a very nice girl who loved me so much that I was the one for her. First problem: I didn't feel the same. I did love her and we were happy for a while, but she loved me more than I loved her. And there comes a moment where fear takes over, you're not sure she's the one for you, you don't feel comfortable in this relationship anymore. She's still loves me so much, but it's killing me inside and it pushes me away from her. I couldn't handle the situation anymore, because it was tearing me apart, and I knew I would feel more secure and comfortable if I broke up with her. I didn't want to hurt her feelings, but I had no other choice. Even though I broke her heart, I felt relieved, it was a burden coming off my shoulders. \n\r\nThat's not how I interpret this song, it's how I FEEL it. Though I've read other interesting interpretations, like someone who said it involves your faith in God, not that he is a person, but a natural force, and nature is not just around us, it's also inside of us. The fact that we are here, and can think for ourselves and help others, is a gift. God creates, but humans create too. We create art, we create our own life like we want it. \r\nI know it looks like most people don't know what life is really about, and there are a lot bad things happening in the world, but guess what. We have the ability to change, we can live together as one. Maybe the biggest flaw in humans is ignorance, it's a bless and a curse. But ignorance can be stopped by delivering the right information to people. If they decide to ignore it then they are not ignorant anymore but dumb. If you act upon it, you're learning and then you become wiser. \r\nI don't know what's going to happen in the future, but I believe that the world is going to change, because more and more people are searching for spirituality and balance, and I think that's where our salvation is. Just believe in the greater good and in yourself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_111": "\nthe lyrics that this website has matches tool's official website lyrics.

He feels that he is nothing usually, but when he gets this struggling \"gap\" going on it gives him what he feels is real feeling, a real personality based on just what his other personality is trying to do to him, causing havoc in his mind. \n\r\nHe talks about trading anything for peace of mind, how he abuses himself over and over again, and he just wants to get through it (\"Hands on my back again, survival is my only friend\")\n\r\nIn the end of the song, he talks of just ending it. Speaking to the other half of him, he decides to end it Fight Club style, you have to take yourself out, to get rid of the other. There is no other way, after all.\n\r\nBut then again, music is art, and art is interpretation.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_135": "\ni think this song is about abortion and how he doesn't want to have the baby in his life but the girl does...just my opinion...its probably wrong\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_136": "\nEVERlast5150, That is EXACTLY how i interpret the song. \n\r\nKarkeltron said this about the song, Which I believe to strengthen the argument that this song is about a child out of wedlock and the differences in opinion that can result.\"\"Rest your trigger on my finger\" which is the opinionated person starting the conflict and not yourself. Whereas the \"fault line\" is the difference between the yourself and them, thus they're banging your head upon it trying to change you. Finally \"take care not to make me enter\" and \"cause if I do we both may disappear\" go hand-in-hand because letting yourself be swayed by the opinionated person would result in no differentiation between the two of you.\" \n\r\nThe line, \"what is this? but my reflection\" means the child he helped create is going to be a \"reflection\" of him, but asking \"what is this?\" makes it seem like he does not love the child but he sees it as more of a mistake that he feels should be handled by abortion.\n\r\nNext line, \"Who am i to judge or strike you down?\" He is saying how can i tell you to abort your child, it may be against her family's religious views or she might be ready to be mother. Its ultimately her choice.  \n\r\nIn the intro he foreshadows the situation by saying \"Saw that gap again today, while you were beggin' me to stay\" The gap meaning the distance he will make with the child and mother should she decide to keep it, and  while hes thinking about taking action she wants him to stay in the picture as the father.\n\r\nI dont have time to go through lyric by lyric but i feel that the whole song is about his struggle to deal with the idea of having a baby too soon in his life going back and forth with his decision to stay or leave. ending with his decision to kill both the mother and not yet born child, saying it will end no other way...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_137": "\nBTW I heard this song for the first time today in almost 4 years and I could not help but well up during the climax of the song, So much emotion ran though me i don't know how Maynard can perform these songs and not become emotional on stage.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_138": "\nI really think this song is refering to shooting heroin. \"Rest your trigger on my finger\" refers to the plunger on the needle. \"Bang my head upon the faultline\" refers to being on the verge of overdose.

I think that there are two people in a relationship that's frighteningly intense.  they are very sexual and love each other but at the same time the guy ( maynard? )  is scared of this relationship because if you're like me, love, true love, is scary as hell.  you can't take it and you feel bad by the physical act of love.  now I also think there is an underlying topic in the song.  the \" i will choke until i swallow, choke this infant here before me\" part.  the first part is clearly fear.  the second part may be a stretch on my part but i always interpret this as a lyric pointing towards a pregnancy and him wanting an abortion based on his indecision.  now what could be worse or more intense?  intense love, fear, commitment, second thoughts, a child, and knowing that if you stay you'll go numb ( \"disappear\") and if you go you'll regret.  there is no piece of mind.  and i think we'd all feel like trading it for a little piece of that.  Maynard is not a god.  he is extremely talented lyrically and sings amazingly for a band that compliments him perfectly.  and i'll be perfectly ok with being wrong.  then again, that doesnt matter, does it?  i'll never change my mind.  to tell the truth, if maynard himself told me the meaning and it was completely different than how i interpret the song, i probably would'nt like it as much.  i've already applied it to my life if you could'nt already tell and that's how i like it.  it has meaning to me as much as it probably does to maynard himself.  different maybe, but equal all the same\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_141": "\nbasically, what fortysix and two said.  wow.  i wasnt completely focused when i wrote but they were.  so yeah.  we're pretty much awesome.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_142": "\ni agree with joshthank\r\nmaynard is NOT God, he is human!\r\nalthough he is the most talented and most beautiful voice in the WORLD!!!! i dont think he should be worshiped either because your worshipping one of your kind.but yeah... all his songs are brilliant! amazing! outstanding!!! i love this song!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_143": "\nTool teaches us to look at the details, not to scratch the surface and be satisfied.\n\r\nIt seem to me (without cruel intention) many try to make an interpretation based on a glimpse or quote from Maynard or anyone in the band.

It seems that he loves the person but that person is so fearfully attached to him that it pushes him away and he detaches from the situation emotionally in order to refrain from acting violently or otherwise. Maybe he does not know exactly what to do so it's his only option. \n\n\"Take care not to make me enter. \n'Cause if I do we both may disappear.\"\n\nHe could react violently and kill them both in order to end the vicious cycle.\n\n\"Slipping back into the gap again.\nI'm alive when you're touching me,\nAlive when you're shoving me down.\nBut I'd trade it all\nFor just a little bit of\nPiece of mind.\"\n\nHe becomes alive, or fully consciously and emotionally present when she emotionally affects him, even if it is in a negative way. As said before, in order to get peace he has to detach from the situation emotionally. He would rather be fully present, but without the emotional pain or worry arising from other person's fearful attachment to him. The other person will not understand, or fulfill his desire or right to have his own personal space.\n\n\"Saw that gap again today\nAs you were begging me to stay.\nManaged to push myself away,\nAnd you, as well.\"\n\nHe detaches emotionally, or dissociates. From both how he feels and how the other person feels.\n\n\"If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,\nYou minimize my movement anyway,\nI must persuade you another way.\"\n\nHe says if he tells her that he just may fade like a sigh, or dissociate emotionally, and she minimizes his personal space and freedom anyway, that he must persuade her another way... even if by force, as we find out further into the song:\n\n\"There's no love in fear.\"\n\nHer fear that he will leave is actually pushing him away. Now he is desperate to escape the situation because she is so focused on her attachment to him that they cannot have any other type of experience but a fearful one. This is not love. It's selfish fearful attachment.\n\n\"Staring down the hole again.\nHands upon my back again.\nSurvival is my only friend.\nTerrified of what may come.\"\n\nHer hands are on his back because she is pushing him away. Survival is the only thing he can find comfort in, because he does not know what will come of the situation and fears the worst because of her lack of understanding and cooperation. \n\n\"Just remember I will always love you,\nEven as I tear your fucking throat away.\nBut it will end no other way.\"\n\nHe reassures her that he will always love her. The fact that he has to reassure her implies that she is fearful that he doesn't actually love her. There is no love in fear as he stated earlier. He decides to use force in order to break the vicious cycle because she isn't cooperating/allowing it to end any other (peaceful) way.\n\nI skipped the first verse because for me it's self-explanitory, but I cannot find the words to interpret it into.

If you listen to Weak and Powerless by APC, you'll get the references. Talking about the hole, being pushed down the hole, that's representing the addiction. Just imagine yourself in a relationship, where the two of you are addicted to something, heroin, alcohol, cutting, whatever. The two of you are hopelessly addicted. One of you, the one whose perspective is sung through this song, wants out. Not necessarily out of the relationship, but from the addiction. But you can't get away, the other person keeps pushing it on you. \n\n\"I will choke until I swallow\nChoke this infant here before me.\nWhat is this but my reflection?\nWho am I to judge and strike you down?\"\n\n\"This infant\" he's referring to is the other person, his partner, or maybe this other person in his mind, as you are your own worst enemy when you have an addiction, the infant is someone that he created. The other person, the other voice inside of his mind, the addict that he's created, his \"child\". \n\"What is this but my reflection? Who am I to judge and strike you down?\" He feels responsible for the outcome, so feels guilty for judging the other entity.\n\n\"But you're\nPushing and shoving me.\nYou still love me and you push it on me.\nRest your trigger on my finger,\nBang my head upon the fault line.\nTake care not to make me enter.\nCause if I do we both may disappear.\"\nRest your trigger on my finger, easy. Pushing the addiction back onto the person. \"Take care not to make me enter, cause if I do, we both may disappear.\" The addiction will destroy them if they \"enter the hole\" again.\n\n\"There's no love in fear.\nStaring down the hole again.\nHands upon my back again.\nSurvival is my only friend.\nTerrified of what may come.\nJust remember I will always love you,\nEven as I tear your fucking throat away.\nBut it will end no other way.\"\nHe decides the only thing to do is to destroy this other entity or person or voice that he's created that he loves. He feels he loves this other person, but he realizes there's no love in fear, if he feels afraid for his own safety, then how can that be love?\n\nThis is a beautiful song from the mind of someone who has obviously felt the clutch of addiction or somebody very close to him. As with quite a few \"Maynard\" songs, about addiction. 'Stinkfist', 'Weak and Powerless', 'The Package', 'Pushit'. Beautiful.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_183": "\nI have come to believe that this song is about the struggle of a new father who was sexually abused as a child by his own father.  I think this story is told in pieces through the songs Prison Sex, Jimmy, H., and Pushit.  This song in particular is the fear of inflicting the same abuse onto his own son.  As a child of abuse there is still love for the abuser.  He knows that he must destroy in his own heart and mind any of the twisted views of this abuser as a father figure and someone who loved him.

I believe it's written in a chronological order. The infant mjk describes is the nievity of love and the notion that love is a fairy tale and choking the infant is the reliasation or reality that love is sometimes and in this case cruel and destructive. It's also about a power struggle hence the reference to a fault line or weak point which he describes as forcing through or hitting to gain control. He describes being so infatuated that he is losing his own identity and losing himself. The gap he describes is a way out but he's so infatuated and weakened by this relationship he can't see any other way out other than killing the other person! Such an insightful, complex and powerful track. This of course is the nutshell version of my interpretation.

Make me enter is entering back into a relationship after breaking up or trying to stay away from it because it's bad or unhealthy type of relationship to the point where both won't be making any progress is they decide to stay together. May disappear = no progress = no point. \n\n\"You know that I will choke until I swallow\nChoke this infant here before me\nWhat is this but my reflection?\nWho am I to judge or strike you down?\"\n\nNow there was someone who mentioned this was about Maynard's childhood of abuse and I can definitely see that being the point, esp. if these lyrics are straightforward rather than analytical. If it's not about his childhood, I think it's another form of expressing how much of a pushover he has been in the relationship \"I will choke until I swallow\" and it's making him feel like an immature infant in the relationship since he depended to much on the other person. \"Who am I to judge or strike you down?\" Either way, whether he's referring to himself, both of them, or the other person in the relationship, he doesn't feel as if he can fight back or hold anything against the person for what he/she has done in their relationship.\n\n\"But you're pushing me shoving me\nYou still love me\nYou still love me but you didn't need to shit on me...\nShe didn't mean to pushit on me\"\n\nShe messed up. She keeps trying. She's not trying to let him go. She still loves him even though she keeps doing things in the relationship that are messed up.

He's realizing that not even the sex is enough to keep him to stay.\n\n\"You're pushing and shoving and scrambling \nKeep my feet flat on the ground\nI am somewhere I don't wanna be\nPush me somewhere I don't wanna be\nPut me somewhere I don't wanna be\nSeeing someplace I don't wanna see\nNever wanna see that place again\"\n\nAren't you all getting a bit annoyed and frustrated reading this? Imagine how he feels. He's trying to tell her that he's done. He doesn't want to be with her. He isn't happy with her, living with her, it's done. He's pretty much done at this point and he's officially accepted it to the point where he's putting his foot down. He's not going to let her manipulate him, guilt-trip him, or persuade him to get back together.\n\n\"Saw that gap again today\nWhile you were begging me to stay\nManaged to push myself away\nAnd you, as well, my dear\"\n\nHe realized there's only a dark future ahead if he moves forward in the relationship.

There's no love in fear as in they can't be afraid to let each other go because it is scary to be alone, scary to know what's to happen next after you lose someone. He does love her, but it's just not working out, and since she doesn't, since she won't accept it and won't let him go, he has no choice but to stop being a pushover and make the tough call to leave her, and leaving her is such a hard thing to do (esp. for a pushover) that it felt like he was clawing her throat away, actually having to hurt her so he could get out of that situation, even though he tried to do it in nicer other ways, she left him with no choice.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_189": "\nThis song is about the push and pull of an abusive relationship (physical or emotional, all of the above). the \"gap\" being referred to in the song is the disassociation one begins to feel after repeated abuse and becoming fed up.\n\nBut in this song, it talks about how there is something that brings the person back into the relationship, being too weak to walk away and stay away from it. \n\nThe final line refers to the idea that the only way this situation will end is if the person finally loses control and attacks back.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_190": "\nFinding comfort in the abuse because it's what you know of a life, but recognizing another way.Piece of mind.\r\nI see this abuse within myself, but I am trying to break it and you won't let me.I see distance between us.

But he loves it when she touches him and he loves it when he getting oral sex from her.\n\r\nThe sixth verse:\"But i'd trade it all \r\nFor just a little bit of \r\nPiece of mind\"\r\nHe would love it if they did more then just have sex all the time, but thats all she wants to do, he would trade it all for just a little peace of mind.\n\r\nThe seventh verse:\"Put me somewhere I don't wanna be \r\nSeeing someplace I don't wanna see \r\nNever wanna see that place again\"\r\nNow this is where he has got so into the oral/manual stimulation from his lover that he want to have \"normal\" sex with her, because he has just about lost it.\n\r\nThe eighth verse: \"Saw that gap again today \r\nAs you were begging me to stay \r\nManaged to push myself away, \r\nAnd you, as well\"\r\nHis lover wanted it again, she was begging him for it, but he managed to escape before he lost it, but in doing so pushed her away from him.\n\r\nThe Ninth verse: \"If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay, \r\nYou minimize my movement anyway, \r\nI must persuade you another way\"\r\nBut if he says anything about how he doesn't want \"normal\" sex then his relationship with her will just be very shallow, they'll just sit around and do nothing. But she doesn't let him do much anyway. If only he could find a way to get her to stop.\n\r\nThe tenth verse: \"There's no love in fear\"\r\nHe can't truley love her if he is afraid of her in totality.\n\r\nThe eleventh verse: \"Staring down the hole again \r\nHands upon my back again \r\nSurvival is my only friend \r\nTerrified of what may come\"\r\nShe is doing it again, she wants it again, but he must escape he must not go insane, he knows what he must do to make it stop.\n\r\nThe final verse: \"Just remember I will always love you, \r\nEven as I tear your fucking throat away \r\nBut it will end no other way\"\r\nHe has to kill her to make it stop, but he still loves her, this is the only way.\n\r\nTruley one of the greatest songs ever. My favorite Tool song has to be Pushit (Live) and Pushit.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_202": "\n28.media.tumblr.com/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_203": "\nMental disorder and suicide.\r\nI've always felt that this about a duel personality disorder. Two personalities where one is child like and submissive and the other is the authoritarian forcing his demands. A bit like spiegal and gollum. However the child sees the gap again (suicide) which is his escape and peace of mind. The authoritarian has the ability to manipulate particularly through fear and any other emotion to get what he wants. He can even beg if its required. And it's all out of what he claims to be love.\r\nIf the child enters the gap, they both will disappear.\n\r\n\"There's no love in fear\" - I always think of this line when the kids get me upset. Another MJK gem and a wonderful message whoever the source.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_204": "\nI honestly think, that like so many other Tool songs this is about sex. \n\nMore specifically, I think it's about pulling out cause he doesn't want a kid and in the heat of passion he's finding it difficult to pull out.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
