In the song it says that people will try to bring you down but don't let them.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nAriana dislikes this song and thought it was a nightmare.  She also hated the video where she explained she \"got a fake spray tan and was put into a dress in the middle of the street\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song is great and if Ariana worked on this song again I would be so happy\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
