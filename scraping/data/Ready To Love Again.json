{"comment_0": "\nThis is a beautiful song, and extremely easy to relate to for me.\r\nI dated a boy, my best friend, for two years.\r\nWe broke up in April, and I never thought that I would get past it.\r\nBut now there's a new boy..and I'm ready to love again. (:\r\nThat sounds really dumb, but this song is saying that things will get better.\r\nAnd they have for me.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nPretty straightforward. Ready to love again after a previous failed relationship. Sweet and really soothing. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nthe meaning is pretty obvious.\r\na failed relationship left an empty and broken heart and just when they thought that they would never be complete, \r\nthey realize that they're ready to love someone else.\r\nit's a super sweet song ^_^\r\nshows you that in hard times, there's always hope.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nFor me and my relationship, this song has a lot of meaning.\n\r\nMy husband and I are currently separated but working on things, trying to make it work.  For me, this song is about losing who you are in a relationship and putting up walls.  But as time goes on, you realize you have to let those walls go and be ready and willing to love again.  \r\nThis verse says a lot about the person who feels like they lost themselves\r\n\"Just when you think that love will never find you\r\nYou run away but still it's right behind you, oh\r\nIt's just something that we can't control\"\r\nThe person who is still there, loving the person who left...you run away but still it's right behind you.\n\r\nI dont know. Maybe I am way off base here but it make sense to me given my current situation.  \n\r\nAnyone agree?\n\n\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI am ready. :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
