{"comment_0": "\nCheers to Bentol and others:\n\r\nNo one mentioned that \"Red Right Hand\" is from\r\nJohn Milton's \"Paradise Lost\".\n\r\nThis is even spelled out on another Nick Cave album \"Murder ballads\" in \"Song of Joy\":\n\r\n\"\r\nQuotes John Milton on the walls in the victim's blood.\r\nPolice are investigating at tremendous cost.\r\nIn my house he wrote 'His red right hand' \"\r\nThat I am told, is from 'Paradise Lost'\r\n\"\n\r\nMilton wrote:\r\n\"\r\nChained on the burning lake? That sure was worse.\r\nWhat if the breath that kindled those grim fires,\r\nAwaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,\r\nAnd plunge us in the flames; or from above\r\nShould intermitted vengeance arm again\r\nHis red right hand to plague us? What if all\r\nHer stores were opened, and this firmament\r\nOf Hell should spout her cataracts of fire,\r\nImpendent horrors, threatening hideous fall \r\n\"\n\r\nYou can see the obvious allure for our pal Nick.  All that old trestament wrathful divinity that fills much of his poetry.\n\r\nThe beauty of art is it's ability to become what the viewer sees or even wishes to see.  For my money, though, the tall, handsome man in this song might be the brutal God of the Christian tales, indiffrent to man's sense of self-destruction.\n\r\nCave is one fo my favourite poets who happens to be an excellent musician.\n\r\n-phase\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI always wondered if Nick Cave is a Stephwn King fan, because this song is a perfect description of Randall Flagg in The Stand.

I think they are talking about a government man. A shady unknown man that has done bad things involved with the government, such as war, illegal testing, corruption, and such. they are talking about uncle sam / the government. / the unknown and faceless government agent.\n\r\nhe will comfort you, that can represent the way they may give you a job and say you are protecting people, and it is in the interest of the nation, while in reality you are doing shady things. stacks of green paper in his red right hand, well that's obvious, the government has money to spend, and they have power and are corrupt.\n\r\nthis song was used in the x files tv series. In the show, they show shady government figures, like the cigarette smoking man, skinner, and others, that are involved with corrupt plots and cover ups. Some of them are murderers, aka \"red right hand\" (in my opinion, I think that is what the show and song is driving at)\n\r\n\"black coat\" = government agent\n\r\nmy opinion is that it has nothing to do with the devil, that's just my opinion.\n\r\nthere are lots of different opinions about this song, but this is what came into my mind when I heard it. great song by the way. (I like the music, not the lyrics)\n\r\n\"you are one microscopic cog in his plan\" = one small agent, amidst a vast network,, a large machine., one cog in a big machine.\n\r\n\"take me to the town, and go across the tracks.... \" = see? its anytown usa, it can happen anywhere. They can find you, any place, any where... no secret is safe.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nBentol's on to something -- between the Paradise Lost and the trinity references, God is a good call. One of my two favourite theories for this song.\n\r\nGoing with the god-theory: Rather than actual god, I think ol' Nick's describing the -idea- of god, drawn from the prayers of the wretched of a modern capitalist society. Divinity is meaningless, mercy and salvation are meaningless. All that matters is what you can get out of it, and so it doesn't matter who you're talking to (the 'ghost, god, man, guru' -bit). This is also why the description is so horriffic -- this is God as a dealer, the kind of guy who treats his congregation as customers. Pay your dues (in faith) and you'll get your fix of good stuff, don't and your life will be hell because always you'll be haunted by what you may ahve missed.\n\r\nMy problem with that theory is that it leaves the first verse (all that modern industrialist imagery) completely hanging. That's why I'd suggest a second identity for the man with the hand. On the one hand, it's the vindictive dealer image of God that runs through American politics. On the other, it's secular government as a controlling, identity-stealing and individualism-crushing force. That's what the lyric seems to be saying to me: \"Big Brother is watching, he knows all about you, he's everywhere, and this is -his- world. Conform to what we want you to want, or be ground down.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nScary eh? Thats neat. When I read the lyrics my first idea was a description of satan or a satanic figure, but when i actually listen to the song i get no such images of anything scare or demonic like that. Rather i get a picture of a person the kind who's status as hero or criminal is widely debated. Someone to be deeply respected and yet wanted dead by others. Someone with a shady background and the capability to be your worst nightmare or your best friend and asset. Meh.. just the imagery i get.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\ni think john andrew philot is more or less right except that his explanation is about as cryptic as the song.\r\nthe man with the red right hand is a broad metaphor for something/someone which can make you feel better but not actually make you better. perhaps something which tricks your body or your mind into feeling more at ease, drugs for example or perhaps a fashion label. things you have been convinced to like by other people and those people (the ones with the red right hands) make \"stacks of green paper\" out of your addiction.\n\r\ni really hope thats true about this whole song being adlibbed but i doubt it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nWhat if the breath that kindled those grim fires,\r\nAwaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,\r\nAnd plunge us in the flames; or from above\r\nShould intermitted vengeance arm again\r\nHis red right hand to plague us?\n\nen.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost/\u2026\n\r\nAccording to Wikipedia the action of books I-II amongst other things centres around \"a debate [between the rebels] on what to do next in relation to the war in Heaven.\"  The extract is spoken by Belial, who has been symbolic of many differing qualities throughout history.  However, in Book I of Paradise Lost he is represented as:\n\r\nBelial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd\r\nFell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\r\nVice for itself. To him no temple stood\r\nOr altar smoked; yet who more oft than he\r\nIn temples and at altars, when the priest\r\nTurns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled\r\nWith lust and violence the house of God?\r\nIn courts and palaces he also reigns,\r\nAnd in luxurious cities, where the noise\r\nOf riot ascends above their loftiest towers,\r\nAnd injury and outrage; and, when night\r\nDarkens the streets, then wander forth the sons\r\nOf Belial, flown with insolence and wine.\r\nWitness the streets of Sodom, and that night\r\nIn Gibeah, when the hospitable door\r\nExposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.\n\nen.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost/\u2026\n\r\nOn th' other side up rose\r\nBelial, in act more graceful and humane.\r\nA fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed\r\nFor dignity composed, and high exploit.\r\nBut all was false and hollow; though his tongue\r\nDropped manna, and could make the worse appear\r\nThe better reason, to perplex and dash\r\nMaturest counsels: for his thoughts were low\u00e2\u0080\u0094\r\nTo vice industrious, but to nobler deeds\r\nTimorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear,\r\nAnd with persuasive accent thus began:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nen.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost/\u2026\n\r\nSo Belial in the extract that Nick cave refers to in his song Red Right Hand is attempting to persuade atan that the rebellion against God and the war in heaven is lost and to give up the fight.  It is interesting to note that the phrase \"Red Right Hand\" refers to God and the fear of God's retaliation and not Satan or a lesser demon of hell, which isn't suprising since in religous terms right hand path denotes judeo-christian beliefs and left hand path alternative/satanist views.\n\r\nNow how does Nick cave use the phrase \"Red Right Hand\" in his song and what is he implying?\n\r\nFirstly, you have to decide weather the figure represents Christianity or the Devil.  The song is quite ambigous and could be interpreted either way.\n\r\nsavage suggested this song was about an evangelist and these lines certainly support that argument:\n\r\nHe'll wrap you in his arms,\r\ntell you that you've been a good boy\r\nHe'll rekindle all the dreams\n\r\nas Awwsugar pointed out these lines reflect the paradoxical nature of the trinity of god:\n\r\nHe's a god, he's a man,\r\nhe's a ghost, he's a guru\n\r\nCould it be that the Guru along with the Evangelical aspects of the song is Nick's suspected form of the second coming of Christ?\n\r\nAnyway I've spent enough time beating around the bush, I agree with the whole idea of Red Right Hand being a retelling of Faust but would add that the figure in the song is distinctly Christian and possibly a manifestation of God. \n\r\nI juat wanted to end by saying that the interpretations that you guys offer are really fascinating and to keep up the good work.  However, I doubt Nick Cave reads Stephen King.  He tends to \r\nlike the deeper, philosophical artists not the paperback novellists but you never know....\n\r\nI doubt that this song was entirely ad-libbed, or even partly ad-libbed.  it was probably well-thought out and written well before recording.\n\r\nAlso, ever noticed how Nick cave likes his serial killers, murderers and anti-heroes to be handsome and sexually alluring?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nI've read through all of these and have only found one member (John Andrew Philpot) who makes mention of what i think is a well crafted metaphore for drugs and addiction.\n\r\nTake the verse\r\nHere he comes..\r\nThrough the ghettos and the barrio\r\nand the bowery and the slum\r\nA shadow is cast wherever he stands\r\nStacks of green paper in his\r\nred right hand\n\n\r\nThis, to me anyway, points to nothing other than drugs. Coming in through the poorer sections of a city and leaving it's shadow cast on every where it's presence is known. Then, of course, the stacks of money piling up in it's red right hand.\n\r\nAlso, the last verse in the song can explain to anyone who's dealt the addiction (and maybe hasn't) the extent that it can overwhelm every \n\r\nIt's debatable, i know - but Nick's own struggles with addiction put this meaning over the top for me. Also, suggesting that the song is taken at face value as being about some evil, possibly supernatural devil-like figure belies the masterful song writer that is Nick Cave. Would he simply write some scary little tune about a Randal Flagg type persona? i don't believe it's in his character - particularly not on an album that isn't, say \"Murder Ballads.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nRandall Flagg, from the Stephen King Book  mini series, THE STAND, is the person mentioned in this song.

God/Ghost/Man is obviously the Trinity, with guru referring specifically to Jesus' time on Earth, when he had his devoted followers. But that is hardly the beginning.\n\r\nThe end of the first stanza talks about God coming from a gathering storm (end of the world?) The second stanza starts with telling you that \"you've been a good boy\" = forgiveness of sins.  Rekindling of dreams = restoration of faith. Even through all this, he has the hidden Red Right Hand - that is, even though we as Christians see God as loving, there is the vengeful aspect, the Old Testament God, and the one that will return during the end times.\n\r\nThe third stanza talks about how God provides to the poor; how He gives to those who have nothing, and coming through the barrio/ghetto/etc. - those are all places where the poor reside.  \n\r\nThe fourth, and final, stanza is more about Revelations. Seeing God in our nightmares and dreams talks about the rewards of Heaven (\"you'll see him in your dreams\") and punishment of Hell (\"...nightmares\"). Him not appearing to be what he seems means people's rejection of God; people not believing in Him, and so they won't recognize that it is God. \n\r\nAnd the last four lines?  Microscopic cog in catastrophic plan = playing a small part in the overall plan (the endgame being from Revelations.) And we've been all designed by God, and directed by our free will.\n\n\n\n", "comment_52": "\n2 words\n\r\nCorruption and Opression.\n\r\nI'm loving what I'm hearing here. Every person has taken their own meaning from this song. As a song writer myself, I approach a song like some painters approach a canvass, sometimes planned out, sometimes just free sketching but mostly both. \n\r\nIn my humble opinion Nick Cave has this one pretty well laid out, borrowing from biblical images. Leonard Cohen is also a master of this technique. I think that corruption and oppression are the main themes here. One Microscopic Cog in His Catastrophic Plan feels biblical but it applies to any senerio dealing with corruption and oppression. Corruption in Capitalism, Socialism, Communism... It does not make much difference... A good songwriter leaves that up to his listener almost never forcing his/her own personal situation.\n\r\nAs for the allusions to Stephen King and so forth, it is quite possible that he and Nick Cave are borrowing from the same well- the poets and philosiphers of the past.\n\r\nOne more thing, the music is brilliant in this...

The line \"microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan\" heavily suggests that his overall goal is something chaotic and evil-like doomsday- and \"red right hand\" could be taken in a literal sense, seeing as the devil is generally personified as a red guy with horns. \n\nTL;DR: The guy the song is describing is an anarchist masquerading as your friend.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_68": "\nHe could also be a Darren O Shaughnessy fan, as this song was used in the movie version of three of his Cirque du Freak books \"The Vampire's Assistant\".
