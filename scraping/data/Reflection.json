{"comment_0": "\nThis is a really incredible Tool song ! I was fortunate enough to see it performed live. It's a really beautiful and opitmistic song. This song has a commom message among Tool songs: pushing limits and excuse the term, \"maximizing human potential\". An incredible line is that we are \"capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable.\" I find that to be true but there are obstacles in the way. And in the beginning of the song, Maynard sounds as if he's just about to give up. Instead of \"pushing the envelope\",  he's happy with a self-indulgent, pitiful existence. This song has a lot of similarities to Lateralus. Although Maynard never gives you the exact details, \"there is so much more that beckons us\" and if we can't figure that out, then we can \"find peace within the emptiness\".\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nSorry. I forgot to mention that I suggest listening to this song whenever you feel like shit about whatever your into or if you are just feeling overwhelming hopeless. I hope that this song helps you out in the same way it has helped me\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis is my favorite Tool song.  Anyone who says it has no mystical meaning or intention has not plunged into the depths of meditation.  The Buddha himself would be proud of this song, as it reflects the dharma of Buddhism and Hinduism.  The entire album is about transcendence and this is the climax:  Enlightenment\r\nI have come curiously close to the end, down\r\nBeneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole,\r\nDefeated, I concede and\r\nMove closer\r\nI may find comfort here\r\nI may find peace within the emptiness\r\nHow pitiful.  \u00e2\u0080\u00a6it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calling me.\r\nThis is the dark night of the soul.  A deep depression every spiritual seeker goes through.  Eventually we all get to this point where the suffering is so tremendous we start looking for a way to end it.  It is like the divine is calling you to find it.\r\nAnd in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping\r\nThe moon tells me a secret - my confidant\r\nAs full and bright as I am\r\nThis light is not my own and\r\nA million light reflections pass over me\r\nThe moon is a common theme for spiritual teachers.  The dharma is just a finger pointing to the moon.  You grasp at the finger (the teacher or teaching), when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as simple as looking at the moon (absolute reality).  In these lyrics, there is an understanding in the subject that the moon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light is not its own, it is only an illusion; Maya.\r\nIts source is bright and endless\r\nShe resuscitates the hopeless\r\nWithout her, we are lifeless satellites drifting\r\nObviously, the source of light is the sun.  In the allegory of the cave, Socrates uses the Sun to represent pure goodness which is in all of us. It is our divine nature.  We are all that.  We just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know it.  The ascent up causes a disorienting blur of the senses and eventually your union with permanent bliss.  If we can remember this, we will never suffer again.\n\r\nAnd as I pull my head out I am without one doubt\r\nDon't wanna be down here feeding my narcissism.\r\nI must crucify the ego before it's far too late\r\nI pray the light lifts me out\r\nBefore I pine away.\r\nTo attain the selfless state, one must kill the ego.  The Buddha taught this constantly, using the word atman which can be used to mean transcendent Self or ego self.  The ego is the illusion of who you think you are.  Enlightenment is the complete destruction of this view.  The light of the transcendent self will lift you out.  Only you can help you.\r\nSo crucify the ego, before it's far too late\r\nTo leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical,\r\nAnd you will come to find that we are all one mind\r\nCapable of all that's imagined and all conceivable.\r\nJust let the light touch you\r\nAnd let the words spill through\r\nAnd let them pass right through\r\nBringing out our hope and reason ...\r\nbefore we pine away.\r\nThe best lines of the song, the subject realizes truth and the endless possibilities of life.  We are all literally one mind capable of all that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagined and conceivable.  Now he is free and genuinely qualifies as a human being pouring out love and compassion into the world.  He is telling you to let this love (light from the sun) pour and spill through you before you pine away, endlessly longing for something better.\n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThe first time I ever really listened to this song was when I was in Washington state, on the beach at night and the moon was absolutely full and perfect. The light from the moon was reflection off of the ocean and this song was playing and it just gave me goosebumps. I was coming out of a very shitty relationship and felt very lost. This song on that night really pulled me through, and it's something I will never forget. So no, I don't have an analysis of what the song may truly mean, but I know exactly what it means to me, and I think in some way that is the point of any song, to find out what I means personally to you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI think that the ego is often outdated for the common person in day to day life in this modern society.\r\nWe are born with the ego for survival, but in todays society, physical survival is quite simple, and the ego often gets in the way. I believe this song implies that to advance, to further develop and evolve, we must crucify the ego.\r\nImagine someone who lets their ego get he best of them, then imagine an incident involving that person if they simply put away with their ego, and it is easy to see how the song is significant.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nThis song is about slowly drifting into depression because it feels more comfortable than facing your fears and risking failure when you don't have much to offer.  As he starts slipping, the guy rationalizes that the reason he can't be happy is that he is better than everyone else--that he's above them, so he's much better off alone in his own pitiful hole.\n\r\nAs he's tripping on his self-pity, he's made aware that the moon(his confidant), the brightest, fullest body in the night sky, is simply reflecting the light of other bodies.  Even though the moon provides light to everyone, she has no light of her own.  At that moment, the guy realizes that he doesn't need anything great built-in to himself in order to be full and bright, he just needs to reflect the light of others.  As he lifts himself out of his hole, he immediately realizes that the comfort he felt from his seclusion and loneliness was far worse than the relief he feels out in the open.  Even though it feels comforting to be depressed and accepting of your own sad fate, the relief that you get from rejecting it and rising above it feels much better.\n\r\nThe key here is that the moon was reflecting light, not absorbing it.  Even though she was better off than the guy in the song, she took notice and projected her (borrowed)light to get him out of his hole.  The rest of the song is about living by others for others.  You can't produce anything within yourself to make yourself happy, so you have to share the happiness of others.  You have to crucify your ego and make an effort to reflect light onto others.  The message is basically to follow the Golden Rule.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nSimply on a personal note, I first listenedn any drugs.  And I don't claim they are the \"key\" to understanding the song, or even that it has any relation to this before I'd ever take to drugs whatsoever.  However, I thought I understood it, more or less, but really didn't exactly connect with it.  After my first encounter with psychedelic mushrooms, I listened to it again and it was like I'd literally transformed my interpretation of this song.  Again, I know it probably isn't the same for everybody, but on a personal level I do feel I understand the song a lot better than ever before.\n\r\nMy Interpretation:\r\nI see a man who has come to realize he's disgusted with the person he's become.  He fears it's too late to turn away, he's gone too far, and perhaps he should simply embrace it (the ego, or \"self-indulgent pitiful hole\").  Then, in the pit of his disgrace, he has an epiphany.  The moon, as \"full and bright\" as it is, cannot and does not rely on its own self to be at its \"maximum,\" as it were.  It seeks the light from the \"sun,\" an endless source of energy and life (for this planet, at least).  Just like it, the man should seek guidance, recognize his own imperfections, and accept help from a \"higher order\" (be it reason, religion, spirituality, anything), in order to be truly whole or happy, or reach a sort of enlightenment.  But when you just accept yourself as you are, you're no better than the moon without the sun, just a \"lifeless satellite\"\n\r\nThe man understands, he wants to change what he's become, he doesn't need to sit and simply suffer his 'narcissistic' existence anymore - he wants to be alive.  Now that he truly believes he can be saved from himself, he turns to the audience and gives his sort of testimony and call to action.  He cries out that we join him in a search for truth, to cast our our pitiful judgements of one another, to want something more than simply what we've come to understand in this world.  It's not some contract, X number of years on earth for some heaven after death; rather, it's a promise for a happy life in the now.  This world offers so much more than many have witnessed, and he begs we not spare ourselves its beauty and a chance to see beyond our ego.  Our lives are a journey and there's only so many steps we can take before \"we pine away,\" so don't take it for granted.\n\r\nI don't claim any superior knowledge over anyone who has or hasn't taken any drugs, meditated, gone through life changing experiences, nor is it my intention to give off that tone.  That's what I hear when I listen to this song, and I'm sure I'm not alone. :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nThis is sort of a long analysis, and without an understanding of the concept of the entire Lateralus album, it doesn't make as much sense, but I'll try my best:\n\r\nFirst of all, there's a reason it fits so well with Disposition and Triad. They all tell the same story. Disposition is sort of the beginning of the mind or the soul (I guess you could say the childhood), where you don't have as much experience or knowledge about the world, and you go entirely off of what you're taught. Your knowledge of the world depends on your *disposition* to it, and as such what people \"mention [...] to [you]\" causes the \"weather [to] change\". Reflection, then, is sort of the maturing of the soul, the adulthood if you will, where you begin to *reflect* on your experience. Triad, although being purely instrumental, closes off the trilogy well. I'll likely explain that on Triad's respective page.\n\r\nNow for a bit of a part-by-part analysis of Reflection:\n\r\n\"I have come curiously close to the end, down\r\nBeneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole, defeated I\r\nConcede and (Concede and) move closer (Move closer), I may find comfort here\r\nI may find peace within the emptiness, how pitiful\n\r\nIt's calling me (Calling me)\r\netc...\"\n\r\nThe narrator lives in a self-indulgent, selfish lifestyle. He focuses his life on his own benefit, not on his moral or spiritual gain. He considers it a pitiful lifestyle, but he refuses to do anything about it, instead feeling defeated by it, and tries to find his happiness in what he has, rather than doing something to create his happiness by improving his life.\n\r\n\"And in my darkest moment, fetal and weepin'\r\nThe moon tells me a secret, my confidant\r\nAs full and bright as I am, this light is not my own and\r\nA million light reflections pass over me\"\n\r\nAs the narrator is slipping down this path and losing himself, the moon (a common symbol of the spirit or spirituality) shares with him the secret of a proper life. It being \"full and bright\" means that it is pure and whole. And the reflections symbolise the knowledge and the awakening which he is receiving.\n\r\n\"It's source is bright and endless, she resuscitates the hopeless\r\nWithout her we are lifeless satellites dreamin' dreams\r\nAnd as I pull my head out, I am without one doubt, don't want to be down here soothing my narcissism, I\r\nMust crucify the ego before it's far too late, I pray the light lifts me out\n\r\nBefore I pine away\r\netc.\"\n\r\nThe moon is full of wisdom because it is truly complete and never-ending. It gives him hope and allows him to change, something he thought himself incapable of her, and now he believes himself indebted to her. And when he starts to truly see things, or \"pull his head out\" of his pitiful state, he realises that he no longer wants to be a part of such a selfish world, and wants to be a part of something bigger, which requires him to rid himself of his ego (often also referred to as the self) to become a part of something bigger, before it's far too late to change.\n\r\n\"So crucify the ego before it's far too late to leave behind this place, so negative and blind and cynical\r\nAnd you will come to find that we are all one mind, capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable\r\nJust let the light touch you and let the words spill through, just let them pass right through, bringin' out our hope and reason\n\r\nBefore we pine away\r\netc.\"\n\r\nAnd now he shares his realisation with the listener. He realises that we all must rid ourselves of our no-longer-necessary egos to become a part of something truly great, where all people are one. We are all the same person in different bodies. And if we see ourselves as that and unite, we're capable of everything, but rather because we remain selfish and refuse to listen to reason, we remain negative and blind and achieve very little. So he says that we must all accept this (\"let the light touch you\") and then share it with others to get them to see (\"let the words spill though, just let them pass right through\") until we can awaken the whole world to the true hope in the world, before we all destroy ourselves.\n\n\r\nThis song very much draws on the concepts explained in Lateralus, Parabol/Parabola, and to some extent, Schism, The Patient, and The Grudge. I'd suggest looking into the whole album.\n\r\nAlso, has anyone noticed that the intro to this song (when split into sections based on the introduction of instruments) is nearly the same when you play it backwards? I haven't yet found any meaning to this, other than the connection to the title.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nI duuno what HE meant by it but it kinda seems to me that he's saying if you're all wrapped up in self-pity and sadness, mabe it's time to just contemplate your position in the entirety of the human condition and just be glad to just BE.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nThis song is about becoming part of a higher consciousness in any form.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\ni think this song is about instead of pulling away from saddness and instead of fighting depression, just leting it all go and fall as deep as one can and by going through the saddness u reach the emptiness where there are nothing that controls u, u are finally totally free to make up your own world, becoming part of a higher consciousness, giving away all temptations, crucifyig the ego. reaching the satate of parabol/parabola. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nFor me, Tool's contant message throughout both this album, and Aenima, our need to evolve and realize our full potenial as beings of conscious thought.

Eventually, after pining away for a while, he realized that the image he saw in the pool was a reflection of himself.

I believe it's actually about being praised for one's talents and succumbing to one's inevitably growing ego. Coming \"curiously close to the edge\" is coming close to succumbing to it (the praise) and living in a \"self indulgent hole\" (fueled by the praise). Then in an epiphany (moon's secret), he realized, although he is a bright and shining light, the light is not his own. He (or the character sung about)didn't do anything but follow in the footsteps of others. If one would want to look at it from Maynard's point of view, yes he's a talented singer with deep, thought provoking lyrics, but he wasn't a sole creator so to speak. He understood that he stood on others shoulders to get where he was; creators of music, the electronic equipment used, media attention. This is what is meant when he says \"we are all one mind\". It's not mystical or anything. It just means that we build off one another. Nobody created anything without the help of previous creators. So you should crucify your ego because you haven't done anything others haven't helped you with. It's pretty deep and one of there best songs if you ask me. Of course, if you have created something completely new and inventive then yea, you have every right to be an arrogant prick.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_20": "\nEveryone says that interpretations of Tool linked with LSD and other drugs like that are just assuming that Tool are obsessed with the stuff, but hear me out here. \n\r\nIt seems to be a bad acid trip, which induces ego death in the guy tripping.

In the peak, it is pure hell, hence \"curiously close to the end\". He can feel his destruction coming. He is trying to act curious about it, trying to make sense of it all, but he is breaking down. He attempts to embrace it (\"Concede, and move closer\") but thats not working. It's destroying the light inside him, taking it away. He somehow barely understands that the flawed experience is probably part of him, old experiences which cause him pain, that he may have been trying to escape.\n\r\n\"And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping \r\nThe moon tells me a secret, my confidant \r\nAs full and bright as I am, this light is not my own and \r\nA million light reflections pass over me \"\n\r\nHere the moon seems to be actually talking to him (probably to do with the fact he is tripping balls) and those last two lines are what the moon says. A confidant is someone you trust and aspire to, and in that context it makes sense. He is told that even though the overwhelming fear he feels seems like it is ripping his light away, he is like the moon, all illumination from another origin. His soul and thoughts are not really his own, just part of a universal consciousness, and he uses this to remind himself that the fear cannot harm him.\n\r\n\"It's source is bright and endless, she resuscitates the hopeless \r\nWithout her we are lifeless satellites dreamin' dreams\"\n\r\nThis source is the universal consciousness I just mentioned. I get this idea from a Bill Hicks quote which is actually quoted in 'Third Eye'; \r\n\"Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There's no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.\" \r\nThe man has this realization and this singular consciousness becomes his source of hope in this terrifying state. With concepts taking place in mind, his state begins to change.\n\r\n\"And as I pull my head out, I am without one doubt, don't want to be down here soothing my narcissism\"\n\r\nHe begins to touch base with the new reality he has conceived. He wants to come back to the sane world, he wants to live a  new life, he wants to leave the troubles he obsessed over behind. \n\r\n\"I must crucify the ego before it's far too late, I pray the light lifts me out\"\n\r\nHe realizes he can do this in his state, and that he needs to do it right there and then, or he may never make it out of this hellish state. He needs to confront and battle these demons or they will never leave him alone. He prays he will win and resurface from hell after...\n\r\n\"Before I pine away \r\nBefore I pine away\r\nBefore I pine away\r\nBefore I pine away\"\n\r\nHe feels the fear that he may actually never get to see this new life. He might become a vegetable, and end up thinking he's a sunflower or something...\n\r\n\"So crucify the ego before it's far too late to leave behind this place, so negative and blind and cynical\"\n\r\nA simpler version of what I've said before. He needs to kill the part of him which worries so much over the superficial parts of life which made him \"negative and blind and cynical\", to accept the past and move on and out, because that is the only way to escape this state of mind which is essentially his old life and state of mind collapsing down onto him.\n\r\n\"And you will come to find that we are all one mind, capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable\"\n\r\nAlmost a recital of that Bill Hicks quote, he is reminding himself that in truth he cannot be harmed, he can move on and will make it out.\n\r\n\"Just let the light touch you and let the words spill through, just let them pass right through, bringing out our hope and reason\"\n\r\nHe is using the belief of one consciousness to draw himself out, and drawing from it to help give him the strength, to endure, and to wake up.\n\r\n\"Before I pine away \r\nBefore I pine away\r\nBefore I pine away\r\nBefore I pine away\"\n\r\nThe trip seems to fade. It seems unresolved how it ends, whether he made it out to appreciate his life like he hoped, or whether his past state of mind crushed his thoughts and he lost his incarnation of consciousness, or if he was absorbed into the singular mind, waking up from the dream leaving a shell behind.

We think we have this knowledge when in fact, the information we have is pure.

I thought about the Freudian concept of the term. \n\r\nSigmund Freud, a psychoanalyst, divided the mind in to 3 parts: The id, the ego, and the superego. The id is the part of the mind that demands satisfaction, no matter the consequence or situation (ex. a thirsty infant). The superego is the part that upholds your morals (ex.  your conscience and ideals). The ego is what realizes that immediate gratification isn't possible, and suppresses urges until they can be sated (ex. going to the refrigerator when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hungry).\n\r\nIt seems to make sense because he called his \u00e2\u0080\u0098self-indulgent hole\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pitiful. Which may mean that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become disgusted with his excessive indulgence. But then I thought that if you destroy your ego you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably indulge more. \n\r\nThe lyrics say that the end is \u00e2\u0080\u0098beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole\u00e2\u0080\u009d. If you wanted to convey the transcendence of indulgence, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably say that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe end\u00e2\u0080\u009d was above the hole.   But Maynard uses the word below.\n\r\nWith this in mind, I read that the ego is ruled by the \u00e2\u0080\u0098reality principle\u00e2\u0080\u0099. If you think that your urge is impossible to satisfy at the moment, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll focus on it until it is. (ex. when you really have to take a piss). But if you realize that you are \u00e2\u0080\u0098capable\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of gratifying your self and you let the desire \u00e2\u0080\u0098pass right through\u00e2\u0080\u0099, you wont waste your time \u00e2\u0080\u0098pining\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for gratification. Instead, you have it. And in being free of this strong internal desire, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have more reason because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re free from this one negative impulse. \n\r\nUnfortunately, we have a lot more than just one desire. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taught that gratification is a dirty thing and that the only way to be pure is to deny our impulses. To me, the song means that people, being caught up in reality and their desires, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize their true potential. To reach some ultimate truth, you need to rid yourself of desires. And the only way to do that, is to act on them.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_61": "\nThat's a great theory ilikepork.

Although i do see your point, i find it really hard to believe that tool would take a classical greek myth and re-work it into a song. Most of Maynards lyrics and drowning in allusions to obscure beliefs, knowledge and literature. I believe that these references aren't the actual meaning of the song, but a device used to help convey Tool's own unique message. In other words, any parallels between Reflection and the story of narcissus don't exist because the song is a retelling of the story of narcissus, but because the story relates to Tool's own message, and can be used as an aid in conveying it. Well, that's my opinion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_69": "\nI have a question regarding all tool of tool's songs, could you consider them literature like you would a novel or a poem?

Instead of dwelling on the depression that you feel, you accept it and know that there is much more out there in the world other than your conscious state of mind; hence \"crucify the ego.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_74": "\nI was reading something further up about this song being about relationships or sex, and how enlightened that viewpoint is. To me, sex and relationships are ALL about the ego- and this isn't good or bad, it just IS. In a sexual relationship, all we are looking for is someone who reflects are own ego back to us. This is really narcissicm, if you think about it. It's normal, but I think there is more to this song than just romance.\n\r\nBeing an Aquarius, I for one would be so disappointed if all these songs were about sexual relationships. We are all one, there is so much more. True enlightenment is loving all of humanity, even the homeless guy on the street who can't affort Tool tickets.\n\r\n The idea of posessing and being possesed by someone, or saving or being saved by someone, or being \"special\" in the eyes of your \"precious\"  is not enlightenment, in my opinion. Yes, there can be love between 2 people, (I'm happily married) but our society is so sick when in comes to this kind of love- people cling to each other so desparately like there will never be enough love, and if they don't get it from their partner, how quickly it turns to hate! \n\r\nTalking about sex or romance turns all this beautiful music into just another porn movie  chick flick- take your pick. They are about the same in the end.  I hope there is a transcendent love present when large numbers of people get together for a tool concert. If Maynard were just writing about just his girlfriend, it would be so fucking banal and anticlimactic, after all that talk about us all being one and capable of anything. How can one even listen to a typical love song after hearing this stuff? It's like peering into the beyond, and then you have to go about an ordinary existence- Love songs are about the narcissistic need to breed and become immortal, in the end.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_75": "\nthis is the most positive song tool has ever made! there were lines that were hopeful let's say... but the anger, disappointment, etc. always came out somewhere in the lyrics... but this one is really pure... \n\r\ntool is my favorite band for years. but i also think that it is time to take conscious breaths, let this rage go and concentrate on more enlightened lyrics. \n\r\ni hope \"lateralis\" was just a milestone on this way...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_76": "\nLateralUs\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_77": "\nAnother one of my favorite songs.\n\r\nI have come curiously close to the end...

Even though I have all these neat things I'm just not happy. But something is telling me to give it all away. I concede, I give up all my worldly possesions. I may find peace withing the 'emptyness.' It's calling me. It's undenyable. Within my darkest moment.... The moon/the light tells me a secret... As full and bright as I am... All the things I have, it's not mine. The light/the source has given me everything. My looks/money/material things. But 'without her' we are no more significant than a rock. And as I pull my head out... Don't wanna be down here serving my narcissim. I don't want the material world. Crucify the ego. Life is about loving each other, etc.... True joy is what we can't buy.

This is my subjective view.  When it says, \"in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping, the moon tells me a secret, my confident\", I kind of relate this to my own natal moon placement (that being in the twelveth house).  Because it's the emotions sort of hidden in the unconscious, and when I am depressed that is where I go, and that is where I find my solace, when my imagination is tapped by my loneliness and melancholy, and I can explore anything there.  And then the next two lines are informing that these thoughts-these messages that end up coming through the imagination, communicating to you, and then through you, once expressed, don't actually come from you, but you're merely the mediator, and there is something much greater.  I think that's really beautifully put there.\n\r\nAnd, as a wannabe-writer, I love this line: \"Just let the light touch you and let the words spill through\" and so on...it's really all a beautiful explanation of this great heirarchy of creativity.\n\r\nI just love this song and relate to it so much, because of my natural tendency towards melancholy, and the peace I find in it (comfortable sadness...could consume you so easily).  Ironically of course, the song helps me be melancholy.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_79": "\n\" by myusernameisthis on 03-07-2005 @ 01:17:17 PM\r\nLateralUs \"\n\r\nHoly shit!!

That is like human's, we are given hundreds of oportunities to live to our best (eg. being born) but most waste them and let them fly past. Like the moon, it's light source is the sun, and yet this beautiful thing's power is wasted in the earea that it shines around the mood. Human's strength is given to us by some other power through our parents (Maynard is a strong believer of spiritualism and so this is relevent) but the amount of it that is blown away by the lazy humans is staggering.

When I least expect it I placed \"Lateralus\" into my cd player and turned to this song as it's my favorite from this album. It came upon the last verse which has always been my personally most enjoyed part of the song and I sang through it and pretty much stopped dead in my tracks when I remembered something. A couple months ago I sat back and watched the \"Amotion\" DVD with commentaries on the videos. I can't remember exactly which video it was but I had the Maynard commentary on and he was speaking about an original translation of a ...hebrew term? Jehovah may have been the term (I'm not what one would call religous so bare with me here.) Anyhow, he was explaining how the original translation for the term meant \"Light\". Through random modern translations it took the image of a man with a beard, etc. etc. In it's original term it had meant light though, and in that term it had actually meant love. The light which is love itself as it is the single greatest part that seperates us from any other species. You know, once you go farther and farther and continue deeper into the thoughts which bind us to this mortality you sort of stray away from that idea. Such as in philosophy, after you go too far you can't really come back from there. It makes the go viable and it continues to grow and you forfeit your intuition for the ability to know. After you know so much though you start to disdain ideas such as emotional qualities like love. Trying to define it in restraints of physical attraction and mental compatability......... It's sort of in a way when he describes \"I may find peace within the emptiness. How pitiful.\" Trying to find the holes and fill them with the simple complacency you can find with that standard human running in the lines of \"physical attraction and mental compatability\". And that it's pitiful to fill your life with this and live it that way. That the true concept of \"Love\" is the greatest thing imaginable.\n\r\nThis song, is about learning to love. Not to abide by the standards you find through the depths of human breaches.

This song, this whole album, is a journey into the deepest, darkest, and most lightened parts of the human soul. It is greatly influenced by buddhism and other esoteric themes. This song in particular is basically enlightenment put into words, if it were even possible to do so. The lyrics speak to me. I can feel them and understand them. Buddhism(mahayana specifically) tells you that you must release the ego(your image of your self, what you believe to be your self). You must eliminate all desire, as this the cause of suffering, and be content with the possibilities of existance. All emotions are created by you, they arise by your doings and your reactions.

For those not in the know Jesus preached during his life (or time on earth if you will) about loving thy neighbor.) and you'll become somethign else.

It bears a strong resemblance to the myth of Narcissus (from which the psychological condition narcissism got it's name) Who was so beautiful that everyone who saw him instantly fell in love with him. He however did not like this, because he didn't think anyone were worthy of his love since nobody were as beautiful as him. For this the gods cursed him to fall in love with his own reflection in the water. He could never embrace his own reflection and it was always out of reach. He spent the rest of his days on the bank watching his reflection until he pined away into a flower. \n\r\nI dunno, just seems logical when you look at the lyrics which speaks of a reflection, narcissism, crucifying the ego and pining away.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_122": "\nThis song makes me imagine a dark brown forest, with a lot of people crowding around a person resembling Maynard with a beam of tremendously bright but focused light projecting from his body, arcing over the top of the trees, and into the starry night sky.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_123": "\nThe first part of this song is easy to understand. I think its about depression. Everyone goes through it and feels like they have to crawl in a hole so they can escape their problems. The problem with depression is that it can keep getting worst. You move farther and farther in this \"hole\" and after a while you get used to it. You make peace within the emptiness, and you feel pitiful about it. So when maynard is saying \"Its calling me\", I believe depression is whats calling him, deeper and deeper in this hole. This makes more sense to me since when he says \"Its calling me\", you hear an echo, as if you were in a deep hole.\n\r\nWhile your in depression, as it gets worst and worst, you experience your darkest moment; when things are the worst. You decide you cant take this anymore, you have to do something about it. Some people think suicide is the best solution, but really you just need someone to talk to about your troubles. In the song he is talking to the moon, which makes since because when people are sad or lonely they usually look up at the moon or stars. And the moon is telling him, \"As full and bright as I am, this light is not my own and a million lights reflections pass over me\". What the moon is saying is that as full and bright as I seem, this light is not my own; the sun gives the moon its light. And the million lights that pass over him I assume, are the stars; gives the moon more appeal. What the moon is saying is that it cannot shine without the sun or stars. This relates to humans reflecting off other humans and another one of my theories that I will explain sometime later. So after he hears \"the moons secret\", he feels like he understands everything now. That he must join in with other people in order to shine, or be happy, or succeed, etc. \n\r\nThis next part is really confusing. The best idea I can come up with is when he says \"she\" and \"her\", he is refering to this secret:\n\r\nIt's source is bright and endless, she resuscitates the hopeless \r\nWithout her we are lifeless satellites dreamin' dreams\n\r\nSo with my interpretation it would read:\r\nTogether our source of what we can accomplish is bright and endless; we restore the hopeless, meaning we renew it, or reset the limits to whats possible; Without each other we are lifeless followers chasing our out of reach dreams.\n\r\nAnd so as he pulls his head out (of depression) he is without one doubt that he doesnt want to be down in the hole soothing his narcissism, that he must crucify his ego. He's not talking about a cocky ego, he's talking about a negative ego, or attitude. So he must get rid of his negative ego before its to late and he pines away. To \"pine away\" means to lose strength, health, or flesh from grief. So basically he's saying that he must break out of his depression before he gets so deep in this \"hole\" that he cant move anymore.\n\r\nAnd in the end he is saying he again that he must crucify his negative ego before its far to late, and leave behind this place (depression) its so, negative and blind and cynical (another word for negative) And we will come to find that we are all one mind, (This one line has a meaning of its own which i will explain later) By working together we are capable of all thats imaginable and all concievable. Just let the light touch you (like its touched him) and let the words spill through just let them pass right through (speak your mind) and lets bring out our hope and reason all before its to late and we pine away. \n\r\nThats about it. This song is awesome and so is the whole Lateralus CD. It all has so much meaning and symbolism, I love it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_124": "\nOk so the page before this basically told you what i thought the lyrics meant, but now I'm going to tell you what I think the name of the song means. \r\nFrom the lyrics, I got that the meaning of the song was to go out and be social and interact with other people (reflect off of each other). And thats basically where the meaning of the song comes from. People reflecting off of each other. Whether its knowlege being reflected or personality or anything and everything. Think of it this way: People are learning new stuff every day. And most of what you learn comes from people teaching it to each other. Where would we be if our parents didn't teach us anything? Another thing people reflect is personality. Your personality basically depends on your suroundings while growing up. Like how your parents raise you has alot to do with how you turn out. And what kind of friends you have and what type of school you go to. If you think about it, and get really into it, you don't have much say for how you turn out. It all depends on your surroundings. Your personality changes everyday as you go through more experiences and make mistakes. So, basically, I guess what this all means to me is that you cant really judge a person without jugding the people around him. Like in Maynards case, he had a bad childhood as we all know. And that made him the great artist he is today, so think about if he had good parents and good friends. Can you imagine Maynard working a regular job in a suit and tie like a normal person? \r\nMaynard is a deep person so I think its a possibility that he could of thought of all of this when he made this song. This is just an optimistic song and so is this CD. So like Disposition, He could just be sitting back and appreciating life and all the amazing stuff I just explained. \r\nOr on another note, he could be saying that people are not always themselves and they should be. You know how Maynards always preaching to think for yourself (like the beggining of the Salival Third Eye). So maybe he's saying you have to stop letting people influence you and do what you want to do.

It is the second movement of the epic \"resolution\"\r\nThe second to last step on the road to enlightenment is about self.

Crucify the ego and reject individualistic thinking. Embrace the collective. Become a waking part of the one organism: humanity. \r\nThis message is somewhat upsetting to many.

However, if Tool puts so much meaning into their songs, is that meaning meant to be found by analyzing them, or simply feeling them.  I've described Tool's music as an experience to others before.  I just felt the need to throw these thoughts out there.  Anyone is free to interpret the lyrics as they please, and figure out what it means to them, but basically what I am trying to say is, if there is a way to figure out what Maynard is trying to say, what is the best approach?

The truth that life is amazing, that we all share this world. Simply amazing, every facet of life. It's saying to drop those bad habits of egotism, pride, and selfishness and live.

He is beginning to put together why he hates this person and is coming up with several ideas as to why but is also feeling a need to return to hate. Therefore, he is dividing his consciousness into several peices and reprganizing them in order to find out why he does what he does and how to let go.\n\r\nThen comes \"Parabol(a)\" which is about embracing life. The first step to healing. He has chosen to finally seek a higher purpose in life. He understands that our actions leave a permanent impact in the world and that this is the time in human history that we have to make those footprints.\n\r\nThen comes \"Lateralus.\" It's about finally being awake to reality through objective veiwing of the self and seeing the self as being imperfect and that the morality of all decisions is graded on a spectrum.\n\r\nAfter that comes \"Disposition.\" Dispostion is about finally beginning anew and choosing to mature. Before there was a fear of maturity, but now he has rached the point where he can mature without sacrificing his identity.\n\r\nFinally, there is \"Reflection,\" which is about seeing beyond the self an connecting with people on a deeper level.

It is like a chain of people pulling other people up toward oneness.  Each spark of light is another person, another struggle toward oneness.\n\r\n\"It's source is bright and endless, she resuscitates the hopeless \r\nWithout her we are lifeless satellites dreamin' dreams\"\n\r\nWithout both the masculine and feminine identities, we can never achieve oneness.  The feminine gave rise and continues to give rise to seperation.  She creates or gives birth to reality - and humans give birth to more separate people.  Separation is neither good nor bad - but different than oneness.  All the separated must become the one again before it is too late.  \n\r\n\"And as I pull my head out,\"\n\r\nI'll let you figure that one out.

People that may hate you.  Your enemies.  Kill yourself to yourself so that there is room for merging with all other conciousness. \n\r\n\"Before I pine away\"\n\r\nIf the oneness operation doesn't work immediately, all of humanity will become hooked together in freakish knowing of each other.  No lies, no secrets, no differences, no escape, no rest.  It will become like torture and people will yearn for the good old days of separation.  It will take generations to fix the damage. \n\r\n\"And you will come to find that we are all one mind,\"\n\r\nHaving killed yourself on the ego level, you find that you can communicate with other people in an odd way.  Schism: \"To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication\"  The individual (ego) is a block.  When two people try to achieve oneness in the physical (like lovers) pain and roadblocks often result.  But oneness of the mind is possible.  \n\r\nSchism: \"cold, cold, cold,\r\nCold silence has\r\na tendency to \r\natrophy any\r\nsense of compassion\"\n\r\nHe is not referring to oral communication, but mental commucation - talking in your head.  Remember, some individuals are more at one in some ways than others.  They can share energy and thoughts and love and hate.  Some people can hear your thoughts (the higher) some can't (the lower).  But once you get high enough, no other communication seems good enough.  If one partner has it and the other doesn't, the relationship is doomed.\n\r\n\"capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable \r\nJust let the light touch you and let the words spill through, just let them pass right through, bringin' out our hope and reason\"\n\r\nThere are factions that want this power for themselves.  They have achieved higher levels of oneness but failed to kill their own egos.  They may try to crush you.  However, you must become one with these people too.

I recommend people look into the endless yet simple meaning of this song.  We go through life assuming that our experiences are our own they are simple reflections of our past.  They are not ours to claim but we continue to do so. People believe life is full of problems and we are raised to think that there is only external cures for them.  When the cure for all problems is found in a state of mind.\n\r\n    After following my perceived path of enlightenment, I have learned more about myself in the first 11 hrs than a lifetime of therapy and prescriptions could have ever offered me.  There is a higher level, I wish this feeling upon anyone who is willing to take everything they hold to be true in this physical world and shatter them.\n\r\n  Its been 4 years since the start of my journey, and I am still so far away, but like anything worthwhile it's far from easy. Unlike other people that share these beliefs, I don't think our minds are mature enough to ever achieve \"nirvana\" or a full understanding of the non-physical world.  Like many people, I started this path with the hope of achieving \"enlightenment\", but I shortly came to the conclusion I had become, unknowingly, a puppet of my own ego.  It's not about enlightenment, it's about the deepest possible understanding of your subconscious and coming to the realization that we victims of our own mental shortcomings(Ego predominantly).  And once you fully understand that we are flawed by this, you can take steps in everyday life to, as Maynard states, \"Crucify the ego\".\n\r\n*note - Since the installment of this idea, my life has meaning. I love everyday like it were my last.  Many people love there emotions to much to let go of them, but what they cant see is that happiness is just a controlling aspect of our ego keeping us lokked in our primal state of conscious.  Take a chance, feel the connection with every ounce of life in this world and I'll guarantee you will never crave the shallow happiness again.  This is song about the path to pure bliss. \n\r\nUnderstand yourself, this world is based upon our perceptions of it. Knowing that along with deep understanding of our mind, will allow you to shape/control your own emotions.  Everyone that has read all of this and wants to better themselves, I ask you to look for the meaning of life. It is out there. We have just been raised to look in all the wrong places. \n\r\nThis song is the only thing in this world that can make me shed a tear every time i hear it.

Suffering is apparent.  Then the \"It's calling me\" can be seen as a calling to uptake the Great Work, which is the union of man and the Godhead.  Then the moon (symbol of feminine energies) leads him to realize that the light is not his own.  The light, can be the Body of Light, which when we die reincarnates into another body.  The millions of light reflections is the energies passing on, coming into new life, it's a symbol of death and rebirth.  It is a reflection of what is to happen to the light which is not his.\n\r\nThe verse after this, he talks of a feminine energy.  \"Without her we are lifeless satellites, dreaming dreams.\"  I take this as his view upon Nuit, the goddess that the first chapter of the Book of the Law (the main text of Thelema) deals with.  She is infinite space, and infinite stars.  Everyone orbits their own path within Her body.  This universal consciousness leads to the want to destroy the ego and to quit soothing petty narcissism.  He is now practicing the path to achieving the Great Work, before he \"pines away.\"  After this, \"and you will come to find, we are all one mind,\"  describes realization we are all in one body, all a source of Light, of God, or however you wish to perceive it. He is not attained this enlightenment, and is spreading it to others, asking them to let the light come through, to achieve the Great Work.  now, instead of \"before I pine away\" it's \"before WE pine away.\"  He has let go of the ego, and now instead of selfish thoughts of himself he is know aware of spreading the light to others.\n\r\nI tried to describe this the best I can in my own viewpoint.  I would love to go in depth with more references that could possibly be compared to Thelemic philosophy, but I doubt that a lot of people on here wouldn't know what I'm talking about.

It is mostly about connecting with your higher self (the moon, as symbolism). \n\r\n\"This light is not my own.\" Our higher selves (the real \"us\", call it spirit or whatever you call the animating force behind your body) connect to thousands of other bodies that we live in different \"times\". Our higher selves are indeed \"bright and endless\", when seen from without they have a glow to them, almost like the inside of a light bulb. \n\r\n\"As I pull my head out, I am without one doubt...\" This line reflects seperating our astral body from our physical body. First step to connecting with your higher self. Once this is done, Maynard realizes we are not physical beings, but immortal and eternal. The ego is what holds us back from evolving spiritually. We get caught up in thinking that we are our bodies, our houses, jobs, whatever. In order to proceed in our journey, its necessary to leave our physical bodies and lives and egos behind.

A naturally occurring compound in plants and every human being on this planet. Theorised to be what causes dreams.\n\r\nAfter first trying to decipher this, before my knowing about DMT, I just assumed this song was about changing a negative mindset on life to a positive one to find peace and happiness etc. But now that I've been doing a bit of research and reading a few accounts of people who have experienced the awesomely intense power of DMT, I'm now lead to believe this song, along with Parabola, is about an ego death from a DMT trip.\n\r\nLines like 'crucify the ego before it's far too late' give it away for me.\r\nAlso, reading many accounts of DMT trips, one of the main revelations people have is that we are all one mind, all connected etc, ie, 'So crucify the ego before it's far too late to leave behind this place, so negative and blind and cynical\r\nAnd you will come to find that we are all one mind, capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable'.\n\r\nThat's my interpretation of this song and I think I'm pretty spot on (sounds like I need to crucify MY ego).\n\r\nScratch.\n\r\nOh and also, watch this:\nyoutube.com/\u2026\n\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong.\r\n-Reef.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_203": "\nThis song is about the Narcissus myth.
