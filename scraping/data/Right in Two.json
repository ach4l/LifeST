To me it sounds like a progression of battle music from primitive times to the industrial war machine of now. Here me out. The music goes through stages. \n\r\nThe sound begins with sticks drumming. Imagine mankind in its infancy and small groups of men battling. As the drums beat faster around 4:40 we are now in an age of larger tribes warring. At 5:24 mankind has progressed into full on organized warfare. The sound here is heavier, more complex. The guitar screeching at 6:02-6:04 transitions to a new era of battle music. The guitar is the sound of a new battle cry, more aggressive and dangerous. The sound from here on out is more industrial, the drums hit harder like artillery rounds. The guitars scream like assault rifles. At 6:45 is another transition. The industrial war machine now marches forward melodically, with calculated moves, set out to destroy everything in its path.\n\r\nAnyways, that's my interpretation of the sound and I'm sticking to it. The sound from 4:00 minutes out progresses from monkeys marching to the sound of sticks hitting coconuts to the sounds of the industrial war machine of today. Tool is a band that speaks with more than just it's lyrics.\n\n\n\n", "comment_1": "\n\"Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability\r\nto live tonight in heaven,\r\nconscious of his fleeting time here.\"\n\r\nSeriously, how beautiful and poignant is that.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI have bad news for everyone who wrote about this one. Unfortunately you have to really delve into this song and understand that everything he references through imagery is a metaphor. This song is about separation. And not just from each other but from God. We as humans are extension of the ego, and the ego tries to separate everything into more pieces because that is its true nature. But the separation only exists in our minds. We all know Tool is/was a huge Bill Hicks fan, and this was something he discussed from time to time. We as conscious humans believe there are multiple parts to everything, but we really are one whole entity. The more we try to cut things in two the further we are from our true selves and our true happiness. We are all actually in the \"garden\" the songs referencing right now, but we separate ourselves from it in our minds because we need to feed the ego.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThe meaning of the phrase 'right in two' is straight from the bible: 1 kings 3 16-28:\n\nKing Solomon, the wisest man to ever live is holding court.\n\nThe case is that of a child, and two women claim to be the mother, each saying that the child of the other died in the night, and her own live child was stolen.\n\nThe king said bring a sword, and orders that the living child be 'cut in two', and half be given to each woman.\n\nThe real mom immediately gives up her claim, willing to give up her child rather than see it killed. Fake mom says, sure, this seems a fair settlement. Solomon then correctly awards custody to the rightful mother.\n\nWe silly monkeys are like fake Mom, fighting to the bitter end, willing to divide things in two, destroying them in the process, in the interest of 'fairness', but without regard for the end result.\n\nThis seems a departure for Tool, using the bible with out sarcasm, but the song is about human nature, not biblical truth. In this case, the story from the bible happens to fit perfectly.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI love this song. Anyone who's interested in the meaning of the lyrics should watch the first 15 minutes of the movie \"2001: A Space Oddysey\" (the one made by Stanley Kubrick, not the newer one)... It might give you some insight into the meaning of this song, as well as Tool in general.\n\r\nThe first 15 minutes of the movie takes place at the \"Dawn of Mankind\" - there are two packs of primitive humanoid apes (apparently representing our ancestors). One pack of apes is drinking at a watering hole, and then the other pack invades their territory and scares the first pack away.\r\nLater on, the first pack of apes (the one that had been evicted from their own watering hole) encounter a strange black monolith that had suddenly appeared in the middle of their den. After being frightened at first, they all reach out an touch the smooth black monolith. \n\r\nAfterwards, the first pack of apes is suddenly gifted with the curiosity of technology, and one of the apes discovers that he can use animal bones as a club to fight off the second pack of apes. Him and his posse all arm themselves with femurs from some dead animal, and proceed to beat the shit out of one of the rival apes. In doing so, they scare off the second pack of apes, and win back their watering hole.\n\r\nThere is no real explanation of the mysterious 'black monolith' throughout the movie, but perhaps it is merely symbolic of \"technology\", or simply a metaphor for the concept of a \"Tool\". Its presence in the minds of the apes caused them to begin thinking abstractly, such that they were able to develop their own tools.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nOk. Im robotripping right now listening to this song and i had a breakthrough, trash me if im wrong. But when he says \"silly monkeys, where theres one, your bound to divide it, right in two,\" hes saying if you have one good thing you should share it. But no. We don't. The humans would rather cut it in two and have 2 lesser things. Then they cut those 2 things in two.

Unless MJK actually got on here and explained what goes on in his mind none of us is right. \r\n Angels on the sideline - Angels are sent here on earth to be our protectors and do help us along the path of righteousness. They sit there watching over us until they are called upon to do God's bidding. This is what they are thinking: They are puzzled because \"Father\" (God) gave his children (\"humans\") the right to choose what to do. They are amused because they are wondering what we will do with this newly given right. They humans dont actually know what to do with it yet because they just have recieved it. I think this is also referring to the Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve were made, and, therefore, humanity was created. God makes no mistakes so He has given them all they could ever want. But despite that fact, the greed in all of us comes out when we don't choose to do the right thing (what is correct in God's eyes). He now blesses humans with reason. He gives them the power to decide what to do, making us above every other living thing placed on this earth. The angels are baffled and confused because they are reaching this rediculous idea of fighting and killing each other over peices of land (because of greed). The angels are still confused at the fact that when God gives humans working hands, they create weapons to cause pain and suffering to other humans over stupid things.\n\r\nNow from a more deeper and meaninful experience, Maynard obviously wants us to dig deeper into his lyris and find more meaning to his songs. I will attempt to make a stab at it, and probably fail miserably...\n\r\nGod places things here on earth for our pleasure and to pass the time until he welcomes us into the gates of heaven. Now, part of the deal is that we have to accept him as our creator, and as our father, and spread his teachings and wisdom with the world. These material things that he gives us wasn't meant to make us jealous and want us to fight over them, but to use them as intended: live with what you have to have and give up what you don't need for God. (if you're looking for that in the bible, peter is a good example) But we can't take these things into heaven, the greatest place, an intangeable object to our minds (unless we reach 46 & 2 of course!). We have to learn to live with each other and not fight over things that matter but rather, embrace one another with love and respect because we all have something in common. We are all striving to make it into heaven and it can be easier to do that in unity with one another rather than fighting all the time over things that have no true value. Peace throughout the world is the greatest goal for the human race, and until every single person living on earth right now agrees and follows that, we will always have fighting and war. \n\r\nDamn what a long post sorry about that I just had to get that out of my system. Hope someone agrees with me, if you don't, argue in a civilized manner and I'll respect you. Otherwise, dont say anything because all you\"ll be doing is making yourself look like an idiot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_7": "\nI know this is obnoxiously long...but I just copied my english project which was that I had to analyze a song. so here. There could be many different interpretations of this song. In my opinion, this song is about war, hatred and selfishness in general. I believe the over-all message of this song is that there is a lot of pointless fighting and hatred going on for no reason. Possessions such as land could much more easily be shared rather than taking lives over them. Whatever can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be shared, there is enough of for everybody. The line: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAngels on the sidelines baffled and confused. Father blessed them all with reason, and this is what they choose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d is saying that, as humans, we have the ability to reason and use logic, and should be using those abilities for good. But instead of coming up with solutions, we choose unnecessary fighting and hatred. This is also why I believe Maynard refers to humans as monkeys; we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tend to think about what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing or look for easier, more peaceful solutions to our problems. Also, as humans, we tend to take what we need, if not more, and whatever we want, usually without giving any regard to who we may be taking from. It is for this reason that I believe the line: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go around? Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys, where there's one you're bound to divide it right in two\u00e2\u0080\u009d is used.  Some of the words used in the rhyme scheme of this song are: confused, choose, ground and down. Maynard also uses personification in this song when he says: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAngels on the sideline again, benched along with patience and reason\u00e2\u0080\u009d Repetition is also often used in lines such as: \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cFight till they die over sun, over sky, They fight till they die over sea, over air, they fight till they die over blood, over love, they fight till they die over words, polarizing\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Sickimage from songmeanings.net states that the Angels are interpreting what they see in humans. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just humans, but we were given all these things (thumbs) that are supposed to make us \"better\" than other animals, yet, we still act like animals\u00e2\u0080\u00a6we kill each other and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no need for it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6we fight for land, yet, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough for everyone to live in peacefully.

The first stanza shows the Angels amusement when God first grants the humans with freewill. The Angels seem to think that the behavior of the Humans is a big joke at first. After all, the Angels also have been granted freewill and they have managed to live in harmony. The Angels have past God's test. Humans were given gifts, such as freewill and thumbs in attempt to make them  \"Different\" from other animals. This was another one of God's test. Yet, even with these gifts, they still act like animals. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilly monkeys give them thumbs. They make a club And beat their brother, down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d. They kill each other without realizing that there is no need for it.  Constantly fighting for land yet there is enough for everyone to live in peacefully. Again, the Angels are referenced. However, now they are no longer amused with the situation. Instead the poem now depicts them as, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBaffled and confused\u00e2\u0080\u009d. They cannot understand why the humans will not live together in peace. Instead they try to kill each other. The whole \"right in two\" line that repeats truly emphasizes the idea that we cannot live harmoniously as humans. Instead, much like animals, we are territorial and must have individual possessions. The last stanza once more references the Angels. They still watch as the humans who have made no progress towards living in harmony. Instead, the Angels are now  \u00e2\u0080\u009cBenched along with patience and reason\u00e2\u0080\u009d. They realize they mistake made by giving the humans a chance.

The lyrics that I hear, while they may not be correct, are:\n\"Fight over cloud over earth over sky\nThey fight Over love over blood over hell and light\nOver love over sun over flood\nThey fight or they die over one for uprising!\"\n\nI agree that the song is essentially about the angels ridiculing man(monkeys) for fighting to claim everything which isn't theirs to begin with. The lyrics i've posted can add backing to the notion, ridiculing the causes people fight for to begin with. The last line really hooks me. They fight or they die over one for uprising. I can imagine the \"one\" being Jesus who caused an uprising and was crucified for the behaviour. And now these confused monkeys are fighting in the name of that one up-riser but are truly no better than the ones who had slain him.\nAlso, dividing/cutting in two can be seen as destroying something, sharing something, or creating something (Cells dividing in two.)

You said that its just a metaphor to explain how people fight to divide everything they don't want to share, but I think it's incorrect, cause it says multiple times \"divide it RIGHT in two\". So I guess it's important to understand why there must be TWO precise parts, and Tool are always intrested in the deep meanings of numbers. \nMy interpretation (and I've had it since the first listening of this masterpiece) is that the angels came to the conclusion that Heaven and Earth must be divided and separated, so the unity of the world as we know it must be divided RIGHT in those two parts. The divine things must be set apart from the terrestrial things, just not to do the same error again, cause people cannot use wisely the divine powers, like it happened with the free will gift. That'd easly explain the \"RIGHT in TWO\" concept, and also the fact that it says \"cut IT ALL right in two\" and not just \"we must cut EVERYTHING right in two\", and also \"where there's ONE you have to divide it right in two\". Also, do not forget that we are reading the song from the angel's point of view \"wondering when this tug of war will end\": mankind constantly fighting to reach the divine power and killing everyone to rule over the world, like God is doing. That's why the world must be divided: Adam and Eve started with this sin long time ago.\nFor me, that's the perfect interpretation of the song, hope to have opened some of your third eyes ^^\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_26": "\nRight in two is a line from the Bible: 1 Kings 3 16-28.\n\nKing Solomon, the wisest man to ever live is holding court.

It talks about how before the 1st humns, animal consciousness was a prerational and unselfconscious. When Adam and Eve began to be self-aware, they started on their 1st stages of rationality. The rational mind can distinguish one thing from another. So the early humans had to deal with anxiety of their newly precieved seperation from each other and their enviornment, all while having  a strong sense of their own mortality. The 1st humans understood their own mortality and were responsible for their own actions, thus the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. McKenna says, maybe the early hominids, being omnivorous, one day discoverd and ate some kind of psychedelic plant. These plants sharpend the hominids perception, so that they could \"sense\" predetors better that the ones not taking psychedelics. This could have given the edge on their competetors, making them the ones to survive. I think Intesion and Right in Two are about this very theory.

He's not talking about dividing anything when he says cut it all right in two. He's talking about the tug of war battle that's been going on since the start of civilization between humans. The tug of war battle relates to the \"schism\", and the \"grudge\" in that we have this grudge (our religious beliefs), which seperates us, causes tension, a schism, if you will, and the result is this ongoing tug of war battle. \n\r\nSo until we choose to let this grudge go, (accept that we are all humans, and none of us can explain why we're here or how the universe came into existence with certainty) the tug of war battle will continue to rage on.\r\n\"The light that fueled the fire then, has burned a hole between us so, we can not seem to reach an end, cripling our communication.\" - Schism\n\r\nOur differences in beliefs (that were designed to guide us into peace and harmony) has created a huge burden, the tug of war match, the schism, that will continue to plague our species until we individually make the chose to let go of the grudge, Accept the truths about the reality of religion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_80": "\nTo me, this sounds like the angels watching the humans using violence to solve everything; ownership, love, and overall just fighting over stupid shit, and the angels seem to be wondering; \"Why did God make these humans so stupid?\"\n\r\nHeh, ironic how I agree with them, even though I don't even believe in the angels and whatnot anymore....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_81": "\nI think that this song could be a criticism of religion. \n\r\nAt frist he says \"Why did Father give these humans free will?/now they're all confused\" saying that when humans only had free will, they got confused because they didn't know what to do.

But then he says \"And this is what they choose/monkey killing monkey killing monkey over peices of the ground\", imlying that people used the reason and free will blessed to them by god for the wrong reasons. \n\r\nHe is saying that when you have free will and you combine that with reason, you start to use reason to justify your free will and visa versa. In other words, you justify your need for something by using reason. \n\r\nFor example, say you want a candy bar. That was free will you just used by saying you wnat a candy bar because no one told you to have a candy bar-you're the one that wants it.

Why am I here? What is the Purpose of Life? etc... \n\r\nThese questions lead us to contemplating the nature of the being/intelligence some call God, the universe and our place in it. Naturally, when contemplating the universe we look to the sky and the heavens as the starting point of the journey (think early astronomers, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, etc...). \n\r\nThey were exploring sky and space not for the sake of the task itself, and not even for the sake of \"science,\" (although modern science was born out of their early efforts) but as a way of trying to understand the characteristics and laws governing the physical world, time and space... existence itself, very specifically their own existence, but also that of all other people as well.\n\r\nOur existences are like fire. We spark into existence and burn for a short time then extinguish. There is, cosmically speaking, a very miniscule amount of time involved in the span of even the longest-lived human being's lifetime. And yet, we squander it.\n\r\nKnowing our inherent mortality, we should be able to understand the fleeting nature of our own lifetime. \n\r\nTo understand our imminent mortality and yet practice willful ignorance as to our origin, destination and purpose; to not even begin the long and arduous journey toward understanding and enlightnment (a path on which MJK and likely the rest of TOOL have well advanced) is to live in a primitive and lowly state of existence, like uncivilized and blissfully ignorant \"talking monkeys.\"\n\r\nRepugnant indeed. \n\r\nI'm also of the mind to think that the last line in the \"Fight over...\" section (currently blank with an asterisk) says, \"Fight over lies and ME.\" I think the fighting over me part directly references this and other lyrics websites where 'We the Users' gather to collectively discuss, debate, refute, belittle, flame, foment, badger, fight, piss, bitch, and moan to each other over our interpretations of TOOL's music.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_132": "\nAs a follow up, please see Plato's \"Allegory of the Cave\" which explains the process of coming to knowledge/enlightenment from the dark cave of human ignorance.\n\r\nThe reason Plato is important is because he was Socrates' pupil and Socrates himself never wrote anything down.

Thus, the album was titled 10,000 days and the song 10,000 days is about her life and death. \"10,000 days in the fire is long enough, you're going home.\"\n\r\nTrexor... please take your ignorance elsewhere.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_138": "\ni just have a comment on all the tool fans here. including myself, isnt it funny that one of the meanings of the bands name describes all of us?

Yeah thats right, I said it. I mean I listen to this song and it feels like 2 minutes has past when its over. But anyways, this song got me thinking about something. \n\r\nThis song is written from an Angel's point of view of humans. That spread the idea that MAYNARD could be an Angel. I laughed at first. It doesnt seem possible. People are always saying that MAYNARD is God, and I always thought they were crazy. Well now, it doesn't seem all impossible. I don't think that MAYNARD is God, but; I do think it is possible that HE could be a higher being of some sort. All of TOOL could be. I just think that THEIR music is to good to be written by any other band. Anyone else agree with that? \n\r\nAll THEIR songs are masterpieces, they are so perfect; to perfect. To perfect to be written by human anyways... I'm probably just going TOOL crazy right now but I really do believe this right now. Maybe its just me, and by the post' other people are putting up about TOOL I'm probably not alone; THEY are the perfect type of music for my taste. THEY stand miles above all other bands I like.\n\r\nIn case your wondering why I keep capitalizing TOOL and MAYNARD and all words associated with TOOL, its because THEY are such a GREAT BAND, that THEY deserve to be capitalized.

Ive used Tools music as background in creating art, writing papers and even in inspiring me to continue to help people suffering from alcoholism and addiction and to build on my own spiritual journey through life. Now that Ive said that, I love the endless potential for meaning in this song, its been said Im sure but I believe that its the bands hope for all of us to make these songs our own in how we react to them and translate the message. Thats what makes it great, thats what makes it art! For me it was when I was senior in high school at the Tool show in Albany, NY, 2001. Maynard's message was for each individual in the audience to remember the feeling he/she was having to take it home with them and use it to create something that will heal everyone. This music has helped me recognize the trials and shortcomings of suffering from the human condition and how to keep going to see where we are wrong to see a bigger picture, to see everything fucked up and then to act upon it. The applications are endless. Ive seen this song translated in so many ways, of course all of them cant be right but many are backed with very interesting explanations why? the one that I am still unsure of is this part: they fight or they die, over what? _____________. this line right here, Ive read many possible lines but some dont really make that much sense can someone clear this up with uttmost certainty?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_195": "\nIt's \"Fight till/or they die, over what?

Allow me to explain via a little history\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\r\nJudaism is one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oldest religions. It has been around far longer than both Islam and Christianity. Christianity just so happens to be a direct offshoot of Judaism. It was a group of Jews who believed that a Jewish man was the incarnation of God and the messiah of all humanity. They became his disciples and followed the ideals that he taught. They also went from land to land, sharing their good news with all who they could reach. Jesus was crucified, the New Testament was written, and Christianity was formed, as a direct offshoot of Judaism. \n\r\nThe Islamic \u00e2\u0080\u009cJesus\u00e2\u0080\u009d, of sorts, was Muhammad. He was a caravan man, which made him rather lacking in wealth. His source of money was, in fact, a widow who owned a large trading company, and therefore had access to a large sum of cash. When Muhammad created the Islamic faith, he borrowed many ideals from the Christian, Judaic, Hindu, and a other religions, thus creating a likeness, and your assumption of the same God.\n\r\nWhen Muhammad had to choose a singular god for his Islamic faith, he chose the Arabic god, Allah. For those lacking in knowledge of old Arabic gods, Allah was the God of the Moon, one of the two primary gods, along with the Sun. Allah was a male god who chased the sun god (a female by the name of which I do not currently have knowledge of), as to old times, it was the man who sought the women?\n\r\nNow, that says a little something, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? A man who owed all his wealth to his wife, and not himself, chose a male god, and, in fact, made women the lesser counterparts of men in his new faith.\n\r\nI believe that constitutes to research, eh?\r\n_____\n\r\nJackrules, boy is this going to be fun.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the meaning of this song is to make a bunch of bitchy crybabies cry and bitch to each other because they can't agree. It's ironic, really.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nFollowed by\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh and to Vulken, you don't think Christianity uses violence to spread it's message? Or even Judaism. All religion is in fact the same. It's fucking stupid and if you aren't smart enough to realise that there's no supreme being and when you die you just rot in the ground, you really need to wake the fuck up, because it's two thousand mother fucking seven. Everyone should be an atheist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThat sounds a bit like whining and bitching, ironic, no?\n\n\r\nYou want to know what really is ironic? Atheism. The entire idea itself is and oxymoron. It states that there is no god to speak of, and no afterlife. Death is the end and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that, right? Do you not see the irony yet?\n\r\nHmm, can you prove that there is no god? Can you show me this amazing evidence that will solve millennium of struggle? No, I imagine you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Therefore, atheism is a belief, just as much as any religion. The funny thing about it is, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a belief (or lack thereof) in a higher power, thus making it a religion. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a religion that does not believe in a religion. Sounds rather ridiculous when put in such obvious terms, no?\n\r\nChristianity does not use violence to spread. None at all. No where in the Christian, or Judaic, Bible does it authorize the use of violence in the name of conversion and growth. It does, however, authorize the right to fight for the safety of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nation, although not under the name of God and not to spread Christianity.\n\r\nHowever, the Muslim faith states that the only guarantee to get into Heaven, or whatever you want to call the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood\u00e2\u0080\u009d afterlife, is to perform in the jihad (\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe struggle\u00e2\u0080\u009d). You have to kill infidels or be slain in the battle against infidels to go to Heaven, upon which time you also receive 72 virgins (or some odd number like that). Now, considering the Muslim outlook upon women, where does that leave them? They aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allowed to fight in the jihad, so there is no guarantee for them to go to Heaven. Says something about our good friend Muhammad, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that jihad translates to \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe struggle\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Did you also know that Hitler wrote a book called Meinkumpf (sp?), which also translates to \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy struggle\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Just a little tid bit for you right there.\r\n ____\n\r\nAnd every one of you who disagrees with this war on terrorism. I would absolutely love a peaceful world with no wars, killing, stealing, plundering, rape, and all those terrible things. I would. But we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sit back and let Muslim fascists (yes, despite what you may have been told, they are fascist) kill and terrorize innocent people. Sure, there have been some mistakes and dumbass decisions in the process, but who better to stop terrorism than America, the country that stands for freedom above all else? \n\r\nYou think we should let China, or the UN handle this? Ha, as if. \n\r\nAnd we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just give them what they want to make them stop either. They did it with Hitler, and guess what? WWII started because of it. We must learn from our past, or the same mistakes are bound to repeat themselves.\n\r\nTo quote jackrules, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou really need to wake the fuck up, because it's two thousand mother fucking seven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n ____  \n\r\nOne last tid bit for you guys.

If the universe is so ordered that it requires an even more orderly creator, isn't that a contradiction? If you follow that line of reasoning, God, being infinitely ordered, would require an infinitely more ordered creator, and that creator in turn would require an even greater creator, and so on and so forth. \n\r\nThat, my friend, is an infinite regress.

He is almost certainly not talking in the guise of himself as the character voice of the song.\n\r\nIf you knew about Tool mythology you'd know the band was formed out of anger and hatred of oppression. All of the members of Tool, including MJK, hate anything which sets itself up as a guiding voice or someting to be followed blindly (and the big beardy guy is up there) [P.S. I don't mean Santa Claus]. That's why the band delight in misinforming their own fans, to remind them not to take Tool as a religion either and think for themselves.

Most Tool songs have layers of meaning. Layer one is pretty apparent, it is almost a lamentation by 'Angels' between themselves, or one Angel to itself, about how God created humanity, and humanity seems bent on destroying and fighting with itself. I adore the lyrics here just for their evocative use of words, MJKs word choice is almost scalding of humanity, and his voice echoes through Tool's dulled down sound, evoking for me even more Angel imagery.\n\r\nThough there is and irony in one of the lines\r\n\"Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability\r\nto live tonight in heaven\"\r\nMJK cleverly sets the Angel(s) up as hypocrites, rejecting the 'silly' monkeys (at first we think rightly, for they are self destructive) but then we realise God gave the monkeys free will, yet the Angels mock when the monkeys don't choose to do the same as they have done. MJKs view on God for me, in this song is neuteral, but he does use the monkeys and Angels as a microcosm.\n\r\nPerhaps he is referring to the monkeys being given free will, in the hope they will justify the Angels belief in themselves, and when the monkeys begin to destroy each other the Angels find it more difficult to justify themselves.\n\r\nJust thoughts here, I'm brainstorming.\n\r\nFeel free to drop me a PM.

It is just a language difference; similarly Dios is the Spanish word for God. \n\r\nas for Vulcen's \"research\", he seemed to miss the little bit about how Muslims acknowledge the profits of the Christian and Judaic faiths. Islam takes that procession one step further by saying that Muhammad was the final prophet. He was not the Islamic \"Jesus\" in the since that he was the son of God, for he was not the son of god. He was just the vessel through which god's word could be spread. \n\r\nYour opinions about Islam and the Muslim world are based only on the fraction of Islamic fundamentalism which you see in the news media. \n\r\n\"However, the Muslim faith states that the only guarantee to get into Heaven, or whatever you want to call the \u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdgood\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd afterlife, is to perform in the jihad (\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bdthe struggle\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bf\u00c2\u00bd).

This type of Jihad was regarded as the greater jihad (al-jihad al-akbar).\r\n    * Jihad by the tongue (jihad bil lisan) is concerned with speaking the truth and spreading the word of Islam with one's tongue.\r\n    * Jihad by the hand (jihad bil yad) refers to choosing to do what is right and to combat injustice and what is wrong with action.\r\n    * Jihad by the sword (jihad bis saif) refers to qital fi sabilillah (armed fighting in the way of God, or holy war), the most common usage by Salafi Muslims and offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\r\nOnly one includes violence, and that inclusion does not mean \"killing Infidels\", it means killing in the way of god. \n\n\n\r\nThe problem with our societies is that there are people like you who use your faith as a shield and your ignorance as a spear; you pass judgment on a faith that you have no true knowledge of, and you make the same fallacious argument that you think your \"enemies\" make. \n\r\nDo you want to know why the monkeys kill monkeys?\n\r\nlook in the mirror     \n\n\n", "comment_283": "\nMountainman112358, I couldn't agree more.\r\nThis song is very good btw :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_284": "\ni always thought right in two was like, you got it right in two guesses, but i guess i wasn't really listening to the rest of the song... amazing though\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_285": "\nJust for the record, Judaism, Christianity and Islam all pray to the God of Abraham.

He led a portion of the Angels to rebel against God partially due to the fact that God gave humans souls which the Angels lack and placed them above the angels in his love. Satan and the others who sided with him hated the humans because of their place in God's heart and for the foolish decisions humans made, the first being to choose death and the knowledge of good and evil over life in Eden. The Angels were created first and told to serve God only. Then God created humans and told the Angels they would serve the humans as well. This caused an irreconcilable conflict among Satan and his followers who could not realign their service to God to include his command to serve His chosen, humans. \nI have heard that the members of Tool consider themselves \"Satanists\" which is not to say black magic and all that crap but more of Stanism as the true rebuking of religion and human being focused free will. Many of their songs speak to this ideology and also reference the beliefs of organized religion, particularly Christianity.

People are dieing everyday for the silliest reasons and God does nothing for them. \"How they survive so misguided is a mystery\" is funny because it comes off as if someone guided them, perhaps God? God is misguiding the human race and yet they are surviving. They are surviving because science is conquering religion. \"Cut and divide it all right in two\" is just a way of saying kill, at least in the context of the song. \n\nMonkeys are continuously used to refer to humans. Not only because we behave like monkeys, but they are also a close ancestor. I feel like the close ancestor is more relevant because our brains are just a more developed monkey brain. We should realize this and use that difference to understand that violence is not the answer. It sucks though because we have dug the human society as a whole into a big hole so it would be very difficult to bring world peace. However, it is still possibly to rid the world of fear. Imagine a world where everyone appreciated each other, imagine the prosperity. No money would need to go into military expenses. everyone could have shelter and education. At this point It would have be a global reform, even then there would be problems. \nAnyway, I'm off topic. \n\nThe song is about the stupidity of Humans over their history, It's not completely their fault because a lot of them were misguided. The human mind was ignorant and therefore gullible. This might sound like a conspiracy and it might now be a joke on God, but I guess none of us really know.

You need to watch the video too, its fantastic and explains so many of the lyrics. \n\nNow with reference to the Angels, I think that they have a double meaning, one being Angels, assistants of God and tasked with watching over our development. Secondly I believe they're also being referenced to our higher consciousness, as in the the rational side of our mind, the side that is intelligent enough to live in peace. I draw this conclusion from the video, because the creator in the video is quite clearly your average man, he isnt illustrated as a divine character whos wearing a robe and has a big grey beard. I think this is saying that we are the masters of our own destiny. We're the ones that have forged everything we use and we will be the ones that ultimately destroy ourselves, exactly how the little minions destroy the creator in the video.\n\nIts an epic song and I will never tire of listening to it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_333": "\n@heartagramheat I love it man you hit this right on the head.

The use of angels is the irony, because people believe they exist, but really, people are simply fighting over things and killing one another because they can.

I say thus even though I have never used another inclusive song meanings website.  I came here hoping to find Christians' comments so I can reply to them.  You see them incorrectly so often on hundreds of song (that and the \"every sing is about drug addiction1\" crowd), yet strangely I see none here.  Many of Tool's songs are confusing because they talk about Christianity as though they were promoting it, and you sometimes can find the spot where they're taking an activist or sarcastic position against it.  Which, by the way, they always ate, Tool is extremely anti-Christianity and at least half if their songs are about that.\n\r\nAlthough there are no Christianity-related comments here, the complete and utter lack of depth given in the meanings posted here is amazing.  Tool is is an extremely depth-filled band that makes Dan Brown-level puzzles out of their CDs (or at least out of Lateralus).  A mere \"Hey stop killing each other\" has been done by like every activist band ever, and 85% of the rest of rock bands as well.  Even Hollywood Undead, who frequently talk about \"bang sluts,\" does this.  My own explanation, because it is based only on the obvious lyrics right in front of you and is not even relaying to other songs on this CD, will most definitely be missing at least two aspects.\n\r\nThis song, first, mentions \"Christians say why did God give free will?.\"  This alone is multi-faceted, with the two biggest meanings being that 1) Christians want drones - \"Why should we have free will?  God should direct us so that were all moronic puppets with a pointless existence!,\" Christians think and 2) Certain types (they don't say the \"certain types\" part) ofChristians claimto want peace and happiness for people.  They also say \"How they survive so misguided is a mystery,\" referring to Christians, but using it ironically, that the \"misguided\" ones according to the Christians are those who don't believe in their gods and cause.  And yet...\n\r\nCHRISTIANS are the ones killing over pieces of the ground.  In the second chorus this is revealed from the previously ironic statements which are said by those who believe in Allah or Jehovah.  \"Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability to live in heaven.\"  \"Cut it in two,\" \"these stupid fools are killing reach other instead of following our god.  Repugnant are such people, let's go kill them.\"  And the angels watch \"confused\" (a metaphor of course, a Thelemic-like interpretation of the word \"angel\".
