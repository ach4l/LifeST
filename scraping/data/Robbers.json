Never in my life have I seen a music video that is this accurate and beautifully made to say the least. It gets the song down to perfection. \n\nI think this song is about infatuated lovers overcome by the lust, the drugs, the thrill, the danger, and the flawed lens that they see each other through. \n\nShe is this beautiful girl and he's this drug obsessed boy who's probably going to corrupt whatever ounce of innocence she has left. He's almost obsessed with her in a way, she's beautiful how could you ever want to leave her, and her infatuation with him only means she's not going anywhere. \n\nTo give a more literal meaning of her balaclava is starting to chafe. A balaclava is one of those wool ski masks or in this case the mask a robber would wear to cover up his identity since it only has holes for the mouth and eyes. Chafe means to wear down, meaning her mask is wearing from all the use. Often times I found that Matty's lyrics can be as literal as it gets. This song is quite possibly as simple as two lovers that are also well, robbers. And I know it's considered a love story because he's said it point blank.\n\nThe next part, one more time, one more fight, one more line, will I know you. One more time, maybe it's their last time engaging in the act of 'robbing', one more fight I think literally means one more fight. I take it this couple fights a lot, whether it be the drugs, their lifestyle which has ever ounce of danger following it or a simple verbal fight. One more line, cocaine. From other 1975 songs, cocaine is a constant repeating topic and a line refers to that. I take that as the meaning here also because from the video there's frequent drug use that backs that. Will I know you, well will he know her? Will she know him? Will they?? Its out loud thinking, one more of this, then will we understand? That's actually a little cloudy for me.\n\nFor the next part, in the video he's playing with a gun and she gets upset over it. I almost take it as he's making a joke of this with her. If you never shoot you never know, if you never eat you never grow. Those aren't comparable things really, he's taking the situation too lightly and I think that's part of the infatuated lovers idea, he's a mess, crazy almost but she's so tied to him that she'll be forgiving even when he sticks a gun to her face as a joke. The pretty kinda dirty face, she's wearing down, either by this words, their actions, whatever it is she's slowly melting away from herself and falling for everything she does. \n\nThe stay part, this is simple. In the first few lines he was begging her, he wanted her because she was beautiful and she caught his eye as this girl he could play around with. But now, she's begging him to stay. She fell for him, he almost ruined her. He's got her robbing whatever you wanna say, stores, banks, so be it. He's got her hooked on drugs. The video has him putting drugs into her mouth, it also has her doing a line of cocaine by herself among others. He was begging, and now she's begging. That's as simple as it gets, they're glued to each other basically. \n\nThen it repeats the one more time, fight, line but the last line changes. Be a riot, cause I know you. Basically, I can't say for certain if it's talking about her or him or both even but it's gotten to the point in their relationship where it doesn't matter how crazy they act or what they do or who they hurt or what drugs they're doing because they know each other, they know what to expect at this point that it's no longer an act of doing but an act of knowing. They both know, we're doing this. We're robbing this store and there's no backing out or being scared because we're crazy and we're doing it. They fully understand each other and they're now fully committed to their choices. This part of the video is very intimate, they're kissing and you see that they love each other. Toxic lovers. \n\nThis next part, in the video they're standing there in front of a store that well they're going to rob. Their friends, or the rest of the band, is waiting in a van for them. They have a plan. The video doesn't go along with this next part exactly but it's easy to understand just by the lyrics. The police have come, so their plan is complicated. I'll shoot him if that's what you ask, meaning if you want me to do this I will, showing their connection to each other and their willingness to do whatever it takes for each other and for their safety. But if you just take off your mask you'll find out everything's gone wrong. I love that line, for many reasons. But meaning to the song, there's a couple. If you take off your mask, surrender really you'll find yourself in a bigger mess. Or if you stop if you back out it's going to be worse. Something complicated their plan and showing who they are and succumbing to their failure of the task won't make it better. \n\nFor the end, I'll give the lyric and the video interpretation. For the lyrics, everybody's dead, meaning they killed the people in the place they robbed. But remember the police are there, meaning our infatuated lovers have been caught. I take it as they're put in the back seat of the cop car, they're driving through the town they pass his old school. He's got his suit on, that's the cops uniform and I see her standing there watching him, or sitting next to him. Either works because I see it two ways. He was taken into the cop car and she was left standing meaning that he was charged for the crime. But if she's next to him, then they both were. So the last line, which should be, you look so cool, it's her being in the completely flawed mindset that she's created, thinking the police taking him away is cool. He looks cool to her, basically her flawed mentality makes her think he looks like a badass being taken away by the police which is sick minded to think about when you're in the real world but she's not in the right mindset at the moment. The part of her that's obsessed with him and their lifestyle, that makes this cool to her. It's cool for the simple reason that she's saying babe you're a badass, we did this and I know you're being taken away but I love you and I love the thrill and yeah I think you get it. \n\nNow for the video, before the now everybody's dead part, which to go on a tangent and say that the way Matty sings the line, Now everybody's dead, just gives off the pure emotion of the song and it makes it raw and important. But back to the video. Before that line there's a pause and the video goes silent as they run into the store, then you hear shots. Second later the song picks up and he screams, now everybody's dead and the two run out of the store, no police are seen, but Matty is shot. They then get into the van and drive away. I think the way the lyrics go here, it could mean that they were successful in their plan except for the he being shot part of course, no one wants that. But they're driving past my old school, okay you could say they're driving past as they get away in the van being driven by their friends but I think the lyrics lose a little bit of accuracy here for the video. Then you see flashes of Matty with his gunshot wound, they're kissing, patching it up, and at the end they're at a diner I think you see him read this note that she passed to him and it says you look so cool, another reason for why those are the lyrics. But something about the video is cool if you notice it, Matty has a bandage over where his wound would be during parts of the video meaning that it's being done in flashes. So that's an interesting thing to pick up on and it tells you that the video isn't in accurate time order at points.\n\nAnyways, I hope this cleared things up for some people. I think this song is more literal then some see it but I truly think it's actually about robbers, its as simple as the title. Sometimes its best not to look into stuff so much because the answers are right there. But this song for sure has the potential to be taken other routes which I saw reading other comments and I agree with elements that other people brought up. At the end of the day, this is a love song according to the genius that is Matthew Healy. It's a toxic love story about fucked up, drug addicted lovers that are completely and utterly infatuated by each other to the point where robbing a store is okay and considered cool. It's tragically beautiful and an amazing song and if you haven't yet seen the video I urge you to watch it because I think it's one of the best music videos I ever seen and helps with clarity about the lyric meaning. Andddd that's it, thanks for reading!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song was inspired by the movie 'True Romance' and if you have seen the movie you can see where certain lines in this song were obviously written for specific quotes in the film. For example, the line 'you look so cool' was much like the line in the movie where one of the main characters named Alabama tells her husband Clarence that he's 'so cool' and she even writes on a napkin 'You're so cool!' plus one of the lines in the movie is 'You're so cool, you're so cool, you're so cool'. Many people seem to think that this song represents a painful love whereas really, the song is about two people that have fell deeply in love with each other and are practically partners in crime. 'We'll give you one more fight' implies that the two of them won't let the other fight alone and they put up a fight together as they have each others backs. \n\n'Now everybody's dead' in the movie, there's a room full of people including the police ('it's much harder now the police have come') and everyone ends up getting shot and dies apart from three people, the couple being two of the three. However, the husband gets shot but doesn't die-in the music video, Matty gets shot but it never shows him dying. \n\nI think people look too deep when really, the lyrics are what they are, there's guns, people are dying and nothing went to plan. Their love isn't painful or difficult, they're actually crazily in love and stick together through every trouble that comes along the way. \n\nI suggest watching the movie True Romance as it does truly give you a better understanding of the lyrics and it's a great film. :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nthe lyrics should be \"you look so cool.\" matt said this song was inspired by the film \"true romance,\" and the movie ends with one of the two main characters saying \"you're so cool, you're so cool, you're so cool\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nin an interview I watched once, Matty explained it as \"lovers robbing chances from each other.\" which although I think there are many themes in this song (the usual sex, drugs, etc.) it seems to be the underlying one! by the way, I believe that last lyrics are \"you look so cool.\" not cold. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI just completely fell in love with this song and the video, idk why, I'm completely obsessed with it.\nIt's so beautiful, genuine and there are so many thoughts behind it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nThis song is about being attached to a lover and not leaving them even though you should.

She's stressed and edgy and so she moderately accepts him into her life despite being distant and not trusting really anyone. (\"Her balaclava is starting to chafe\"). I think the gun in this song represents power. \"When she gets his gun\" is representing the fact that she has the reigns in the relationship and she can control what's going down. Also, note how at this point HE'S the one begging HER. \n\nI feel like when the chorus first plays its showing how even though they have their rough points and she is cold, they're giving it another shot. She's giving him a chance into her life and he's giving her another chance with the gun to \"shoot\", or put a start to their relationship. Perhaps friends with benefits? \n\nThe next stanza goes into the fact they give it a shot, (\"if you never shoot you never know\") and opens herself emotionally, perhaps by sleeping with him. Note, how this time SHE'S the one begging HIM. \n\nNow, I first heard the bridge differently than the actual lyric. I heard \"well now that you've got your gun, its much harder now to place your c*m.\" as in now that they've had sex he's acting distant and isn't really feeling it. They have the gun, or the power, and she's saying she will finally agree to progress their relationship or agree she caught feelings. (\"And I'll shoot it if that's what you ask\") But she also points out that things have changed and if they were to both drop the cold facade and really look at each other, the dynamic in their friendship has changed so drastically. (\"But if you just take off your mask, you'll see that everything has gone wrong.\") Perhaps she wants him and likes this change, or perhaps she thinks that they've changed too much for this to be. I personally felt as if she wants him and thinks deep down, he was being just as cold as her from the get go. \n\nThis next part also gets more ambiguous. (\"Now everybody's dead\"). I feel like he shot her down or backed out, or put an end to their relationship. Perhaps because he felt they changed too much, or he is no longer interested after actually getting what he had been begging for so long. \n\n\"She says 'babe, you look so cold'\". She sees him as he is and he is now playing the cold lover. She assumed that role at the beginning, but now he's the one ignoring calls or denying a relationship. Her heart is broken and they are both miserable. (\"The sky is gone, the sky is hidden\") \n\nThe title \"robbers\" is more obvious, demonstrating the fact they rob love and affection from each other, and while she was the one doing this in the beginning, in a twist at the ending he shot down any chance they had so now all the bridges are burnt. Its a deep ass song, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it since hearing it!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nAbout a couple who are in love with each other.
