{"comment_0": "\nThis is a pretty bad remix. But I am sure DY loved having Lloyd Banks and Young Buck on the track,even if it sounded like some bad DJ MADE it. Now that Daddy Yankee is on Interscope i am sure there will be further collaborations. I heard it said that DY wanted Eminem,Dre and 50 to be on his next album. Anyways the remix is pretty bad,i dont care for it much.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nWhy wood g-unit be in a song with this refugee poser?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nyankee is not a poser\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nSugar u must be a spic for u 2 b sayin this anyway gringos rule fuck latinos\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nlol...miamigringo ...what a dumbass you are! you dont know nothing jajaj\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nmiamigringo.. you are a total idiot.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nMiami Gringo...U stole my name..
