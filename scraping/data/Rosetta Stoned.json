It's a masterfully humorous song, and full of truth.\n\r\nThe part where he says \"Me, the chosen one. They chose me, and I didn't even graduate from fucking high school....\"\n\r\nIt's a sort of slap in the face to all the psychonauts and self appointed mystics and shaman who walk around acting as if, or believing, that they have been granted special access to the mysteries of life. That they have tapped into some fount of knowledge about all the Big Questions that have eluded mankind since day one. Never mind the fact that many, more powerful, minds have been unable to give us definitive answers to these questions... they have been granted special access to the answers because...why? Because they took acid and believe in ufo's? \n\r\nNo, because they are special, they have been chosen. It's a sort of narcissism, to think that you are so important that you get to know the mysteries of life that nobody else gets to know, and that you should simply be granted this knowledge and responsibility because you were wise enough to ingest a chemical that has been experimented with for most of the last century, by millions of people, some of them likely much more talented and intelligent than you.\n\r\nThe \"Rosetta Stoned\" feeling is a common occurance on lsd. I had it happen a few times when I used to take it as a teenager. You get this overwhelming feeling of having discovered some deeper, hidden meaning about life, a major revelation of some kind. But somehow, by the time you are sober again, the feeling is gone. Some faint echo of it nags at you, because it felt so real, what was it? Should have written it down...shit the bed...\n\r\nOk, so next time you take acid, and it happens again, but this time you are prepared, you brought your pen!\r\nSo you write down the essence of your revelation, this refinement of knowledge that has eluded mankind, but now you, the chosen one, can tell everyone, because you wrote it down! Good thinking!\n\r\nYou come down, and later feel that tug in your mind...what was it... oh yeah, the piece of paper! You pull it out of your pocket and read:\n\r\n\" A circle and a square are really the same thing!!!!\"\n\r\n\" \"Pink should be cherished and respected, it s here to mitigate aggression.\"\n\r\n\" If I try hard to honor you, you will try harder to honor me.\"\n\r\n\" The important number is 3!\"\n\r\nHuh?\n\r\nIs this some gibberish, and some paraphasing of ancient and well know pieces of advice like the golden rule masquerading itself to you as something you invented on your own? What happened, it doesn't feel as overwhelming to read it sober, does it? \r\nHell, none of these ideas are new, and all of them have been descibed and debated in much clearer and understandable language than this psychedelic obscuritan drivel anyhow...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nContinuation of Lost Keys, its his answer to the doctor: \"Picture this if you will\" how he was captured by aliens or a mighty power that told him to tell everyone the world was going to end.\r\nIn the beginning its a tedious song by my favorite part develops and in minute 8 of the song, Maynard reaches a great pinnacle of the song with his voice: \n\r\nOverwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position. \r\nSuch a heavy burden now to be, the one. \r\nBorn to bear and write you all the details of our ending. \r\nTo write it down for all the world to see. \r\nBut I forgot my pen. \r\nShit the bed again... typical. \n\r\nGreat finale\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis is what I get from it, it may not be what you get, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s totally fine.  Keeping in mind the three languages on the Rosetta Stone and the above quotation.\n\r\nThere are three narratives that need to be deciphered in this song.  At the beginning we have the narrative of events told by the guy who is still suffering the effects of LSD to the doctors.  The garbled sound of the lyrics seems to accentuate the nonsensical lyrics themselves.  Then we get the second narrative, his inner thoughts.  This helps us understand the first narrative, he cant explain himself because he is still really stoned, but what he has to say does make some sense.  We are missing a third narrative, which is that of the aliens.  \r\nSo then what is the Rosetta Stone, his key to unlocking the cryptic message?  The title suggests it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the LSD.  It is what allowed for the alien experience and makes the first nonsensical narrative possible, then the second more rational narrative.  The reason we are missing the alien narrative is because we have an unprepared individual with no frame of reference, he forgot his pen.  So he ends up missing the point.  You get what you can from the Rosetta Stone (LSD or the actual stone used to decrypt the hieroglyphs) but once you decrypt, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need the Rosetta Stone anymore.  Once you figure out how to read Hieroglyphs you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to translate through the stone again, you do it because you understand it.  Much like once you reach a bit of spiritual enlightenment you can \u00e2\u0080\u009cget there again\u00e2\u0080\u009d because you understand it.  The story teller was not prepared and therefore did not have the frame of reference to understand the new perspectives he encountered.  It becomes a sort of response to \u00e2\u0080\u009cThird Eye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nWhat makes this song cool to me is the humor used to poke fun at the stereotypical high school drop out that trips out just to trip out.

(LSD, DMT, whatever)\n\r\nI also think the vocals are very clever.

One of the pations is released by somone unknown to tell the world of the wrong doings, but he is to far gone from the surgeries to be able to comunicat (depicted in Lost Keys) ,or remember mutch and has very little controle of his body, and it can be assumed that he can write still but he forgot his pen...

First, because of the lucid dreamlike experiances described in the lyrics.  Secondly, because of the alien visitation.  It is common for a DMT experiance to involve alien visits, in clinical studies about 20% of tests resulted in a trip with aliens.  Another reason is the fact that many people cannot handle the intensity of the onset hallucinations and do \"shit the bed\" though I believe Maynard is using that statement to describe failure.  Also, the user questioned whether he was alive or dead.  When I drank Ayahuasca, an Oral DMT mixture with an MAOI, I had vivid hallucinations, almost dreams, of my own death multiple times.  This leads me to believe that the song is indeed about a DMT trip, even though the song preceding it is \"blame hofmann\" and we know Albert Hofmann is the scientist who first synthesized LSD-25.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_57": "\nAhh TREXOR my old friend, getting yourself in quite a bit a trouble lately it seems!\r\nI really must say that I don't think you should have opened your presents before Christmas morning! You ruined your own surprised and now your disappointed. I'm very sorry to have recently read all about it. Let me tell you a little story old buddy...\n\r\nI waited! Damn it I waited till the very last second. I didn't cheat in any way. I wanted that first listen to be pure! I was at Best Buy when the doors opened on May 2nd, at 10am and I got my long awaited treasure. I was happy as a schoolgirl, playing with Great Gatsby looking cover and bubbling over with joy. Popped it in the CD player and headed for my sons play group. \r\nWith the first listen I felt a bit like you have described, TREXOR. I felt like technically it was great and musically it was outstanding but lyrically it just seemed off. Not bad, not bad at all, I still loved it but I was feeling like Maynard's writing was lacking in something. Then it happened....\r\nThat night a good friend came over and in a few words changed the whole CD for me. He nonchalantly said, \"I think this is his (MJK) most personal stuff to date.\" I was floored. How could he even think that, he must be out of his mind! But before we could delve too deep into the subject the conversation twisted and turned and went another way. \r\nThe next morning at 8am I wanted so badly to wake his ass up and ask him how he could possibly say this was Maynard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most personal work. It grinded on me all day... and so I listened and listened and listened and read and read and by the time we met again later that day I understood.\r\nIt is brilliant; it's wonderful, glorious. The difference... it's less cryptic, it's more straight foward. It is still Tool in every way but it gives you a feeling that after all of these years they have dropped some of the formality with us all. It's almost charming. \r\nListen to every album they have made no two are alike, they are all Tool but they are also humans growing and changing and the music is a reflextion.

I'm fairly certain, but one never knows when it comes to black ops) for 'accidentally' penetrating the Restricted Zone. I have been issued (along with Danny) papers from the Installation Commander instructing me to never again trespass on the nonexistent military facility. I have a nom de plume when looking for things like the silent attack plane called \"Pumpkin Seed\", but no one seems to remember this. I have been gassed (?) and rendered unconscious while camping on Campfire Hill by mysterious persons in camouflage fatigues driving white Jeep Cherokees. I have found a scorpion in my sleeping bag in the morning (very funny, cammo dudes!) I have seen what I believe to be the greenish plasma glow of a secret experimental hypersonic craft which some call the TR-3B. I have seen extremely bright golden-orange globes suspected in the night sky (UAVs or infrared suppression flares?). I have peered down upon America's most famous secret base (which doesn't exist) from my 'bleacher' seat on Freedom Ridge (now part of the Restricted Zone) and signed the guest register (rock) with a black Sharpie. I have also spied on the extensive installation (hangers, radar facilities, fuel-tanks, etc.) through a Celestron telescope from the nearby \"White Sides\" viewpoint (also now part of the Restricted Zone). I have marked the trail leading to \"Freedom Ridge\" with highly-reflective metallic gold ribbons attached to Joshua trees (numerous times as the cammo dudes kept taking them down after I left the area). I have seen \"Old Faithful\" at 4:50 AM, but sure as hell didn't think it was anything even remotely extraterrestrial, Sean David Morton! I have passed close to silver-globed ammonia detectors and I am a human being. I have been 'sandblasted' and harassed by a modified black pavehawk helicopter equipped with \"Puff the Magic Dragon.\" I have been tailed, listened to on parabolic microphones, videotaped, and subjected to all manner of psychological warfare tactics by security personnel near the perimeter of the base. I have blasted Philip Glass' \"1000 Airplanes on the Roof\" while kicking up clouds of plutonium-laden dust in rental SUVs. I have messed with motion sensors on BLM (i.e. public land!) I have seen Kat start to get naked for a photo by the 'No Photography' signs until illuminated by blinding spotlights from the (obviously gay) cammo dudes. I have eavesdropped on sensitive military channels with a decent scanner and heard conversations between \"Dreamland Control\" and the various JANET flights. I have witnessed all sorts of activity over both Groom and Papoose dry-lake beds from the famous Black Mailbox. I have seen meteors, exploding fireballs, astronomical chromatics, strange aerial lights, red dots, unusual jet contrails, satellites (!!!), and more stars than you can imagine (including the Andromeda galaxy) on moonless nights. I have seen Joe Travis drink more cans of Old Milwaukee and smoke more cigarettes than there are stars in the night sky (even on a moonless night). I have experienced \"missing time,\" but don't necessarily think it was the result of boron-stealing EBEs who like strawberry ice cream. I have seen mutilated cattle on the unfenced range near highway 375 and almost hit perfectly camouflaged cattle standing in the middle of the road. I have hit too many jackrabbits to count on dirt spurs in the buffer zone and have been issued two speeding tickets at the Alamo speed trap by Lincoln County sheriffs. I have bought filet mignon from a Chevron gas station while on the way to Highway 375. I have taken the rusted springs from a melted M1 tank at LN 31.5 and used them as candle-holders. I have explored abandoned mine shafts and pondered the message of the sacred monument of the Aaronic Order. I have fired a Desert Eagle and an AR-15 with tracer rounds. I have seen the absurd ID4 ceremonies, and watched as the famous \"Black Mailbox\" (from the Medlin Ranch) was auctioned off for a little over a thousand dollars. I have heard tremendous sonic booms from B-2 Stealth bombers (Aurora?) that rattled the nerves of those in the Little A-le-Inn (along with the precious bottles of liquor). I have seen Norio Hayakawa sing Willie Nelson (or was it Waylon Jennings?) and other paranoid members of the anti-Illuminati give funny (unintentionally funny) speeches. I have also listened to Ambassador Merlyn Merlin II from Alpha Draconis. I have chugged cans of Budweiser while Chuck Clark sipped Diet Cokes (all the while showing me some very interesting photographs that he took in the area). I have pulled giant moths from bowls of Coyote Caf\u00c3\u00a9 salsa and from plastic cups of strong margaritas. I have found my missing half-full (I'm an optimist) bottle of Corona with a night vision scope. I have made a damn spicy Indian Vindaloo dinner on a sputtering camp stove. I have had spaghetti on Wednesday nights at the Inn (the best night to view tests of the Lazar/Testor \"sport model UFO). I have had dozens of A-le-Inn burgers (without cheese) and sampled Pat's famous chili. I have charred hotdogs over fires, and put Pat's famous chili over charred hotdogs when I probably should have been making jackrabbit stew, BUT I HAVE NEVER EATEN A KRISPY KREME DOUGHNUT AT AREA 51 or anywhere else (and I don't own a pair of Birkenstock sandals, shoes, clogs or otherwise). Therefore, the identity of the person unfortunate (or fortunate, depending on your feelings about these things) enough to have the encounter as described in \"Rosetta Stoned\" is only known by MAYNARD JAMES KEENAN (and perhaps a few others). It was not I, although I once saw a similar type out by \"Campfire Hill\"? a good place to get gassed if that's your thing.

Instead it's become one big drug discussion. I don't even think that this song has anything to do with drugs. How hard is it to believe that the speaker is not on drugs and is simply recalling an alien encounter of the Fifth kind? \n\r\nWikipedia's defination: A close encounter of the fifth kind involves direct communication between an extraterrestrial intelligence and a human being. This is the rarest and most controversial form of close encounter\n\r\nWhere on Lost Keys/Rosetta stoned does it indicate the use of hellucinogens? I don't do drugs but from the nurse's description of the speaker (No obvious signs of physcial trauma and Vital signs are stable), he seems fine to me.\n\r\nMy interpretation of the song also ties in with the idea that greater, otherworldy powers have been watching over human beings ever since the beginning and have played a major part in our growth and progression. The speaker gets abducted by extra-terrestrials and they give him information that can save the future of mankind from an impending danger. People who are abducted don't remember the experience and pass it off as merely a dream. Most of the time, people who claimed to have been abducted by aliens can actually recall the experience with the help of hypnosis. In some instances, people can remember it vividly on their own and it's usually a traumatic one, such as the speaker of the song.\n\r\nGoing back to the point, I don't see any evidence in Lost Keys/Rosetta stoned that the speaker is on an LSD trip. I mean seriously, think about it. Say the same thing happens to you and you go to the doctor and tell them that aliens abducted you, chose you to be the bearer (chosen one) on information that will save mankind. Do you think they'll believe you? No, cause it sounds ridiculous and they'll simply come to the conclusion that you've been doing drugs or on an LSD trip. Hence the title \"Blame Hofmann\".\n\r\nJust to add one more thing, we all know what the Rosetta stone is right? I've read somewhere in one of the posts saying that that LSD is the Rosetta stone for \"extra-terrestrial messages\". IMO, the speaker IS the Rosetta stone but he sounds more like he's been doing drugs, hence the \"Stoned\" part.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_98": "\nI'm going with Daggerfall on this one.

Followed by Lost Keys which is all trippy, we are with this guy on his mental journey.  The end of Lost Keys is the doctor wanting to know what happened to him.  So the beginning of Rosetta Stoned this guy is all rambling, and talking super fast as he is still feeling the effects of the drug.

You're all partly right in what this song is about but you need to try and combine all your theories. This song is talking about people with messianic complexes. It's from the perspective of a naive relligious nut that for some reason has had their very FIRST hallucenagetic drug experience and/or has had an ET encounter, I'm not exactly sure. And their own interpretation of what they saw is skewed by what they wanted to see and hear and they want to be a hero and share this with the world. Most of the lyrics DO actually make logical sense. (Not these ones, they're not accurate) But they offer a lot of good imagery into what this person is like. They make the point that this person is clearly a bafoon who never even graduated high school. Also this story rings true for all the people written about in the bible who claim to have been visited by angels and they go on to recite these seemingly endless speeches of what the angel told them, meanwhile its F-ing impossible to accurately remember that much, or resist the urge to embelish. Especially since I believe that angel sitings are actually encounters with extra-terrestrials. Who happen to look like us, since they began life on earth and watch over us like some kind of experiment. He also makes reference to L-Ron Hubbard. Who as you all know is the moron who started scientology. This might lead me to think this entire song could be about him if he actually claims to have had some kind of 'encounter' that lead him to want to start his retarded relligion, but I don't know the details behind that. So there's my shpeal on the whole bit. \n\r\nI'd also like to say in regards to those people who don't like the new Tool stuff...Ahem....F@#$! you. You don't like it because you're not evolving at the same rate that the music is. These guys aren't required to make songs a certain way in order to maintain the same fan-base. They are expressing themselves. And everything they create is pure art and they've put more thought into it than you could even imagine. These guys are geniuses and that's why I like them. I also have a theory as to the name of this song and the reason why people seem to be having such a hard time dechyphering it. It's because there are parts that have three different sets of lyrics that have similar sound qualities but they're all overlapped. Not sure though, just a possibility. So that covers what 'toolmusik' said about the rosetta stone with the three different scripts used for dechypering hyroglyphics. \n\r\nMany of the songs of this album are religiously themed. And they respectfully make very GOOD points about religion and its discrepencies and failings. And they do it with style and class.\n\r\nI tried singing this song.

The \"alien\" encounter the \"chosen one\" in the song is referring to is the band TOOL. Like the \"chosen one\" us TOOL fans have failed to deliver the message which TOOL has delivered to us. We are the chosen ones in that we have been chosen, by listening to their music, to pass on the band's message. I think this interpretation is absolutely dead right, esp. considering the fact that Maynard has said in several interviews that the album is meant to convey deep anger with the fact that no one has listened to what theyve said; they feel frustrated that so many people listen to their music but have no acted on what they have learned.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_175": "\nAlrighty then...\r\nSo far I agree with everyone, even those who are arguing with one another. It's the fact that so many different interpretations can be made from the one song/album that makes Tool & their work so freakin sweet! Anyway here's my interpretation:\r\n  So far the big debate is whether or not Dave (the guy in the song) is tripping balls or really did contact 'extra dimensional beings' but there is a third possibility i.e. he's gone insane. There's no doubt that Dave has had waaaaaaaay too much acid, a box of Krispy Kreme's worth if I'm not mistaken. The obliviousness of his situation i.e. not realising he's eaten acid laced donuts (a whole box worth OMGWTFBBQ!!112) explains why he doen't realise he's tripping and makes the trip even more mentally damaging.\r\n  Anyway back to my point, (if I ever had one) the section where E.T tells Dave that he is the 'Chosen One' who will deliver 'The Message' undoubtedly stands out in the track but there's more to this part than just aliens & drugs. When you consider the Messianic delusions that are common with Schizophrenia and the fine line between religion and madness in general, it seems that Dave's seemingly spiritual epxerience could be the result of him developing a full blown psychosis.\r\n  It is well known that some people who take enough acid can trip out so much that they don't come back to reality ever. Detatchement from reality is essentially what psychosis is so Dave has definately done some permanent damage to his noggin, even if he ever comes down.\r\n  Another interesting theory is that the song seems to have three distinct themes: Aliens/EDBs, hallucanigens and psychosis. This could correlate with the three scripts of the Rosetta Stone !WOW!\r\n  As for the LSD/DMT debate; Dave is on acid (among other things maybe) but if you add up the length of \"Lipan Conjuring\", \"Lost Keys\" and \"Rosetta Stoned\" it amounts to approximately 15 minutes. Hmm... Keep in mind that if you do listen to these tracks on DMT I won't be held responsible :P\r\n  Finally, shitting the bed seems to have more significance than just failure. They say that the last thing you do before you die is shit yourself (if you're packing that is.) The final part of the song conveys the feeling of shitting one's self (It did to me... ahem...) Anyway it's possible that Dave dies at the end of the song thus shitting himself at the last moment- end of song. This ties in to the the theme of death that the whole album conveys.\n\r\n  Don't forget your pen.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_176": "\nnonetospeakof has definitely come up with a good interpretation that makes sense. after listening to the song the first few times i thought that Maynard was being an arrogant smart-ass with the lines that start with 'overwhelmed at one would be...'

This thought is not purely based on lyric content but the way the music progresses - which is something that I believe people forget to pay attention to when they get lost finding quotes from the lyrics and using them to form logical conclusions like you would when analysing poetry. Also I get the vibe that it tries to portray the concept of when you go in too far and experience so much at once that it becomes very difficult to piece together the newfound discoveries of existance and what exactly occured in your journeys 'Can't remember what they said'. This type of effect I think is more likely to occur from trying to piece together the alien fizzle that DMT bombards you with.\n\r\nFor those who have done DMT before and have had an overally intense and hectic trip from it, you can probably relate to the line 'Can't breath right now...'\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_217": "\nSnowman_on_fire:\r\nVery well said\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_218": "\nI just now heard X, yoga DMT.\n\r\nI needed smoke a bunch of weed to heart, but i got it finally.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_219": "\nThe dude who posted these lyrics earlier than anyother site I've seen.

Terrence McKenna was a psychedelic who, like tool, saw a lot of wrong in the world and probably would agree with tool on many of their ideas on humanity. He said that if we are to save the earth we have to get back to nature first. He says only Mother Nature can bail us out of this mess we've gotten ourselves into. This guy does a lot of mushrooms and shit but he thinks that doing that gets you closer to nature and therefore closer to finding the answers to our problems. I think this song may reference some of his ideas. To me it's almost as if the character in this song got into contact with mother nature or something that can give him the details of earths ending so that he can come back and warn humanity and being the 'chosen one' he can try and make things right. Perhaps it's ironic that he forgets it all...It's almost as if tool are taking a dig at how the most important things in the world are often left to useless people i.e. George Bush being in control of the most powerful country in the world. I wouldn't put it past Maynard to inject some black ironic humour into this song. What do you guys think?

Even though LSD is never mentioned in the song, there are several clues that might lead one to believe that the song is about LSD. For one, the lyrics \"Blotter got right on top of me, got me seeing E-motherfucking-T!\" is directly related to LSD because it is a form of LSD...> \"blotter acid\"    also in the previous song \"lost keys(blame hofmann) they are talking about albert hofmann the inventor of lsd. the third and final reason i conclude this is that if you have ever done acid, which i have, you have this feeling of something else out there and can possibly have hallucinations of this.    In reference to DMT at the beginning of the song, i believe that DMT and LSD were combined causing a bad trip.. or possibly just a really  extreme trip.  < all of this makes it a very interesting song.. quiet amazing in fact..      anyway.. i think i have almost 100% correct lyrics  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n>>>>are the Chosen One, the One who will deliver the message.

This concept is utterly invalid. In fact, utilitizing drugs as a so called spiritual shortcut, has an adverse effect on spiritual development. These chemicals are a deterent, not a catalyst. Addiction and dependence are two very big steps backwards in the advancement of ones spiritual maturation, evolution, and development. Theres no way around the fact that the path to enlightenment requires meditation in order to climb to a higher level of self-awareness, coupled with the process of self-acceptance. The concept that drug experiences can lead to the uncovering of the singular answer to life is a fallacy. The concept is fundamentally unsound at its most basic level, simply because there is NO singular question being proposed here in our reality.\n\r\nEnlightenment is ethereal, and the path towards it is tedious and at times exasperating. The fact of the matter is that the application of self-discovery through deep self-examination, meditation, and internal reflection can never be supplemented by a simple chemical. The human consciousness is far to complex and magnificant. True enlightenment and awakening is more satisfy, I imagine, then the effects of a drug trip.\n\r\nBearing this in mind, we can begin to investigate the peice \"Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned\" by Tool.\n\r\nThe protaganist depicted here, who is clearly recalling a vivid acid trip, honestly believes that he himself was given the ultimate premonition...the end of humanity, by alien beings none the else. And Keenan, truly gifted as an awesome lyricist, adds insult to fallacy it seems, portraying the protaganist as having forgotten his pen at time of the alien visitation.\n\r\nThe \"chosen one\" here in \"Lost Keys/ Rosetta Stoned\" represents an entire generation of intellectual drug abusers under the misconception that chemicals can supplement real spiritual discipline. Ultimately, the \"stoned\" individual is a failure, dropping out of high school to pursue a life of drug abuse. And more saddening is the fact that he is ignorant to his own failure.\n\r\nKeenan drives this point home with the line, \"goddamn, shit the bed\"...a failure, a 'typical' failure.\n\r\nVery brilliant song. Sets the scene perfectly, but more importantly, stresses the need for individuals to become better aware that drug abuse is not the supplement for sober spiritual discovery.\n\r\nI can go on to say how this song is the antithesis to Third Eye but not here or now.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_268": "\npardon the poor spelling. =P\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_269": "\nS'all good R&R. one thing I will point out though is, although hallucinagens are in no way a shortcut to enlightenment, they can be a step towards it.

The Rosetta Stone was, as many posters have pointed out, a translation device that archaeologists and historians used to translate between ancient greek, latin, and hieroglyphics: a huge breakthough at the time. The fact that the song's speaker is \"Rosetta Stoned\" suggests that there is some huge breakthrough that needs to be communicated to the world, something that would synthesize a bunch of disparate understandings, but due to the way we have \"drugged\" ourselves in this modern world, we can't get the message across.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_280": "\n'Rosetta Stoned' could also be referring to the perception and resulting communication of one in an altered state.

I would say that the term \"Yogi DMT\" probably refers to a release of DMT via transcendental meditation.  Interestingly, the gland in the brain believed to secrete DMT is the Pineal gland.  the Pineal gland is biologically similar to our eyes in some respects, and is a key element of the seratonergic system of the human brain.  In some fish, the pineal gland is actually developed into a sensory organ very similar to a crude eye.   this is generally the scientific explanation for what many, including tool, might call the Third Eye.  Basically, \"prying open\" one's third eye (a la that song off Aenima) would be thus interpreted to be a DMT experience, while to many eastern philosophies this experience is NOT thought to be drug-induced but a natural part of existence.  Thus, the idea of this alien coming down as god to reveal one's nature as the chosen one is not entirely as ridiculous as many here seem to think, nor is it as elementary as a simple drug problem.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_282": "\nigreaves is a genius.

The scientists, in a separate control room, then caused different fluxuations in the magnetic fields generated by the helmet.

I do not claim to have a synthesis of this piece, only a collection of mostly strong opinions and theories. I welcome you to disprove anything and hope you do. *personal note that you can call ''an effort to support claims'' or you can chose to not be paranoid or out of being lazy skip over - SOMEONE WHO IS defInetly not me listened to this song on their come down of an ayahuasca trip during their 7th hour and it seemed to be a good illustration of how slow time was going for SOMEONE WHO IS defInetly not me .\n\r\nThings that are apparent to me:\r\n1.From the begining of the song to the end of the song there is the sence of 'coming down. Anyone who has had a time distorted experience can verify this. The fast talk/explanation in the begining is an overload of information and yet it's not studdered except for the obscure lyrics in the ''badadabadg bug eyes'' (which by the way reminds me of Finnegans Wake:First page, perenthetical and coinciding with ''The fall'') Anyway, Robert Anton Wilson (among Leary and others but I can't give reference to them) seems to be the proponent or supported of the idea of a Neurological Reality Tunnel, this is what you percieve. ''The nervous system receives over a billion signals every minute and the brain can't sort it out so it chooses some based on imprints and subconscious defences'' Not to ramble on too long he also believes among other 'mystics' that psychadelics can widen the tunnel of information that you brain can process. It makes sence to exclude any interpretation of a 'religious experience' or something about making fun of Ron L. or anyone else.  Further more he slows down during the whole song which is signal of his Reality Tunnel going back to normal or him ''coming down.'' I think this point has been pushed enough so on to...\n\r\n2. The similarities in tone and dynamics in the ''Then he looked right through me'' part and lipan conjuring. This is just a hunch but it makes sence because psychadelics (ESPECIALLY ayahuasca and mushrooms) are thought to be able to be very sound sensitive. What does that mean? Well simply it means you're very aware and can put your finger on a lot more of the gradients of glossalalia. Terence Mckenna talks about this in True Hallucinations in a more defined way. If you're having a skepticle time with this try mentally humming lipan conjuring and hum the 'waltzy' part of Rosetta; also take into account that he is still ''coming down'' and that you'll need to slow down to make a just comparison.\n\r\n3.This one is easier to tell in Live versions of the songs and this one is probably my favorite because trying to grab any meaning seems impossible sober. Ok, if you have seen a live version you know that his fast talk in the begining is complimented with a megaphone. I tried to catagorize content with when he is (not really but it's easy to understand) ''rambling'' and when he is using that beautiful voice of his. Something stuck out right away. When he talks in the megaphone almost everything he says is culturally defined and is punned. It's very rich in connatation. To my mind it's the Finnegans Wake of our generation. \n\r\nWhen he isn't talking out of the megaphone there are two implications I got thus far (and let me be first to get this completely wrong). One is that he seems to be washed of his ego-the cultural stronghold on his language (we all know what that means)- and he sounds like he's lost or just trying to do something nice for the world.  The second would be that when he's talking through the megaphone he is talking a changing his language for other people (rough interpretation of it) and when he isn't it's more to himself.\n\r\n''Don't even know what that means, must remember to write it down.'' This line is really the rosetta stone to me in this whole topic. ''Don't even know what that means'' has the tone and content that is pure, something that seems to me as egoless as he gets. And then what does he say? ''Must remember to write it down.'' The tone slopes down to the begining of the riff from a place of purity to the same person in for personal gain. \n\r\nLast thoughts:\r\nA beautiful song. Really this is my favorite song from Tool.  I would like to go back and for those who have tampered with Finnegans Wake keep in my what's said. I feel sympathy for him (and us dispite my lack of disposition) and his failure. And yet his failure is so common. Any experienced tripper or dreamer should be able to recall a time when they were close to the cusp of some answer that would change our view of reality. I really can't blame him for his lucky day dream. We all want answers and it appears to me that until we figure it out we will always be the orphan of a higher power and the brother to epistemology. My hope is for you to bust out laughing during a trip saying ''holy shit, that does make sence.'' with the help of what has been said. \n\r\nMy email is blumojo1@hotmail.com\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_327": "\ngreat ideas, many personal ideas could be expressed with this song, i hope i dnt repeat wats been said, my imput is on teh situation of the speaker,\r\ncould b about any significant experience/oportunity that pops up surprisingly out of the ordinary to our everyday lives, (a dream/vision of hope from our everyday normal existence etc) and to forget it would be frustating.

It seems like alot of the same old nonsense I'm hearing here.  It sounds like more of an attempt to assert the self up in here than it sounds like true discussion.  Here are some notions I have about Rosetta Stoned.  First off the first page I went to was page number eleven so much of my reaction will be taylored to what I heard there.  One of the reasons I clicked on eleven was because the chorus for rosetta stoned is in eleven groups of quarter notes (with a few manditory sextuplets for filler, etc) played as alternating six feel with a five feel.  When it comes to the elevens in the length of this song as well as Lipan Conjuring that could be a reference to the meter of rosetta stoned or more probably either a coincidence or a binary code that can't mean much (not that they could anyway)... and endless string of ones is not much differerent from the same in zeros -- without context.  As far as my interpretation of this song I think that this is Tool's experimentation into the 'lost keys' of rhythm.  Lipan Conjuring is about a minute long (close enough for humans) and a minute is sixty seconds.  The bridge (if you can call it that, there are no lyrics during the long section I'm thinking of) is sixty beats per repetition.  Danny plays the snare on every third beat and then starts over while he plays every five sixteenth notes on the kick while carrying steady tom beat. Also in this section if you count the reps starting with the one where Adam comes in with his guitar you get seven reps (plus the two prior) I'd like to believe that this is just to try to drive the point home about missing numbers.  Basically what I'm saying with this post is that this song is a panorama of metrical 'keys' and if there is a message it's just that it's just a bunch of sound over time - no message.  Words are just sound is what it amounts to (\"don't know, won't know).  Has anybody tried listening to the songs in the order of their meters?  Try this:  Intention (7), The Pot(8), Jambi(9), Vicarious(10), Right In Two(11), Wings (12) Rosetta Stoned(13) - this last one needs some explanation: Right after the break in the music towards the end, when it starts up again I believe Adam is playing in thirteen (lots of repeat notes and and stuff but I think that the overall rep is thirteen) and it explains why it's so confusing especially because Danny is once again playing his sixty count over it with maynard vocalizing on the fives with the kick drum.  So there's my sixty sense.  My onl.y last thought is that if any of you are like me then much of the time you barely agree with yourself most of the time and have thoughts conlictiing constantly.. Tool is a band of four people and I know that they have even more disagreements than one person could because of that.  I know Mayard writes almost all the lyrics but sometimes others step in the help right them.  Anyway it's just music I don't think political meaning of spiritual meaning or enthoegenic meaning or whateverthefuck will get you very far in trying to understand the music of Tool.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_387": "\nAlrighty then..\n\r\nI noticed a few connections to Aemina in this song.\r\n  At 6:00 Rosetta Stoned time there is a theme that sounds like a recurrent theme from H.  Also - 40 seceonds into H there is a theme that sounds like the theme at 2:00 in RS (this one is subtle).\r\n At 2:55 in Third Eye the driving guitar riff for much of the song comes in which sounds suspeciously like the riff that drives the chorus of Rosetta Stoned which makes its appearance at 2:58.\n\r\nI was smoked up one day and I listened to Rosetta Stoned and I was just thinking about what it reminded me of and then I heard the lyric \"Can't remember what they said\" and I found it humerous that I was trying to remember how the part went and when I was listening to third eye one day in my room I almost shit the bed when I finally connected the two guitar parts together.  I got another kick a few moments ago when I noticed that they both kick in at the same time in the song while I was looking up the time index.  It's almost like \"I do not recognize the vessel but the eyes seem so familiar\" is reflected in the perspective of the witness/victim in RS, although it's a stretch - I don't think that \"sominferous almond eyes\" are the same as eyes like \"phosphorescent desert buttons\".\n\r\nPersonal opinion time.\r\nI think you can blame Hoffman and other drug pioneers for the fact that mystical experiences that are given credibility seem scarce these days.  I wasn't around before there were so many drugs widely available and in common knowledge but I'll bet that if a person came to you and started telling a typical stoner story while they were totally distraught you'd have had more reason to believe them than you would now.  Think about the time of people that trip hard on drugs and why.  I'm not so much referring to stimulants like cocaine, tobacco, etc.. but DMT, Psilocybin, LSD.  The hals take a different type of appreciation than just a good physical feeling.  Many of the hardcore trippers are probably the same people that would've fasted for days on end back in the day to elicit a certain awareness.  Most of the people I'm talking about don't have families to worry about, maybe they aren't good with people.  Maybe they are very close to a sacred piece of knowledge but they just can't quite get it without going through some drastic measures.  People used to listen to dreams more often and people also paid more attention to stories people told.  Sometimes it isn't even important that the story be true (by conventional standards) it could still carry a message.\r\nOn the bright side.  Perhaps most of the stories you heard about divine revelation and all that from back in the day were merely the ravings of people who needed good drugs for their psychosis (or whatever the current medical term is for somebody who's sober but out of his mind) or maybe just good advice from somebody telling them that they picked the wrong mushrooms to go in the soup.\r\nI also think that this song is sort of a gift to the fans.  Especially all the fans that tripped so hard over their albums and at their shows.  For classic tool material comparable to third eye and other trippy tunes this one has it all.  It's almost as if the fans themselves wrote some of it.  That's just to say that I don't think this song carries any message personal to Maynard (even if he's 'been there').  It's a wonderful piece of music especially for fans of rhythm and unusual narrative styles.  It's also a good song to listen to if you've never tripped but want to hear something typical for that kind of experience.\n\r\nPS:  I listened to this song last halloween on my first acid trip and it was... absolutely sublime, funny, groovy (I was freaking out in my bed to the grooves - I couldn't stop moving, it was too awesome) and it sounds sooooo smooth, especially the way the effects are layered to obscure which intrument is creating the sound, like that part early on where something is saying to the patient \"shit the bed\" maybe it's just his body telling him what's about to happen but then he cries out \"You better listen!\" and drowns it out.  No wonder he shit the bed - he wouldn't listen.  That just further supports my belief that the lyrics as a societal issue aren't the key here.  All this even though I had already been totally familiar with the song before that trip.  So listen to it sober or stoned but you better listen.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_388": "\ni dont suppose i can even begin to offer the extent of insite that some have shown in their comments. however i think it's impotant to realize the obvious and various psychadelic influences. i don't see how any can say it isn't about DMT or isn't about acid. It obviously is. More importantly, maybe is the combination. 4 hours (10-2am) is typical (at least) for several hallucinogenic trips and Extacy, DMT, and LSD are mentioned directly.

To do this, she goes to a club/rave/party where she knows there will be drugs, thinking that drug-use and the counterculture are a means of finding the meaning of life.\r\nIn reality, she was drugged with multiple psychedelics (and later sedatives) by a man at the party. She was then raped by the man.\r\nShe however, thought she was being abducted by space aliens. Her whole experience is told as if it were a telivsion show/movie. She becomes psychotic after the incident, and is put in a mental hospital while she is under the belief that she is the chosen one.\n\r\nMoral: Television has misled most of us into believing a false reality. A lot of people are under the belief that using drugs will lead to creativity, when really the na\u00efve use of drugs could end up getting a person raped or make a person psychotic.

Incorporating the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cstoned\u00e2\u0080\u009d into this implies that our modern communication is distorted as if it were \u00e2\u0080\u009cstoned\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or high on weed.

Stoned also has a double meaning in the fact that she was drugged up.\n\r\n- A lot of people believe that the only way to decipher what the meaning of life is, is by using drugs.

The narrator did multiple drugs at the club/party. Then the narrator went outside the club/party, hence the \"just outside of Area 51\". His/her \"need to know pose\" is his way of saying that he was thinking deeply and philosophically, or trying to pose like he/she was an intellectual.\n\r\nThere are a few different ways to interpret the use of the term \"Area 51\"\r\n1. He/she considers everyone at the club/party to be different than him, like an alien.\r\n2. He/she thinks that the club/party is where abnormal people (\"aliens\") are kept in hiding from society.\r\n3. \"Area 51\" is where he/she is heading to. A place where the unknown and large-scale secrets are located. He/she is pursuing the meaning of life.\n\r\n\"contemplating the whole chosen people thingy \"\r\nSimple enough. He is thinking deeply about \"chosen people\" and saviors. A different interpretation (which I wouldn't support as much) is that he is referring to the nation of Israel \"God's chosen people\", which is stuck in a heated conflict of religion which biblically indicates the apocalypse.\n\r\n\"when just then a flaming stealth banana split the sky like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this. Cutting right angle donuts on a dime and stopping right at my birkinstocks, and me yelping 'holy fucking shit!'\"\n\r\n1. The drugs are kicking in. He wasn't expecting it to be this powerful.\r\n2. He finds a drug dealer who has high-grade psychedelics (LSD)\r\n3. A Nuclear weapon just went off \"flaming stealth banana split the sky\". People hoped that a nuclear weapon would have been detonated in another nation, but they weren't expecting one to go off in their own nation. The explosion got very close to him \"stopping right at my birkenstocks\", or maybe he actually did die and is unaware of it. The words \"holy fucking shit\" might be significant. \"Holy\" could be referring to religion, and how it is going to \"fuck us over\".\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthen the X file being,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009calien\u00e2\u0080\u009d that landed. Or perhaps an ecstacy dealer.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009clooking like some kinda blue green Jackie chan,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThe drug dealer looks like he is sick (blue-green), or an unappealing person. Or perhaps he is describing the \u00e2\u0080\u009calien\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d appearance.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith Isabella Rossellini lips, and breath that reeked of vanilla chig champa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThe drug dealer may not be visually appealing, but he is attracted to what the drug dealer tells him. The drug dealer probably tells him that he has acid or some other psychedelic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNag champa\u00e2\u0080\u009d is an inscent often used by stoners. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChigs\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a fictional race of aliens. So the drug dealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breath smelled strongly of  \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrippy space-inscents\u00e2\u0080\u009d which may imply that he smelled some type of drug (maybe weed) on the drug dealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breath.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdid a slow mo matrix descent outta the butt end of the banana vessel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nPossibly, the drug dealer had just gotten out of a yellow volkswagon bus (\u00e2\u0080\u009cbanana vessel\u00e2\u0080\u009d) which are known for being drove by hippies.\n\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand hovered above my bug eyes, my gaping jaw, and my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip and all I could think was, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I hope uncle martin here doesn't notice that I pissed my fuckin pants!!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nHe is perplexed and awed by the drug dealer. This part makes me begin to think the narrator is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cregular joe working man\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and he is seeing the drug-culture for the first time. Perhaps the narrator only knows what he sees on TV, this would explain the constant movie/television references.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cso light in his way, like an apparition, that he had me crying out...\r\n\"fuck me! It's gotta be the dead head chemistry. (the) blotter got right on top o' me. Got me seeing E mutha fuckin T!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThe acid and/or other drugs that he took is making him freak out. Now he sees someone who he refers to as ET. Now, ET is automatically and humorously assumed to be the alien from the movie ET. But what could ET stand for? Of course, extra-terrestrial is a given, but I think it stands for EnterTainment. Or, television. Perhaps he tries to watch some entertainment on television to calm himself down. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cFuck Me\u00e2\u0080\u009d might imply that ecstacy is making the narrator horny.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cand after calming me down with some orange slices and some fetal spooning, E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose. He said. \"you are the chosen one. The one who will deliver the message. A message of hope for those who choose to hear it, and a warning for those who do not.\" Me! The chosen one. They chose me!!!! And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThis is indeed the most interesting section of the song lyric-wise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cET\u00e2\u0080\u009d calmed the narrator down with candy (orange slices) which possibly means sedatives like valium/xanax/rohypnol, and then had sex with the narrator (fetal spooning). Since the gender of the narrator is not specified, this makes another possible conclusion of the song to be about a girl getting seduced with drugs at a club/party and getting raped. Possibly ET is a cult leader who tells her that she is the chosen one to try and hide the fact that he raped her. The girl is possibly manic, which the drugs might have brought out, and she now things she is the chosen one.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen he looked right through me with somniferous almond eyes. Don't even know what that means. Must remember to write it down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nHe then gives her more drugs to make her pass out \u00e2\u0080\u009csomniferous almond eyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d. She is still wrapped up in the concept of being the chosen one, and is going to write down what is going on in her mind. A lot of psychedelic users try to write down what is going on in their mind during an experience.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is so real. Like the time Dave floated away. See, my heart is pounding. cuz this shit never happens to me.\r\nCan't breathe right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nDave floated away is possibly a reference to David Garza who wrote the song \u00e2\u0080\u009cFloat Away\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t breathe right now\u00e2\u0080\u009d She is panicking, or possibly her respiration has gotten so low from all the sedatives she had been dosed with that she is starting to die.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was so real. Like I woke up in wonderland. all sorta terrifying. I don't wanna be alone while I tell this story.\r\nAnd can anyone tell me why y'all sound like peanuts parents?\r\nWill I ever be coming down?\r\nThis is so real. Finally it's my lucky day See, my heart is racing cuz this shit never happens to me.\r\nCan't breathe right now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThis is after the whole event had happen, possibly the next day. She is now psychotic. She has lost touch with reality and everyone sounds like \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeanuts parents\u00e2\u0080\u009d. She is very panicky, and possibly has developed PTSD.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou believe me don't you? Please believe what I've just said. See, the dead ain't touring and this wasn't all in my head. see they took me by the hand and invited me right in. then they showed me something. I don't even know where to begin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nShe is probably telling people (maybe her parents) about her alien/chosen one story and they obviously do not believe her.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStrapped down to my bed, feet cold and eyes red.\r\nI'm out of my head am I alive?

Shit the bed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nWatching TV no longer entertains her anymore. Sudafed Gyro Scopes might be referring to a meth-pipe, which could mean that she tried taking meth to make herself functional again but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work.

Kinda seems like hes joking around with the seriousness of the whole 'why are we here'.. i know that ive gotten back heavily into yoga again becase of tool.. they speak about much more than is just 'mentioned' the meanings are reflected and refracted..and it takes a much broader mind to see what tool hints at. A broader mind i think i try to achieve everyday.\n\r\nthank you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_458": "\nWhat I think:\n\r\nMaynard always has the lyrics of songs tie together in their albums.  And the last three songs (excluding triad) Rosetta Stoned, Intension, Right in Two, seems to be a critique of humanity to me.  So I tend to believe this is more based on humanity's shortcommings rather than drug abuse (drug abuse could be considered one I suppose but this is more important than just that).  \n\r\nRosetta Stone is a program to help people learn new languages so I think this character in this song got 'stoned' from hearing a new 'language' which in this case was the aliens' form of communication.  And by stoned I don't mean good times and laughter I mean his mind got completely thrown in the gutter and he can no longer think straight because of what he was shown.  Because the alien form of communicating is completely beyond the capabilities of a human mind and he was reduced to a babaling idiot and is now therefore in a hospital.  Pleading with people \"You believe me, don't you? \r\nPlease believe what I just said\".  And not comprehending people \"And can anyone tell me why \r\nY'all sound like Peanuts parents?\"\n\r\nIf I remember correctly the tone and pace of the lyrics changes from before the lyrics \"You'd better. You'd better. You'd better. You'd better listen\" where it was fast paced and detailed, and then those lyrics came, whether they are the characters words or the aliens, and then after that the message is delivered (\"Then he looked right through me\"), all sane thoughts are lost to the wind and for the most part the speech is slower (easier to understand anyway) where the persons mind is not as detailed as it used to be and more aloof.  \n\r\nI think his reference to \"But I forgot my pen\" was the characters last sane thought before he was shown, whatever it was he was shown.  Thinking to himself almost jokingly, 'i need to record this but i dont have my pen...*blam*'\n\r\nSo from here I venture from things which are shown in the lyrics to what I believe is the purpose of the song.  Like I said earlier, near the end of the album it becomes more evident of describing the faults of humanity, and i think this song is just to show how pathetic our minds really are.  For instance, compare our minds to an ant.  Each indivual ant has a job or purpose, and ways of going about that purpose, they also have problems which impede them and rewards from achieving goals (the prosperity of the hive).  Now compare the ants lives to us, we (humans) are probably unknown objects to them, natural phenomena* if you will.  If an ant was shown one shred of our consicousness I believe that ant's mind would probably be overwhelmed.  Even if we were just trying to warn it of a flood coming and what would be the \"The details of [their] ending.\"  So, for the sake of argument put ourselves in the position of the ants and the humans are the aliens.  I now believe you can see where I am coming from where the person would be \"Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in [his] position\", brain dead and unable to keep control of his simple bodily funtions (taking a shit when he is supposed to).\n\r\nSo for all of our overwhelming and vital problems we are really not that important.  Quite pathetic actually.  And as a side note I think it can be derived that, the thought that we even think we understand the smallest bit of a higher intelligence's intention or reason, whether it be a god or an alien species, is purly arrogant.\n\r\nI kinda think I am biased with this since I am big into sci-fi so my imagination can wander in this direction but I don't see that as a bad thing.\n\n\n\r\nSo I think you guys can understand where I am coming from with all of this, I understand that the vocals for Tool always have multiple levels and different ways of looking at it, which is one thing that makes their music art instead of just the pointles babling we here most of the time today.  So I think there is no 'right' interpretation to the song, only your interpretation.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_459": "\nI think Dragonfly Key got it right.

I usually listen to a Tool album a few times before I pass any judgment. The bottom line is that Tool is a talented band and so their works should be appreciated. To me Rosetta Stoned is, in a sense, a way for them to express their unique sounds without the background noise of mainstream subjects/sounds. As to what they're trying to convey I can only surmise it has something to do with the desensitization to both what is sacred and what is feared. In our media-controlled society sanctity of life and also fear of death are two sides of consciousness that are completely undermined. I see this song as a way for a very talented and open minded band to express the feelings that accompany dehumanization (ET symbolism), and censorship, etc. Sorry for this lengthy comment, I literally started this account just so I could comment on this one song.

I'm sure that it is about DMT, death, moms, and poop. That's all pretty obvious. The question to ask is better put as, \"why did tool write this song?\" Tool wrote this song to make money, to express unexplored/repressed levels of consciousness in the mainstream. However, it should be noted that Tool has explored in depth the mysteries of the 'Priory of Sion,' (holy blood holy grail was on their recommended reading list) and Rennes Le Chateau (Undertow was written in Southern France). The true composition of death and the philosopher's stone is on dissectional.com. After nearly 20 years I think that the Band just decided to summarize all of their hard-earned knowledge in a fun multifaceted song such as Rosetta Stoned. This song is definitely about what is really behind Christianity and how sometimes you might not like 'opening your eye.'

Any decent musician or writer knows you don't draw off one perspective to write a story, so why do you belittle TOOL by claiming you \"get it.\" Trust me you don't, I don't, even Maynard probably doesn't \"get it\".

Maynard also spent half the show baa ing at the audience basically implying they were sheep which I thought was pretty funny.

L ROn Hubbard believed that he was the one who had been selected to tell humanity the 'truth' about our origins and our ultimate ending, and the basis of the beliefs of scientology are that humans are, in a nutshell, the reincarnated souls of aliens that were killed millions of years ago. WHere this fits in with the song is, first off, the UFO references, the 'stealth bananna', area 51, etc. The person in the song was visited by an 'x-files being' and revealed to that he is the chosen one to deliver the message to humanity (as l ron hubbard believed he was chosen) and all the references to being high are maynards way of saying that there's NO way hubbard came up with all of this and seriously believes it, unless of course, he was high.
