{"comment_0": "\nI really don't know but...I relate to this song. It's a girl living fast but wants the best, you know,  a good relationship with a good man. But she's a bit damaged. She's trying her best, but us girls who have big personalities an love smoking and drinking have a hard time.It's hard to get over being hard. You want love but you aren't sure. You're weary of promises and emotions because you know better. I'm a traveler who doesn't know how to stay, and i think I'm chasing love and home, but I'm not there yet. Thank you to Miranda who has made this real. I feel like her. I want those things, but i don't want them at the expense of myself\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\n\"I'm going north on 59 but I know good and well I'm headed south\n'Cause me and Birmingham don't have a history of working out\n\nWhat I lost in Louisiana I found back in Alabama\nBut nobody ever taught me how to stay\nIt ain't love that I'm chasin' but I'm runnin' just in case\"\n\nI believe she is singing about how she doesn't expect her relationship with Anderson East to last (he's originally from Alabama). In the end it didn't, self fulfilling profecy?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
