{"comment_0": "\nI have been reading about the true self which is how we are when we are born and we are supposed to be free and happy but we get told not to do things,told to do things we dont want, smacked, judged, controlled, shamed for being alive. The shame remains inside the brain/body having learned from parents and school and it becomes automatic, judging and controlling us from the inside. 'It' learns do do things to avoid abandonment from parents and the true self underneath is constantly screaming to reconnect with us, which is the fear we feel, so we drink, smoke, party, distract ourselves from the true self fearing the shame but wanting to reconnect. It is like having a small child and constantly ignoring it and or abusing it and it is screaming and you cant stand the noise and distract yourself. All it wants is love and no more shame and this conflict is going on in our minds unconsciously. On the surface we have cravings,copulsiveness and addictions that seem to have no reason to be there. I think what they call the ego is a screaming frightened and abandoned energy reacting to inner and outer shame. It's emotions and energy are constantly being suppressed and drugs are a powerful way to release it by force. If we can do what we truly want without any fear or judgement and notice when we feel shame from within and the feelings that come with it we will feel happy without needing anything from out there. There is a cure from all this dysfunction, that is all it is! :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI think this song about dealing with an addiction, perhaps an alochol addiction considering that Metallia was once called Alochollica.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nuhh... since I once heard James Hetfield say that this song is about addiction, that is what I'm going to go with here. If anyone here has had the unfortunate experience of dealing with addiction you could see where it would make sense. Those of you who interpret the song as being about evil aren't far off as being addicted to drugs and/or alcohol is a bitch and sometimes leads people to do things they wouldn't ordinarily do. \r\nthe lines \"I'm your life, I'm the one who takes you there....I'm the one who cares....do my dirty work scape goat......pay the price, pay for nothings fair.\"  really work for the addiction scenario.  The sad fact is that you can turn your back on your friends and family but you can't turn your back on a drug.

This strategy was meant to replace the bloody armed revolution preached by Karl Marx in the Communist Manifest of 1838. Gramsci's idea was that, intead of the blunt, violent approach that was taken in the Russian Revolution of 1917, Cuban revolution of Fidel Castro or Chinese revolution of Mao Tse Tung amongst others, they should quietly and progressively infiltrate their ideas and philosophy into the mass culture: Starting with universities, arts in general (film, music), press, media, anything that would provide a channel to spread their ideas to the masses, but in a discrete, not obvious way.\n\nWith that strategy, with decades of work, they would  (As some believe they succeeded in) have \"soldiers\" everywhere, fighting and defending the socialist ideals sometimes without even knowing where those ideals came from. In a form of mind control or brain wash, so to speak. \n\nSo, if you listen to the verses of the song again, now assuming that the words are spoken by this \"entity\" , which would be socialism itself, or populism, if you may, this philosophic shadow  personified, or maybe Antonio Gramsci himself, which dictates what we all think and do. Making us do terrible things (the dirty work) in it's name, making us take the blame (We are the ones who are shamed) and fight instead of him (we are scapegoats). In the end the entity reveals itself: \n\n\" I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m your truth, telling lies ( One of the main strategies preached by Gramsci is to lie)\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m your reasoned, alibis (to do and defend the bad things in name of Socialism)\nI'm Inside, open your eyes  (hey, wake up you idiot, I'm inside you all this time )\nI'm YOU! \"  ( the ideology has completely taken over the person's thoughts and actions)\n\nIt gives me goose bumps.

It is possible that drug use could be involved, but that would be due to his inner demons (which we all have) or that inner voice that gives us that \"fuck you\" attitude, telling us what we WANT to hear, do, or say. Not what we NEED to be informed. Whether that attitude is only a thought or an action, it is still regarding to that little bit of yourself telling you (the bad option) is okay.\r\nI is also written in a fairly open idea that can be applied to peoples' related experiences.

A long time ago in school I used this song in a music class that had a song meaning academic, and I chose this song because it has the perfect interface for being misunderstood. \n\r\nAs with most of Metallica's songs, they have a deep story behind what is actually being sung.

I have watched a lot of videos and read articles and whatnot about Metallica considering the Black Album and this song is not about addiction, I mean I agree to a degree that its about addiction but not in the way everyone is thinking. This song is about religion and how it poisons your mind and beliefs to take over your opinions and ideologies of your life. The line 'I'm inside open your eyes, I'm you' validates that. James Hetfield grew up in a very religious family and his mother died because of a lack of medical treatment due to religion so a lot of that trauma is placed into their songs and lyrics.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_135": "\nCould be about schizophrenia if you think about it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_136": "\nIm in recovery for poly-drug addiction as well as human trafficking.

Ego leads you through your life until you discover it exists, the way it operates, and find out that your ego is not you. I've discovered it after reading Eckhart Tolle's \"A New Earth\", which describes mechanics of ego besides other spiritual stuff. At the same time, Metallica's song Sad but True became understandable like never before.\n\nEgo survives by pretending to be you (\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m your life\u00e2\u0080\u009d) and keeping you out of being aware of it. Furthermore, stories in your mind about others betraying you and other judgments empower ego through feeling of separateness from others. Ego pretends to be \"the one who cares\", but it actually only cares about its own survival. You are only its \"mask, cover, shelter\". Ego also feeds itself on the belief that without it and separation between \"me\" and others you are not real, so it \"makes you real\". If you go through life with ego being your eyes, you'll live in \"your dream\" created by ego and not really living. \n\nYour ego pushes you to do whatever it thinks it will make it grow more, even bad things, just to enhance itself and separateness from others. You are just its \"scapegoat\" who does his \"dirty work\". Then it judges your doings through its eyes (when you must steal)\". \n\nYour ego seeks admiration and love from others. It can never get those from others fully, so it makes you feeling hate because of that - \"hate when you want love\" - and you \"pay the price\" by feeling negative emotions, pain. \n\nWhen your ego has grown too much and became too arrogant, it stops caring (\"I no longer care\"), even about being discovered and destroyed. It can even afford to tease you to \"come inside and open your eyes\". It doesn't care at all, so it's free to impose great suffering on you. Under a great suffering, you start questioning yourself, \"looing inside and opening your eyes\" and finally see the ego inside you. It says \"I'm you\", but it can't trick you anymore. The mere fact that there's a separation in that sentence between I and you signals that you are aware that the ego exists as something other than you. Otherwise, the end would have been just \"I am.\" So the song ends with your ego being discovered in light of awareness / consciousness. Ego can't live in presence of consciousness, so it dissolves and you are finally becoming free. Or, you can still live your \"dream\" through your ego's eyes, always judging and complaining about the world and people, just like the man in My Friend of Misery. And spend the whole life without knowing the truth. Just like the man in the Unforgiven song. But even he at the end takes a look back and realizes the truth.\n\nIt's incredible how I previously had thought this song is so depressive, but now it appears so positive, since consciousness wins. Sooner or later.\n\nAlso, it looks like those who understand this song as about being about addiction are right. Ego survives by you being addicted to your thoughts. Once the addiction is gone by being aware / conscious of your thoughts, you're free.\n\nSorry about bad text formatting in the previous version of the same comment.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_140": "\nWhy does song facts insist that this song is about \"blind faith in religion\"?\n\nNormally that site, mentions some interview where the band explains the song; but this song was really never explained.\n\nSo I have no idea what this song is about.
