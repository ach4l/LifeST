{"comment_0": "\nEver had that one person that you felt you could never live without? Even go as far as to call them your \"other half\"? That's how I feel whenever I listen to this song. You're so attached and you never want to let go. But than they leave you, and you don't feel like trying (or living) anymore. Even when they leave and you know they'll be back, you hate it because they're not with you anymore, until next time. You give your everything in the relationship, but they don't give anything back or they just leave.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
