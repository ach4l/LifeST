{"comment_0": "\nThe song isbased on the personal experience of Doc Pomus (he wrote the song), who had polio and used crutches to get around and could not dance. His wife, however, was a Broadway actress and dancer. The song gives his perspective of plaintively telling his wife to have fun dancing, but reminds her who will be taking her home and \"in whose arms you're gonna be.\" \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nthis is such a fun song :).  \n\r\nbasically, a guy is comfortable with the fact this his girl may dance with other guys because he knows that for the last dance, she'll be with him.\n\r\nand she'll be going home with him :).\n\r\ndefinitely going to be the last song played at my wedding reception.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song is adorable.. not only can I dance to it, but it makes me happy.. the lyrics are so cute.. because the guy knows that the girl will dance with him no matter with how many guys she might dance with =)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nCheerful, upbeat song with a lyric that actually means something deeper.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nLove this song.\r\nIts just so catchy, and the meaning is pretty obvious.\r\nOne alteration though. Its actually \"beneath the pale moon light\" not \"candle light\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nLove this song. It's so fun, cute and very catchy. It makes you in a good mood, and you can't stop smilling when you hear it. So good :p\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nYou could almost picture a dad singing this to his daughter.  I love it! Such a sweet song =)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nthis is such a great song! is it just me or does Michel Buble remind anyone of frank senatra? like his voice and his classiness\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
