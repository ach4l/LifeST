The pieces are now corrupt, molded shadows of the once great temple.  This song says if the pieces don't communicate with each other than we are doomed.  At least, that is what I hear.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI have to agree with a lot of what everyone has said... the main fact I HAVE to agree with is that Maynard incorporates so many different meanings into his songs that almost anyone who makes an interpretation is correct, because he makes the music, and expects people to make their own interpretation and apply it to their own personal life... however i'll just tell it the way I see it, which is probably far from the truth, but it's my own personal truth.\n\r\nFor a long time I considered this song from the relationship stand point.  I still see the strong arguements made to the relationship testament in this song... it very well could deal with 2 depleted lovers... and how although once the pieces were all there, yet after losing everything they had and breaking into those \"pieces\", he wishes to re-find them... bring them back together... I mean that can even be seen in the video (but I'll make a different point on the video later) where in the end they come together, reforming the one... which is what i believe a relationship does.  It takes 2 people and forms them into 1 body... \n\r\nBut that's not even what this interpretation is about... after a long time of pondering over it, I've come to realize I think the song is about the religious aspect of it all... there are a lot of Tool songs that deal with religion... so... here goes nothin.\n\r\nOkay, the hardest area for me to cover is who the song seems to be coming from... I don't feel that Maynard meant for this to seem as if it's coming from his mouth... maybe these words are meant to be from Christ? but my best feeling is that the words are simply from any believer who can realize what has happened to \"faith\" because of the blunder known as \"religion\"...\n\r\nAt one time, the \"church\" was one body.  It was a singular unit, set on one system of beliefs that everyone who had faith followed... there was none of this \"denomination\" shit...\r\n\"I know the pieces fit, cuz i watched them fall away\" (saying that he knows religion should be one body, even though it's not. he's seen the separations)\r\n\"Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing\" (rotten and burned up, to put it into different terms... when he says fundamental differing, i think he's showing the basis for the break... that from the very FUNDAMENTALS of the belief structure, there started to be DIFFERING feelings among people, and how they wanted to express them)\r\n\"Pure Intention juxtaposed will set 2 lovers souls in motion\" (meaning that although the intentions every time were pure, they were juxtaposed, or twised, and because of that, it sat 2 lovers [of Christ] into almost a square off to see who could be MORE correct)\r\n\"Distentigrating as it goes, testing our communication\" (simply saying the square off was what orignially caused the separation into pieces, and it caused a lack of discussion)\r\n\"The light that fueled the fire then has burned a hole between us so we cannot see to reach an end, crippling our communication\" (the light of passion that originally fueled our fire [love] for Christ is what, in the end, tore us apart and burned a hole between us... it's caused the end of the communication as well)\r\n\"I know the pieces fit cuz i watched them tumble down. No fault, none to blame, that doesn't mean I don't desire to point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over bring the pieces back together, rediscover communcation\" (I think here the meaning is that although no one is directly to blame for this break, because every \"piece\" that was broken was done in the name of righteousness.  Still, he thinks he's right, so he wants to be able to point the finger, say the OTHER was wrong. Yet still he wants to see the separate temples topple over, and the pieces brought back together, so they can reunite under one belief system.\"\n\r\nI know the end of that last interpretation was a bit shaky, because i say that the meaning of the \"temple toppling over\" was the separate temples, so they could be reunited... but i think my theory is backed up in the next paragraph.\n\r\n\"The poetry that comes from the squaring off between, and the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance\" (although the separation needs to end, the writer is saying that the separation NEEDED to happen... because the church split, and each went it's own direction, the poetry [writings, findings, ideals] that came from the separation, and the fighting was worth it.  It brings new truths back to the faith, thus strengthening it.)\n\r\nThe next paragraph just restates the others... that the whole was broken into the \"pieces\" due to the fighting and coveting.  The writer knows that they MUST return together. otherwise the separate pieces will fall.  They must grow, and strengthen, and reunite.\n\r\nAt the end, Maynard says \"Cold silence had a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion between supposed lovers\".... I think what he's saying is that the breaks have cause us to lose true LOVE for our counterparts (the other pieces)... and we're SUPPOSED to be lovers of Christ, or the one true god (whatever your belief states that that is)... but how can we be if we can't even get along with our fellow believers?\n\r\nOkay, to wrap this all up... I'll refer to the video one more time... although it can be seen as 2 separate people becoming one, i believe it's the \"church\" reforming into one unit... I mean notice what happens to the 2 separated people [who represent \"denominations\"]... they almost seem to be trying to outdo the other.  I mean one even stands on his head during the song.  It seems they're trying to show that they're the BETTER group (which you can't deny happens today). Yet in the end, the 2 come together, reforming the one true body...\n\r\nThanks for reading my entirely too long interpretation... I know a lot of what I've said isn't right, but I like to believe that my belief is pretty close.  However, once again, Tool's music is meant for you to make your OWN interpretation, so you can apply it to your own life... Once again, sorry this is so long (as are all of my other interpretations).

Maynard, the singer and song writer of Tool, incorporates so many different meanings into his songs that almost anyone who makes an interpretation is correct, because he makes the music and expects people to make their own interpretation and apply it to their own personal life; however i'll just tell it the way I see it, which is probably far from the true meaning, but it's my own personal opinion about the meaning of the song \"Schism\".\r\n\tFor awhile I considered this song from the relationship stand point.

Schism, the song and video refer to the [i]schism[i/] that separated man from woman and source(god, prime creator, the light) 300,000 years ago by human beings' \"extraterrestrial\" ancestors (not the ones whom meant humans well). The \"aliens\" in the video are who [i]humans used to be[/i], and their subsequent confusion after that separation. The reference to the [i]juxtaposition[/i] (which was original 'human' form, [b]everything as one[/b]), is about the separation of the [i]sacred geometry[/i] that exists in each human's body (ie: the reference to the squaring off and circling.) The light refers to the light from which the human race came, or prime creator, which humans have been separated from because of the ones that took control over the human race. The [i]sacred geometry[/i] which exists in the human body went through [b]schism[/b], thus separating humans from the light. However, when the pieces are put back together in alignment, then humans are back to their original form...the light. \n\"Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.\", refers to the way humans blame one another for their problems, difficulties and oppression. However, humans are not to blame other humans as it is not humans who cause these problems. Humans have been separated to think they are different in order to be more easily controlled. The temple (human existence and temporal bodies) will topple over (cease to exist) if humans continue to point the finger at one another.\nMaynard and Keenen realize their origin because of \"There was a time that the pieces fit, but [i]I watched them fall away[/i].\"\nThese lyrics:\"I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing.

This song can mean many things. I believe it has to de with evolution, but at the same time I took a dream class and in the class we learned about the true story of Adam and eve, not the religious one.. The ancient one, the real first story before it became religious. In the song at the end the female and male come together, in the real story of adam and eve they were not people. They were both a concious. \r\nThe Anima is the personification of all feminine psychological tendencies within a man, the archetypal feminine symbolism within a man's unconscious. The Animus is the personification of all masculine psychological tendencies within a woman, the archetypal masculine symbolism within a woman's unconscious. One might look on the concept of anima-animus as a kind of yin/yang solution to the duality of human sexuality. They are products of the long human experience of man with woman and woman with man: as man has opened to his feminine nature, so has woman a corresponding male side. They also act as collective images which motivate each sex to respond to and understand members of the other gender. That is, a man apprehends the nature of woman by virtue of his hidden anima,  and reciprocating, the woman is able to grasp the nature of male. \n\r\nReally both conscious were as one. Thats just one side to look at it. That religion has also separated us physically and mentally.  Also another reason why woman are looked frowned upon because eve did eat the apple. However the snake is a circle of like and without the snake and the apple we wouldn't be able to live on.

I've read a lot of interpretation about this song... granted I know I'm a few years to late in posting my thoughts on it.... This song is really the back bone of the albums story. You will find a story in all of tools albums. The story of this album is about evolving into a higher being. Sort of a continuation to AEnima. Close to the end of the last album everything was destroyed. More so specified L.A as Maynard was wishing it was going to happen. Lets assume that it did happen and most of the world did get flushed away.\n\r\nIt's been my experience that humans have a small sense of evolution during a natural disaster they seem to  co-operate and be more compassionate to one another.(I know I'm detouring from the song at hand but I do have a point so bear with me) People start off angry that something like this happens. They have a grudge against \"insert name of your beloved divine power here\" Lets call it for the sake of argument \"God\" call it what you will. As time progresses we tend to forget ourselves and that we are mortal and very human. We no longer communicate with one another as if we lost all sense of compassion for the next person. So in order to communicate it will have to be as a collective as one being. Though the human race is not ready to see or communicate world collectively so as we evolve we tend to fall into pieces. Therefore, we try to put those pieces back together. We hold a grudge with each other and point the finger blame the other for our lack of evolution when we should only be blaming ourselves as an individual for slowing down our evolution and forgetting to communicate. It is said the key to any relationship is communication. So we need to embrace the reality of it all and collectively communicate to each other so we can live in perfect flowing spiral of our own divinity. \n\r\nSo my point is we evolve and reach a schism or fall to a mess of pieces and try to put it all back together.\n\r\nThat's just my point of view of the song and album. Granted there a million different reasons to interpret this song.

This could mean so many things to so many people and I personally think that is one of the purposes of their songs. \nAlthough I can see religious and humanity elements in this, I actually think this song is about the band itself. The Lateralus album was released 5 years after AEinma, where the band had been through not only a personnel change (Justin replacing Paul D'Amour) but also a lengthy court battle and MJK doing his thing with A Perfect Circle. What this says to me is that Tool knew they could create together because the pieces had fit previously, but had they now broken down,become divided, between supposed brothers? It took strength and communication to bring them back together, stronger, determined and the Lateralus album was the child of that pain, growth and subsequent love of being together.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_29": "\nIt's clearly about a relationship dissolving through lack of communication and compassion.

You would sooner find the exact meaning behind Dali's persistence of memory. The meaning I get about this song has nothing to do with religion, or politics. \n\nWhat can be said about this song is what it says about humanity. Through our fear of being wrong we try our hardest to make our position heard, and through fear of being wrong, and having to cope with the fact that we may have been wrong all our lives, we are unwilling to deviate from our own path we have chosen whether its the right path or not. and this is true for every person who has ever thought the way they are doing something is the only way one should do it. \n\nThrough communication we can learn about each others paths through life, but without communication we look upon the actions of another with confusion and fear, not knowing, and in some cases not wanting to know why this person would merit such strange actions. Through fear, suspicion and misunderstanding we have grown apart from each other. and only through reestablishing our understanding of one another can we truly be as a whole once again as nature intended.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_31": "\nStart thinking of this song as a relationship between the left and right brain. look within yourself and realize who the two participants are in your inner conversation.

A unitarian one is pretty easily present, there's also an easy connection to a lot of broken relationships.\n\nIt can also be shown as a representation of humans in general, who have failed to properly communicate and connect and understand one another, and have since been divided.\n\nThis song means what it means to you.

It's an excellent CD, but Schism blows away every other song on it. I completly agree with the religion aspect of this song, though it isn't hard to see what everyone is saying about relationships. I've had those relationships too. However, what turned me away from my Baptist self (it seems ages ago), is that I spent too much time talking religion with Methodists and Protestants and even other Baptists. Just as the Republican and Democratic parties see a different interpretation of the Constitution, each seperate denomonation interprets the Bible differently. Something so sacred and written by God himself shouldn't be butchered by people trying to gain their own ends. So what did I do? I searched for a new religion and finally grouped myself in the large \"Pagan\" category. Everything turned out great, even without church.\r\nAnd I think that that is what Maynard is talking about.

But, It still has multiple meanings like many tool songs do. It mainly is about communication in all forms. Not just religion. it also talks about communication between society and just ordinary people and the barriers we have to deal with that will either \"cripple\" or if we are able to see past will help us open up more and \"rediscover.\"  as someone stated before not all tool songs have to do with religion philosophy yes but not always religion. in a way maynard is a philosopher.\n\r\nThe other meaning is clearly a love song, i mean come on yes maynard has a dark view on society and religion, but he is human too he has emotions such as love. The song is a about a collapsed or dying relationship that is being destryoyed by (watch it come into play again) thier inability to communicate. The whole album is themed about communications between religions, society, and even ones' self. even the title refers to it. Lateral in one meaning means communication between things, and us meaning us. so Lateralus the communications between us, and everything.\n\r\n By the way Maynard doesn't HATE christianity and he is NOT satanic, despite all the rumors he just doesn't agree with christian views. I beleive he has a right to his opinion as he was raised as a christian, so he has experience in trying to accept it. in a way i am in the same position, i am being brought up as a christian but i must say i have really gone against god and many times questioned my beleif of him. I went atheist for a while then someting happened that made me question again (i won't go into it). i would consider myself a christian i guess but im walking a thin line between it and questioning to mutch making me a doubter or atheist. and also if u read up on him it isn't just christianity he disagrees with it's mainly the concept of organized religion because many are forced into a religion by thier parents or whatever and are never able to really decide for themselves.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_60": "\ntool rulez :D\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_61": "\nEerie song..

When you people love eachother, and get married, one can obsever that their souls are now in motion, or more excited, and alive.\r\n2nd- \"Disintegrating as it goes, testing our communication.\"  This line means that there is constantly a test testing the communication of the 2 people, and it is becoming worse as time goes on.\r\n3rd- \"The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so \"  The two used to be madly in love, yet now that they are married and live with eachother, little things that they used to do, now angers, and tears them apart.\r\n4th- \"We cannot see to reach an end, crippling our communication \"  The fighting never stops.\n\r\n5th- \"I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down \"  He knows that the couple was once one, but now as he has observed it fall apart, he is even more aware of the relationship.\r\n6th- \"No fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire \r\nTo point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over \"  The reason why the couple is fighting is the fault of niether of the two, however, even though they know that, they still want to blame someone.  The temple here, is a metaphor for the Marriage, and how it has fallen down.\r\n7th- \"To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication \"  Marriage thearapy?\r\n8th- \"The poetry that comes from the squaring off between \r\nAnd the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance \"  Some quick vocabulary, 'dissonance' means a lack of harmony.  However, therapy does not work on the couple... perhapes they do not wish to ammend the marriage. 'The poetry that comes from the squaring off ', i read this line as the two accually love the fighing, and it is almost poetic, their anger, that is.  Then, 'finding beauty in the dissonance' means that the two find something beautiful about their lack of harmony.\n\r\n9th- 'Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting'  Their relationship is smoldering and rotting, becuase of adultry (coveting)\n\r\n10th- 'I've done the math enough to know the dangers of a second guessing '  It is too late for them.. however...\n\r\n11th- 'Doomed to crumble unless we grow and strengthen our communication '  The relationship is officially over if the two don't grow up and stop blaming eachother.\n\r\n12th- 'Cold silence has A tendency to Atrophy any Sense of compassion'  now the couple don't talk to eachother, and this line can be read as 'Cold silence has a tendency to wither away any sense of compassion'.

They will not be able to because there is not one specific meaning, except, as I said earlier, its title.  \n\r\nThis song is about schisms and how after there has been one, you wonder why the pieces won't fit back together, for you know that they were at once all together, and you should be able to put them back.  But you can't because sometimes pieces get crushed or warped or bent in the process of breaking.  Once something has schismed, it can never be put back together the way it was.  That is why the last four \"I know the pieces fit\" are much more intensly sung than the rest of the song.  He is expressing his frustration at not being able to put the pieces back together.\n\r\nTo the losers complaining about long posts:  While there is nothing wrong with a short post, the name of this website is \"SongMeanings.\"  Sometimes the meanings are a little involved and require length to analyze.

And that all religion are inter-connected. Another thnig that was interesting was he says that the twelve aposotles where peopel that represented different regions of the world. So they're were chinese, hindu, First Nations, etc.\r\nIt all makes sense if you think about it. And anyone can tell you that most religions are corrupt and have been for a very long time.

Adam Jones was in a band with Tom Morello, guitarist for Rage, before Tool came about. They were good friends and remained good friends throughout their separate careers. \"Schism\" is a tribute to Rage's legacy and breakup, and here is how this is possible.\n\r\nAs we know, Maynard wrote the song. Maynard guested on Rage's 1992 debut album, RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE. He sang a short vocal part in the band's 6th track \"Know Your Enemy.\" In it, he sang of how he was \"sick of complacency.\" Maynard was once asked about lending his voice to Rage. He told reporters that \"I really enjoyed Rage's political sense...in fact, some of their shit inspired the shit I write today.\" He is refering to his own political edge, apparent in songs such as \"Hooker with a Penis.\" This proves that Maynard had a professional and personal relationship with Rage.\n\r\nNext, fastforward to October 18th, 2000. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Zach De La Rocha, lead singer of Rage, publicly quit Rage Against the Machine, saying the following:\n\r\nThe band's \"decision-making process has completely failed,\" de la Rocha said Wednesday. \"It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal. I am extremely proud of our work, both as activists and musicians, as well as indebted and grateful to every person who has expressed solidarity and shared this incredible experience with us.\" \n\r\nMany took this as a citing to Rage's communication breaking up. And so comes a repeating lyrical riff In \"schism\", maynard talking about crippled communication.\n\r\nThe song was released to radio May 6th, 2001. This puts it in the exact songwriting realm of when Rage broke up. That means that these lyrics are completely directed towards Rage's breakup. The following is exactly how I think these lyrics are about Rage. Lyric excerpts are in parentheses, and how they relate to the breakup is outside those parentheses.\n\r\n(I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away \r\nMildewed and smoldering, fundamental differing \r\nPure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers' souls in motion \r\nDisintegrating as it goes, testing our communication \r\nThe light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so \r\nWe cannot see to reach an end, crippling our communication)\r\nMaynard knows the pieces fit because he watched them fall away. Rage's breakup was public, Zach De La Rocha was humiliated by Rage's bassist climbing on the MTV Video Awards set when Rage lost a best rock video category to Limp Bizkit's \"Break Stuff\". Zach complained about this and stated that it was one of the reasons he left Rage. Fundamental differing refers to Zach's statement that \"our decisions do not meet us all collectively.\" The light was Rage's anger in politics. That is what fueled their fire for 8 good musical years. That anger was now all in Zach, and his anger at Rage's public humiliation (bassist on the MTV set) and Rage's decision making falling apart (quoting Zach) made him angry enough to leave Rage, thus burning rage with the fire that started them. The final lyric refers again to Rage's communication falling apart. NEXT LYRIC-------\n\r\n(I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down \r\nNo fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire \r\nTo point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over \r\nTo bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication)\r\n\"No fault, none to blame, this doesn't mean I still desire\"-basically, this is Maynard wanting to believe that the breakup was not fueled only by Zach's stubborness, but still he desires to know what caused the breakup. The next line is about zach's finger-pointing at Tim (the climbing bassist) and the band and not himself. That very finger-pointing tipped rage's temple over. The final lyric again is about the lost communication. NEXT LYRIC--\n\r\n(The poetry that comes from the squaring off between \r\nAnd the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance \n\r\nThere was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away \n\r\nMildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting \r\nI've done the math enough to know the dangers of a second guessing \r\nDoomed to crumble unless we grow and strengthen our communication)\n\r\n\"The poetry that comes from the squaring off between \r\nAnd the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance\" This line comes from the possible side projects and solo projects leaking from the breakup of Rage, and how this horrible dissonance maybe reeks something musically beautiful. A \"second guessing\" is a chance at Rage coming back together, but Maynard then realizes that  that can only be done with the strengthening of communication. NEXT LYRIC----\n\r\n(Cold silence has \r\nA tendency to \r\nAtrophy any \r\nSense of compassion \n\r\nBetween supposed lovers \r\nBetween supposed brothers)\n\r\nCold silence is Rage's bad communication for almost a year before the MTV incident. That silence tends to break up Rage's beautiful compassion for their music and each other, even between Zach (vocals), Tom (guitar), Tim (bassist), and Brad (drums), the four Rage brothers.\n\r\nThe song continues with Maynard babbling about the pieces fitting, because for 8 years they did. RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE, the '92 debut, was the pieces fitting. EVIL EMPIRE, the '96 grammy-winning disc, was the pieces fitting. Even BATTLE OF LA, the 2000 final masterpiece, was activist piece fitting together. But those pieces fell apart, obviously proving the meaning of this song.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_84": "\nTake On Snake has a good point.

Maynard is obviously a very well-read person, just judging from all of the various allusions he makes to fairly obscure writings and such.  So it makes very little logical sense to assume that he doesn't know about the Great Schism.  What makes more sense is to assume that he does indeed know about it, and is probably in fact using it as a metaphor to explain and expound upon various other schisms.  This fits in perfectly with most other Tool songs where he uses one example to prove a broad political point (examples: \"Hooker with a Penis\" - one kid calling Tool sellouts turns into a rant about the evils of capitalism and how we are all part of the system, and \"Aenema\" - doomsday predictions about California sinking into the ocean are turned into a discussion about how we need to cleanse ourselves by flushing all of the corruption away, wherein L.A. is a symbol for everything wrong with the world).  In light of this empirical evidence, and the common sense portion of it (is \"schism\" really a word anyone, even a genius like Maynard, uses in everyday conversation?  Doesn't it make more sense that he used it purposefully for its literal definition, to use as a metaphor?), every other interpretation up here is right, including the one using the literal definition of the Great Schism between the churches.  In this case, the song IS about religion, it IS about Zen philosophies, it IS about relationships (although I doubt it's the typical N'SYNC type fare of boy-meets-girl-who-breaks-his-heart relationships....I refuse to believe Maynard would sink to that low), and it IS about the Great Schism.  Tool is never \"just\" talking about people, or anything else.  It's all metaphorical.\r\nJust my opinion....I could be wrong.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_102": "\nI'm slightly confused as to what this song is about. It is my favourite Tool song.

Some songs have amazing lyrics that make the song all that it is; however, Schism is a song not about lyrics but about music.  Thats how I feel about it, anyway.

In the past and during the times where families were together just \"because,\" making a decision to just simply go on without regarding their own personal happiness.  The father was always the one who would work and make the money.  He didn't need to talk to his kids and his wife much.  The wife was the homemaker who didn't do anything but support her family.  And everyone's roles were set in stone.\n\r\nToday, we have come apart.  Divorce rates soar, people are constantly going about their individual ways when they are not happy.  Co-workers are very volatile and instead of earning an honest buck they voice their opinion to find that satisfaction.  There is nothing wrong with all this.  We needed to take the time to find out our individual selves, our weaknesses and strengths, are basic likes and dislikes.  We needed to know what makes us happy.\n\r\nBut now there is a need for us to come back together.  To resume that supportive family role, but this time we know a lot more about ourselves and so we can make it work out.  This is where I think the trouble lies in society today.  We are still too busy trying to be an individual without realizing how much alike we are.

Every last one of you.\n\r\nI also want to point out that it is interesting that the people making posts and condemning the churches and their closed-mindedness concerning denominations are acting just like the people they are criticizing.  What yourselves.\n\r\nIn my opinion, this song is about relationships--in the most absolute ambigious sense.  [It is true that schism means more than just the Greek Ortho/Roman Cath division in the church.  There are online dictioaries, go read one.]  Relationship isn't a word just applicable to boyfriend/girlfriend situations.  You have relationships with friends, parents, families, lovers, enemies, teachers, kids, adults, people you don't even know, associations even, like churches.  The song is about the thing that makes a relationship a relationship.  The fragility of it and the ease of it to distengrate if not carefully attended to.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_130": "\nPlease only read this if you are a good LISTENER and able to FEEL this MOMENT with me.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the song schism, Maynard, and then some. .. . . . .           \u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\r\nI find interesting how ambiguous many of his songs can be.  Much like the bible or other religious doctrines.  (Probably why there are so many branches of Christianity?) Little is known because Maynard doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reveal much of his meanings nor does he have many interviews.  I think he does this to observe the creativity of man.  How we all project our own view (including me) of the world into his words to each conjure up our own novel interpretation.  Thus is the purpose of all of us having different views or a state of being would cease to exist. \n\r\n I think understanding the writer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s background is important for an accurate depiction of this song.  Maynard was a man who was brought up into private Baptist school.  I feel, in a way, that I can somehow identify with him since I have spent a great deal of my life in a private catholic school.  Though Catholicism is not considered a fundamentalist extremist group by many, I do feel as though I would beg to differ.  I think they are extremists that point the finger about as much as they use the word Christ in a sentence.  Anyhoo, when you experience going to a school that promotes conformity it almost feels like George Orwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1984.  As I went through catholic high school I became more skeptical and felt as if they were continually trying to kill what creativity that made me who I was.  Especially as I wrote well written essays(as my college professors told me).  The underlying thing that I feel that this song is conveying is \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesire to point the finger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \r\nWe all have that desire.  Especially when we get the high feeling of righteous as endorphins release in the brain. Ahhhh Yes! \n\r\nFurthermore I feel this song is about RELIGION/worldviews.  Why would Maynard waste his time wining about close relationships with woman.  It is obvious he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t if you have ever been to one of his shows where he always makes fun of Limp Bizkits high school problems. lol\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  I think it is about communication errors and how labeling people Jewish, Christian, Buddhist, and ect. is the cause of the lack of communication.  When we label people we forget to LISTEN to what they have to say and just shout at the megaphone (metaphor).  Maynard didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spend all of those years in the Baptist school conforming to their dogma thinking how great conformity was.  He thought intelligently with his head(much like eastern philosophers) and manifested a neuroses(by western definition) about what he does not agree with.  It is prevalent in almost every song.  \n\r\nI did a speech on my interpretation once and received feedback in various capacities from the audience.  Here it is:\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnlike wining like a drama queen about high school problems like Limp Bizkit.  Maynard expresses an analytical and introspective tone of real life problems that creates a mystical Experience to any listener.  It is kind of like folk music in a way.  For example, this song Schism that you just heard is about the falling or deterioration of a religion/worldview. Which happens to be one of my favorite songs.   He explains how the cause of that is \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommunication\u00e2\u0080\u009d or lack thereof is the cause of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhole between us\u00e2\u0080\u009d or the conflict.  The problem that contributes to the conflicts is \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesire\u00e2\u0080\u009d to point the finger.  Desire is seen as evil or suffering to Maynard as with other philosophers and Buddhists.  And in the end of the song he says \u00e2\u0080\u009cFinding beauty in the dissonance\u00e2\u0080\u009d Because the songwriter knows that our mind narrows with age and our beliefs, for the most part, are set and stone with age.  Change is hard to come by.  So, rather than denying that, the writer gives a Zen like approach of acceptance of the conflict as he is the observer of all these people yelling at each other; egoism.  It is only when there are differing views there will be a state of being.   \n\r\nWhenever I hear this song I always imagine it to the extreme.  Pictures like on TV that show different fundamentalist religious groups forever at a holy war with each other.  All believing that they are some righteous being and a soldier of God shouting at the enemy and not listening.  Or our president waging war based on the belief that God is somehow blessing America to be a soldier of God.  Maybe even there are some people in this room who believe that you are somehow a soldier of God.  This shows that if you bring heaven down to earth, it only engineers a hell.  A Hell caused by simple communication errors and leaving many people disconnected with each other.  As Maynard so eloquently displays. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\n\r\nPlease write me at eric.melquist@mnsu.edu if you would like to praise or criticize me or ask me what I think of a specific lyric I'd be happy to reply.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t claim to know much about this song but I recognize that we all project our own vision onto the lyrics so I wrote a bit about me to help you understand.

I don't know, that was sort of sketchy what I just said.\n\r\n\"Doomed to crumble unless we grow and strengthen our communication\"\r\nThis means that it will surely bring the end to the human race if Christianity/Catholicism does not accept other beliefs again.\n\r\nI mean, we've got people blowing themselves in the name of their supreme being, and that what other people think is basically heresy.

And chances are, you are going to read what i type, and disagree..  Your disagreement will come from the fact that my belief system doesn't coenside with yours.  beliefs don't stop your mind from functioning, they allow it to work on other things.\n\r\nAlso, i'd like to point out that Catholicism and Christianity are not one in the same.  Chirstianity encompasses any religion that believes that Jesus was the son of God, and came to save the world.  Catholics believe that, along with lutherns, baptists, and methodists.  Its the other rules that they have that set them apart.  Just becuase Catholicism to you seems ignorant, doesn't mean that every christian is that way.\n\r\nBesides, catholicism isn't the be all and end all of the world either.. Right now, there are fewer catholics than ever in recent history.  Peoples belief in a supreme being has gone up, but Catholicism itself is going down.  But even the end of Catholicism won't solve the lack of communication.  why don't  you try to talk to one of the members of the religions who blow themselves up in the name of allah or what-have-you about understanding, and realizing that his religion isn't right, and that he should look at some other ideas.

But I think that it ialso has a more musical connotation. I was just doing some research on the Pythagorean theorem (I am a loser, I know) and I came across Pyhtagorean Tuning. It sparked my interest, and i looked clicked the link. It took me to a page about how Pyhtagorean Comma (or Pythagorean tuning) is based on the idea that \"when one ascends by a cycle of justly tuned perfect fifths (ratio 3:2), leapfrogging 12 times, one eventually reaches a note around seven octaves above the note one started on, which, when lowered to the same octave as the starting point, is (a very small amount over) 23.46 cents higher than the initial note. This interval, 531441:524288 or exactly 1.0136432647705078125:1, is called a Pythagorean comma\" (WIKI) I know that is a bunch of jibberish to most of you, but it is basically just about perfect fifths, yet jumping around from one to another. Anyway, at the bottom of the page, it said,  \"See also Pythagorean Tuning and schisma\" I clicked on the schisma, as I thought, \"Hey, that is ridiculously similar to the song Schism.\" The page then had some more technical talk about musical tuning and theory then any of you will ever care to know, most likely. \n\r\nAnyway, I think that it may be possible that this song either uses elemts of Pythagorean tuning, or is just a reference to it, in some ways.

On the surface, many think its a love song, I pretty much flat out reject this because of the context of the album.   Another theory is that schism has to do with the separation of the churches and Christianity.  This is basically what you get when you type Schism into wikipedia.  However, a dictionary will tell you that schism really means any separation.\n\r\nGiven the mood and topics of the rest of the album (a lot of transcendentalist and dualism (philosophy non-sense)) I think this song is mostly about the separation of the body and the mind.  In metaphysics, libertarians take the stance that causal determinism and free will cannot coincide, and thus that causal determinism is incorrect (this is a highly abridged version).  Thus in order to compensate for the fact that causal determinism doesn't apply to free will, the libertarian will argue that the mind operates on a separate dimensional template than the body and therefore is unaffected by physical laws and past events (the grounds for causal determinism).  What I think maynard is getting at here is that at birth, the mind and the body communicate in a manner that allows an individuals to be free from the confines of society.

I think Schism is an accurate portrayal of what schizophrenia appears to be on the surface. Mono-tone, boring and repetitive, and the fact that it's about a one on one relationship (in the mind) makes it even clearer to me. I've always heard this song on the radio and always felt some kind of relevance to that \"thought process\" but never had an opinion until I saw the video. There was only one being until another was pulled out of \"imagination\" (floor dimensional thing). Then as the original played, the other began to animate, and when it is realized there was only one to begin with, the drums go insane as does the single, split being. Maynard is, or was, writing about mental abuse and other types of oblivion, schizophrenia, to me, is the greatest challenge to overcome. \r\n     The last time I heard parabola, I was embarassed to find that this cool song is exactly like one of those cheesy christian \"healing\" songs I thought were stupid, saying things like \"all this pain is an illusion\" and \"celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing\".

But as the relationship progresses and things happen, the pieces \"fall away\" or \"tumble down.\"  \"Doomed to crumble unless we grow and strengthen our communication\" means to me that they need to talk through their problems rather than watch their relationship deteriorate.\n\r\nThe Schism video seems to portray the religion aspect of this song, though.  As one of my friends described to me while watching the video, almost everything in the video he could relate to the religion aspect of this song.  In the beginning when the two people are coming out from the ground, those are the religions starting.  The first person pulling the other person out of the floor is the religion growing into two different churches.  In the scene where one of the religions is hiding in the crack of the wall watching the other walk by, the hiding religion is plotting against the other church so it will be the dominant one.  When the smaller creatures, or religions, are sprouting from the bigger ones (the small creatures with just a mouth on its face).  This relates to many different types of Christianity sprouting from the original religion.  Baptist, Methodist, Catholic, etc.  In the end, when the two big religions fuse, it proves they are all just the same religion.\n\r\nThis is what I think about this song, and I'm not trying to say it's the only meaning and that I'm right, you're wrong.

Sure, I understand what you're saying that it could mean many things, or it could mean whatever the person reading it percieves... but he does have a very cryptic theme underneath it all. whether its a relationship song or a song about a dude whacking off in his own feaces thats not the part that needs to be interpreted. \n\r\nPoint the finger, blame the other \r\nWatch the temple topple over \r\nTo bring the pieces back together \r\nRediscover communication \n\r\nsupposedly Duality, as in, THIS WORLD. the physical plane. external reality, what we percieve, is only half of existance. there is a positive and a negative. and zero of course. but in this other plane of existance in your mind,( activated by well, speaking about maynard i'll use LSD as our tool) you opporate without space and time. you understand the concept of negative and positive, but there is no difference. they're both just HAPPENING. there is NO duality here. He's taking this RELATIONSHIP issue and relating it back to how his mind is handling it. supposedly if you give in to duality and continue to stress out over a dying relationship ur giving in to the human drama and u need to realize that everything is how it is supposed to be. and nothing matters any way. once you become completely emotionally unattached to external reality all you need to entertain you is what's going on in your own head. you realize you are creating your own reality by being addicted to all the human emotions. this is all about ascension. this is what all religions were screaming at everyone underneath the layers and layers of metaphor. ppl are retarded. \n\r\nThe poetry \r\nThat comes from the squaring off between \r\nAnd the circling is worth it \r\nFinding beauty in the dissonance \n\r\nlets Paraphrase \n\r\n\"the poetry; the myth; the religious metaphors, that are told opposite their scientific and logical explanations are the same thing. it's almost as if, in order to tell the truth about reality and what life is and what \"god\" is in a way that human minds could comprehend 5000+ years ago, the enlightened ones that formed religions wrote a story with layers and layers of metaphors over the mind blowing almighty scientific truth. Not exactly to hide the truth... but to put it out of plane view.. until we evolved enough to use it with modern science. until a time we can realize why they put it out of plain view in the first place: the human mind is addicted also to knowledge. it feels good for the brain to learn. so the bible especially was screaming at mankind to dig deeper. take the persuit of knowledge. If the church knows about this truth (which would crumble them because they are supposed to be the sole vessel for the persuit of God) they are trying to hide it from us when the some of the story says mankind is doomed because we ate from the tree of knowledge. they don't want us seeking that knowledge. it is obvious. \n\r\neventually science and religion will meet right in the middle. yin and yang. \n\r\nand circling the evidence in any religious text and deciphering what scientific FACT is the metaphor giving color to. \"Finding the beauty in the ultimate truth.\" \n\r\nThere was a time that the pieces fit \r\nBut I watched them fall away \r\nMildewed and smouldering \r\nStrangled by our coveting \r\nI've done the math enough to know \r\nThe dangers of our second guessing \r\nDoomed to crumble unless we grow \r\nAnd strengthen our communication \n\r\ntake this with a grain of salt. by the way. \n\r\nwhat if when you are conceived.. when the first molecules begin to construct your brain... think of it as a smaller model of the big bang. on a fundamental level matter is made up of mostly vacum. nothingness. its present in every cell, every atom, every subatomic partical, and quark. all there is is an untapped source of energy teaming with possibility. just as the big bang explodes, expands, takes shape, and finds order. SO DOES YOUR MIND. and keep in mind we are still talking about Maynard. and I could be completely OFF, but i've read many accounts of psychadelic experiences basically sumarized as a resetting of the spark that started your brain. you experience non time and space and enter a part of your brain with limitless possibilities. and i am not alone in my experience either that the tripping mind sometimes gets to a point where all the peaces of.. thought (for lack of a better term) have all finally fit together and everything.. EVERYTHING makes perfect sense. it all fits. everything in life. you see clearly. completely. ...and then its gone. and you have to return to normal ego-reality. \n\r\ndoomed to crumble unless we grow... \r\nstrengthening our communication. \n\r\neasy. \n\r\nfor survival, ultimate evolutionary survival... humans.. need only one thing. other humans. living in absolute harmony with each other.

The lyrics provide an illusion of primordial breaking of the vessels in Lurianic Kabballah. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read in other posts that Tool has been influenced by Kabballah. Lurianic Kabballah holds that the very creation of the universe by God was unstable, and that the early universe, represented by a pottery vessel, could not hold the holy light of God (the Ein Sof or infinite). In this view, the original form of the universe shattered in shards; the universe that we encounter today is thus literally broken, and in need of repair. According to this belief, the practice of following halakha (Jewish religious law) is in order that one can repair the tattered shards of creation through their deeds. Therefore, through each fulfillment of a commanded deed (mitzvah) the Cabbalists believe, a Jew performs an act of tikkun olam, gradually returning the universe to its form as God originally intended, and making humankind a partner in God's creation. There is also a strong sexual connotation to Kabballah which can be seen in the music video which shows the convergence of both the male and female characters.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_289": "\nAnother thought on the male and female characters:\r\nCarl Jung, a big influence in Tool's work, identified the anima as being the unconscious feminine component of men and the animus as the unconscious masculine component in women.\r\nJust a thought.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_290": "\nThis was the first Tool song I heard, and I saw it on T.V. in the very early morning after a huge night.

The sun that kept the world they knew alive has changed.  this led to a consequent ice age and like a said before the thawing creates the separation and the crippling of their communication.  They cannot seem to reach an end because they are so disconnected and cannot see over the horizon when they look out into this vast ocean. \n\r\n\"No fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire\r\nTo point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over\r\nTo bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication\"  Maynard is saying no one is to blame its just the earths nature that we have been disconnected, but he still enjoys releasing his anger (aenema).  After watching Al Gore speak we can all say, \"Why did people vote for bush, look where the world is going: the future generations will experience extreme heat (and possibly the end of this world stage*I'll talk about that more later).

BTW I'm not emo or goth.  Because after this heat reaches its peak and wipes out the human population.  I believe there will be a new beginning to what we think of as the world.  And it seems very logical... Everything about humanity seems to have reached its peak.  Technology can't go much further (satellites can see me from a gazillion miles away, you don't need to do anything: a robot will do it for you, soon you could play with exact replicas of people in video games).  Once we become more reliant on technology all of our  abilities will diminish because they are useless and become dormant without use.  Face it humanity is on the downfall.  But after this heat and following ice age there will be a new world.  For from all of the bullshit we have today (if you need a reminder just listen to aenema).

As one example, you can view the aboriginal people of Australia being in the first level of consciousness where they are able to remember what eachother saw although they may not have seen it themselves.\n\r\nThe next level, which I think Maynard is singing about in this song is the level humans in general are going through in which we are seperated and have a somewhat distant feeling of empathy for eachother although we can't remember eachother's thoughts or anything but we can simply understand another's expression of their thoughts.\n\r\nThe third level is another level of connectedness much like the first level but it is more powerful and there is a complete and perfect understanding of every other human being.  It's a level of viewing eachother as a single being...the One Consciousness.\n\r\nI see the music video as well as the lyrics representing this as I will now discuss:\n\r\nIn the music video, you can see it starts with a connectedness between the two beings as they touch and explore eachother but as the song progresses, the two can no longer touch but only stare at eachother from across the room.  In the end, the two beings become one and are all-powerful (as expressed by the flashes of a fire phi spiral).\n\r\nIn the lyrics I see each moment of discussing the crumbling pieces, it's simply the breaking apart of our joined understanding that exists in the first level of consciousness.  \"No fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire...\" is a line that I feel explains the fact that this seperation, or \"Schism\", is necessary and is a part of humans' mental evolution.  Although it's necessary and there is no single cause for it, it doesn't mean that he (Maynard) doesn't desire to blame someone for putting him in this broken and flawed state of lack of understanding.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_347": "\nCorrection of last line: ...putting him in this broken and flawed state of lack of communication and understanding.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_348": "\nthankyou amonhorus!!\r\nyou fucking hit it straight on!\r\ni'm glad i didnt have to write upi a long ass thing on it, you did it for me dude.\r\n:]\r\nfirst person not to use the church split in their meaning. the splitting of the church is just so... obvious. you know? as is the lovers interperetation. that doesn't mean that those meanings aren't contained within the song, just that they are not the deepest possible meanings in there.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_349": "\nThis song is about Maynard's struggle with his own beliefs, simple and sound.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_350": "\nBecause, we all know that he struggled with his mother's beliefs.

The truth about this song is, however.  That Maynard took his brilliance to a whole new level.  You have the religious standpoint correct.  He was obsessed with it.  But have any of you read the story of the tower of babel?  It was a great tower that was spoken about at the begining of the old testament.  In those days the people were unified as one race, humans.  No separation due to skin color or area of origin because everyone lived in the same area.  They were technologically advanced beyond comprehension (archeologists found a batery in an Aztec temple that was solar powered and still had life left in it).  The tower of babel was an architecural masterpiece.  And the people were trying to build it up  to the stars, be one with the gods in a sense.  But like in any other time in history, God stopped us before we let our heads get too big.  Reminding us who is boss.  If we were trying to be one like him through this building, and He allowed it, then what proof would be left of his might.  He warned them against it and they ignored him.  So God collapsed the tower, no one inside was harmed, but instead, each and every person on the planet no longer spoke the same common language as before.  Hence the term \"babel\" it refers back to when we all were scattered throughout the earth to others that spoke like us.

Probly because i started listening to this song alot when me and my ex gf started growing farther apart. I loved her so much i would do anything for her, even not be myself anymore, be what i thought she wanted me to be. And that, being who i was not, is exactly what changed her feelings for me, hence the line \"The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us\", my love for her is exactly what ended it. I was afraid to truely communicate with her about these things because i was scared of what the truth might be, \"crippling our communication\". Therefore, when i was my true self \"the pieces fit\", and i \"watched them fall away\" when i was no longer myself. So i guess the lessoned learned is just be urself, no matter what. I think thats the secret to true happiness. \n\r\nAlso, like some others, this song really didnt catch my fancy when i first heard it. but after a long time of not listening to it, it came on, and i liked it. the line \"I know the pieces fit, 'cause i watched them fall away\" always gets stuck in my head.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_381": "\nand bWa, think about it, its like a piece of glass. and u hit it was a hammer so it shatters. you know that the pieces would all fit bk together to make the same piece of glass, you would know that because u watched it break.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_382": "\nisn't it obvious that TOOl was doing a puzzle when they wrote this song.

Regardless, here is my 2 cents.\n\r\nListening to this song this morning, I am stricken with a reminder of Genisis 11:1-9, The Tower of Babel. For those of you who aren't familiar with the tale here it is in a nutshell.\n\r\nMankind is assembled in one unified nation under one language and arrogantly decides to build a tower that reaches \"to the heavens\" in his own honor. God sees this (about halfway through the building process of the tower), gets a little pissed off, sends man off to various corners of the earth and gives them each new languages. communication is broken between man in his original unified country and the tower is never completed, and after many years falls apart crumbles away etc. etc.\n\r\nIt has already been agreed that this song has an extremely religious undertone. This undertone followed by the theme of communication, and the abundant imagery of natural decay and falling apart serve as the basis for the tower of babel relationship. \n\r\nIn these modern times, miscommunication is a big issue between the 195 some odd recognized nations of the world. War, hostility, exploitation, famine, hunger, unfair trade, etc. etc. have all resulted from various forms of miscommunication. Maynard is striving to tell the listener to communicate better (though how I do not know), because even when people speak the same language, communication still is an issue.\n\r\nMaynard further asserts that the pieces fit, and that mankind can someday rediscover communication...\n\r\nI don't really feel like doing an in depth analysis of the whole song and how it relates to Genesis, but here's a start, hopefully you can see it in the lyrics.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_384": "\nI see babel was touched on. hooray.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_385": "\nby bWa on 06-17-2008 @ 06:19:29 AM\r\nDon't you feel irony in the part: \"I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away\"?

They were having all kinds of problems as Maynard puts it \"going down blind alleys\" and not finding anything. Maynard was getting frustrated at the other members of the band and left to go on tour with A Perfect Circle so the other members could work out what they needed to do. The line \"The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so. We cannot see to reach an end, crippling our communication.\" is about them not being able to see eye to eye in the studio and then the line \"No fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire. To point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over. To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication\" is about the fact that Maynard wasn't with the other members when they were working on the album but he still feels that he can \"point the finger\" when he came back to things he didn't like. The temple toppling over is just a metaphor for the album being the temple and their inability to work together was causing it to not be completed or \"toppling over\". Lastly the line \"The poetry that comes from the squarin' off between. And the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance\" talks about how even though there was conflict and it took arguing to get to the end there is beauty made out of the dissonance which is a more eloquent way of saying conflict. Maynard had a great line in this article where he said there is no creativity without some pain. Anyway you cut it this is one of their more personal songs and having seen them 6 times on the Lateralus tour and 7 more on the 10,000 days tour, they always have played it and I think they will keep it on their set list in future tours. By the way, the \"on the road mix\" with the double time guitars and Carey's insane speed fills are the best way to hear this song.

This is going to take me awhile to type out, as I'm fairly tired, but I will share my interpretation nonetheless. First of all, Maynard is extremely intelligent. His word choices, although at a glance nothing too impressive, in reality are extremely well-chosen. I would love to spend a day with him to hear his opinions and views on life.\n\r\nI know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away\n\r\n--- Biblically, the earth was of \"of one language, and one speech.\" This makes sense when you take into consideration that only Noah and his family survived the flood. The families of the sons of Noah \n\r\ntraveled east to the plains of Shinar and decided to build a tower to reach to heaven, and make a name so as to prevent them from being scattered across the face of the Earth. This is creepy if you pay any \n\r\nmind to \"conspiracy theories\" involving the Illuminanti and a New World Order. Man has been wanting to play god since the beginning of time. It's also worth noting the Bible says they used slime as mortar to \n\r\nhold the bricks (pieces) together. Slime isn't going to hold bricks together. Slime is thin, slippery mud. Half-water. I know quite a bit about masonry. While you do add plenty of water to mortar mix, it \n\r\nhardens. Slime doesn't. Anything that is half liquid isn't going to hold anything together. \"And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now \n\r\nnothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.\" Now everyone's communication \n\r\nis fucked up. Language was scrambled. This effectively crippled any hope of completing the tower (most likely meant to represent becoming God), considering without being able to communicate measurements, \n\r\ndesign, and such, there is no way in hell you are going to be able to coordinate construction of anything, including masonry. Maynard is obviously an intelligent guy. The \"pieces\" that fell away refer to \n\r\nboth communication and the bricks that crumbled in attempting to build the tower without any communication betwen the laborers.\n\r\nMildewed and smoldering, fundamental differing\n\r\n--- Used this this context, mildewed is a synonym for diseased. A less well-known definition of diseased is unsound or disordered. Disorder is exactly what happened as a result of loss of communication. \n\r\nSmoldering means burning with little smoke and no flame. It also means to exist in a repressed state. Imagine all of a sudden being unable to communicate with your brothers. All language scrambled. This line \n\r\nmeans that an essential part of communication between individuals was removed.\n\r\nPure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers' souls in motion\n\r\n--- This line is somewhat cryptic. I get the feeling that it means Without any sense or experience, save wanting to find the end, people reproduced subconciously in order for their descendants to exist, \n\r\ncontinuing their existence.\n\r\nDisintegrating as it goes, testing our communication\n\r\n-- Unity and cohesion is lost, as the original intentions become reduced to fragments.\n\r\nThe light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so\n\r\n-- God was the light that \"fueled the fire.\" Fairly self-explanatory.\n\r\nWe cannot see to reach an end, crippling our communication\r\n-- From soul to soul, we never can see when the end will be. 200 years ago, people were most likely talking of how Christ would soon return (like today) and living accordingly. People are confused.\u007f People don't know how they got here or how it will end.\n\r\nI know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down\r\n-- The use of the word tumble rather than fall away isn't a coincidence. In the first line of the song, fall away refers to what was supposed to be drifting away from its established course.\n\r\nNo fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire\r\n-- There is no individual to blame for the loss of communication and why we're here.\n\r\nTo point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over\r\n-- He desires to blame this mess on someone else and watch religon crumble.\n\r\nTo bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication\r\nThe poetry that comes from the squarin' off between\r\nAnd the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance\r\n-- Even with the lack of harmony, and seemingly pointless existence, there is still beauty, truth, art, and originality to be found within and from it all.\n\r\nThere was a time that the pieces fit but I watched them fall away\r\nMildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting\n\r\nI've done the math enough to know the dangers of a second guessing\r\n--- We're diseased and our communication is repressed.

It is vague while being descriptive all at the same time. When viewing these lyrics, the first thing that comes to mind is the schism of the Christian Church long ago, known as the Great Schism or the East-West Schism.\n\r\nThe Christian Church had been separated in the late 1000\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, splitting into the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church. They split because of different reasons- the East belonged to the Greek language, and the Roman Catholic became Latin. Not only this, but they had a disagreement on who would lead the church. One side wanted the emperor to appoint the head patriarch, while the other welcomed the Idea of a Pope to lead. They also disagreed on the worship of Icons, images of crucified Jesus or the Virgin Mary. They disagreed on which holiday was to be the holiest, as well. A religion that was supposedly composed of people who loved each other was torn apart. Still today there is evidence of this split.\n\r\nNot only did the Christian Church split. Further back in time there was another great schism- the Islamic Schism occurred between 632 to the late 600\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The Islamic religion was founded by Muhammad Ali, and is the newest major religion, still existing today. When Muhammad died without leaving a successor to lead the religion, a dispute broke out. Some of the people wanted to appoint based on bloodline, while others wanted to appoint based on friendship and knowledge. Abu Bakr was appointed caliph after meeting with Muhammad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close family at his funeral. However, many of Muhammad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s companions wanted another Ali to lead. This occurred within the whole Muslim community, and eventually they split into two groups; the Sunnis and Shi\u00e2\u0080\u0099ites. Today in the Middle East there is still fighting going on between them.\n\r\nBoth instances involve a dispute over a leader, as it seems. However, there are some ways of looking at this song that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involve religion. In the music video, a man and woman are trying to communicate with each other. The two of them communicate in different ways and cannot get the message across because of it. Many people look at this song as a love song, as strange as it sounds. There has been some event that has crippled their relationship, and as a result they break apart. The problem with the three examples given is simple; it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit the style of Tool. The band isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t known for making too many songs on simple occurrences or things that happened only in the past. They deal with more current issues; even if the song kept them together they know their fans would rather not deal with personal issues. You may say \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the religion examples fit, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still happening today.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It still isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t their style, as they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that involved with connecting Christianity or Islam, or with any specific religion for that matter. If you look in the music video, as well, there are no hints towards those meanings other than just the title and the context.\n\r\nMany consider art and science to be two different worlds. Some people are more scientifically oriented, while others are more artistically oriented. It is known that the two are contradicting essences, as art is \u00e2\u0080\u009cpure creativity and freedom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while science is \u00e2\u0080\u009cmechanism and strict adherence to laws.\u00e2\u0080\u009d What I believe this song to be is just this; the schism between art and science. If you take a good look at the music video to interpret it, the man and the woman are given opposite sex for a reason. Explained in notes on the anima (has not been released yet), the anima is the unconscious counterpart of the persona. Being a counterpart of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personality, this means that one has the opposite gender to the other. In men, the anima is the essence of a woman. It is also the level of artistic creativity that the male has. There are four defined levels of anima development:\n\r\nEve: The lowest level of creativity, the beginning where everyone has to start.\n\r\nHelen: The second level of creativity, in this level the male has a strong schism between external talents and mechanisms and internal qualities.\n\r\nMary: The third level of creativity. In this level the male has developed a sort of spirituality but has not obtained a good communication between his persona and his anima. There is such a communication, but not as developed as the final level.\n\r\nSofia: The fourth and final level of creativity, named after the Greek word for wisdom. In this phase the male has a good communication between his persona and anima. He has a great amount of creativity and knowledge, which comes from his persona.\n\r\nIn a female, the opposite occurs. On each lever she moves toward masculinity in her animus (the female version of the anima). This means she develops more scientific and mechanical skills and planned action. The four levels of this are the same as a male\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intensity of creativity:\n\r\nThe athlete: The first level of masculinity, the embodiment of physical power.\n\r\nThe planner: The second level of masculinity, planned action is more used as well as independence.\n\r\nThe professor: The third level of scientific development, English skills such as mechanics are more developed.\n\r\nThe guide: Like Sofia, this is the highest level of the development of a female\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animus.\n\r\nAs the anima/animus develops, communication with one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self and others develops as well. When there is an imbalance between one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s persona and anima, there may be less communication and creativity. The persona is the person that holds the anima, defined by the knowledge the person holds. If one does not know enough to explain his or her creativity, then chances are the communication isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t what it is said to be.\n\r\nWatching the video from beginning to end, there are a lot of clues to an art and science schism meaning. The woman in the beginning is both logic and art. She ventures the world until she realizes not only art can explain everything. She sinks into the floor while the feet of the man appear. She pulls herself out realizing the feelings she has left behind. In doing so, she grabs the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet out of the floor, splitting art and science into two contradicting essences, two different genders. She cannot communicate with the man knowing they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak the same language. No matter how hard they try, they cannot make ends meet. Throughout the video they try different ways and methods to get their messages across. Eventually at the end they become juxtaposed and become one mind yet again. This corresponds to the lyrics as at the end a circling flame is shown.\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us, so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\nThe anima/animus references can be seen as well. To the man, the woman is his only counterpart. To the woman, there are several male counterparts. If you notice inside the male a creature forms whose gender seems to be most likely male. During the video multiple of these creatures attack the woman. In a male\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anima, there is only one \u00e2\u0080\u009cguide\u00e2\u0080\u009d that is a female, seen in dreams. In a female\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animus, there are multiple male figures seen in dreams.\n\r\nConcluding, this complex song was the product of an attempt to bring art and science back together. They were once one long ago, until our desire for knowledge split them up.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_402": "\nIt's about tetris\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_403": "\nThis is a song about a 2000 piece puzzle.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_404": "\nReading the responses to this made me want to scream.  People really think this is a song specifically about the schism of Christianity?  I can't handle it...  \n\r\nThe word schism is not just used for a split in the church, people.  I never would have even remotely thought about this song's relationship to Christianity had I not visited this page.  I assumed it was about a relationship that was destined to inevitably fall apart, as all relationships seem to do.  The only slightly religious word in the entire thing was temple, but that is not enough evidence to point me in that direction.\n\r\nSchisms develop between people in relationships, friendships, and yes... even in their spiritual lives.  But judging by what Maynard was going through at the time this was written and also realizing that most Rock songs are about a handful of subjects, I can safely say that I don't think he had the \"Great Schism\" in mind when writing this.  I think it's about human relationships (Friendships, lovers, etc...)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_405": "\nTool \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Schism:\r\nSchism approaches the view of a fundamentalist religious believer who believes that his/her religion is the right one. The song deals with this individual seeing his religion rise and fall. This is apparent throughout many of the lyrics of the song. The title, Schism, is defined as a division of unity often associated with a division within churches.  \r\n\tThis religious believer states that he knows \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the pieces fit, cuz I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve watched them fall away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This refers to religions and how they are often formed, rectified, or reformed by denouncing other religions and pointing out what is wrong with their practices or scriptures. This is a common practice amongst religions. Christianity is a great example of this. Instead of unifying to one religion, there were many separate divisions of Christianity and there still are.  While schism especially applies to the separation of Orthodox and the Roman Catholic church, this song can be applied to most religious sects.\r\n\tIn the 4th paragraph of the song the speaker is saying that, they are not sure if their pieces fit anymore, but for the sake of their church they still need to hold on to their religion. Their religion is now not as large or not the new religion to follow and they are envious, hence the line \u00e2\u0080\u009cmildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The last two lines deal with followers second guessing or moving away from the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s religion, so they need to gather more members or else their religion will crumble. \r\n\tMaynard is pointing out the systematical cycle that encompasses religions.  A new religion rises at the death of an old one.  Religions don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t unify, all seeming to point out all the flaws of other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s practices instead of focusing on or admitting their own flaws. This religion begins to lose members and a new religion arises and starts to take over. The speaker and his followers do not unify, but instead try to grow out the church and conform more people to their belief in a last ditch effort to save their church.  The last lines are mocking how most religions are peaceful and point out the unification of humanity, like saying that we are all brothers and sisters, these organizations themselves go to great lengths to distance themselves from other religious groups.  The repeating of the words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know the pieces fit\u00e2\u0080\u009d further emphasize that these people are typically fundamentalists who are closed minded and do not \u00e2\u0080\u009cthink\u00e2\u0080\u009d that their ideas are right, they \u00e2\u0080\u009cknow\u00e2\u0080\u009d without question.\n\n\n", "comment_406": "\nAs many have pointed out a lyric can mean a lot of things and its mostly an interpretation from your own perspective, from what you\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b4ve experienced, but thats the beauty of it, that we all can take part of a universal meaning. For me this song is about our world today and our lives in it, but mostly its about the structures and constructions that strangle our humanity. \"Ive seen the pieces fit\" for me means the experience of the way the industrial- technical- zeitgeist change how we live in the world, how we lose communication and nearness to each other. I see it as statement that says \"I\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b4ve seen through it all\", he has seen through the matrix of lies that has been pulled over his eyes to conceal this exploitation. In this way its kind of a paranoid attitude, or is it? \"Cold silence has a tendency to..\" is quite obvious, if you detach yourself from life, that is if you become rational and cold, you are also leaving your compassionate side of yourself behind. This is the danger with the technical zeitgeist, that we become rational robots in tune with technology. Reason is good, but not to be absurdly rational, we have to grow and incorparate other sides to such as love, friendship, desire etc. As I see it is a warning about where our world is going and what it is doing with people. I dont think its so much about religion, even though a temple is mentioned, it can be a symbol for the current worldview which also is a kind of religion. People today may follow values like they where commandments, like be succesful, make a lot of money, become rational etc. As always a lyric can mean different things for different people, this is what it means to me and what I get out of it.   \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_407": "\nIf ur in a serious relationship and u hit a rough patch, this song will be about relationships to u.

In order to continue the path one must \"reestablish\" communication with this \"universe\" and soul being. As for the lovers part; that can mean that the connection of communication to the \"universe\" is much stronger when two people are in love and work together through these higher vibrational energies to \"reestablish\" this communication. But that's just my point of view. It doesn't really matter if it's right; all I know for a fact is this a very good song!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_410": "\nHello all;\r\n   I'm afraid my interpretation is'nt based in religion, however I can attempt to Quantify this song.\r\nI believe it is about two people who fall in love, coexist, and when their relationship begins to break apart they are powerless to stop it.\n\r\n   I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away \r\nMildewed and smoldering, fundamental differing \r\nPure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers' souls in motion \r\nDisintegrating as it goes, testing our communication \r\nThe light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so \r\nWe cannot see to reach an end, crippling our communication \n\n\r\n   The first two lines refer to the pieces of his relationship falling apart. The third, \"Pure intention juxtaposed\" (very near) \"will set two lovers' souls in motion\", basically means two people of strong will in union may clash on an emotional level. Disintegrating (falling apart) in time, leading to a break down in communication. \"The light that fueled our fire\" represents the the love of their youth. That same intensity turned and created a space between them, a \"Schism\", or a separation. Schism would also be defined as a separation particularly one created by rending or other violent manner. The last line tells me that as hard as they try a resolution is beyond reach once again cutting one off from the other.\n\n\r\n   I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down \r\nNo fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire \r\nTo point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over \r\nTo bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication \n\r\nThe poetry that comes from the squarin' off between \r\nAnd the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance \n\n\r\n  Once again the first line refers to a crumbling relationship, the next implies a lack of fault yet a desire to point the finger. Neither is shameless, yet both are without blame. The rest signifies a desire to restart, to begin anew. \"The poetry that comes from squarin' off between and the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance\" Describes a point where only petty satisfaction exists, as dissonance is defined as discord or cacophony, basically disagreement. There is a suggestion of this in the video when the woman fingers and then pulls from his neck something, then drops it on the floor. It promptly turns into these nasty little gremlins with gaping mouths full of teeth that latch onto the woman's face. I think that they represent the darts and arrows that are traded by people in such situations. Literally, some thing from him tore her apart.\n\n\r\n   There was a time that the pieces fit but I watched them fall away \r\nMildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting \r\nI've done the math enough to know the dangers of a second guessing \r\nDoomed to crumble unless we grow and strengthen our communication \n\r\nCold silence has \r\nA tendency to \r\nAtrophy any \r\nSense of compassion \n\r\nBetween supposed brothers \r\nBetween supposed lovers \n\n\r\n   The line \"strangled by our coveting\" (given that the first lines have been defined earlier) represents desires out side the relationship growing until the already severly compromised union cannot compete and suffers even more. Cold silence tending to atrophy compassion represents the lack of feeling that signifies the eventual death of the union; The end of the love and compassion that drove them to such heights has faded. The last two lines suggest to me that said unions could be inclusive of more than just intimate relations between a man and a woman, but also between friends or family. \n\r\n For what it's worth, That is what is see and hear with this song,\r\n         Regards, Spoojman\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_411": "\nI would have to agree with people saying that this song is about REDISCOVERING communication.

This entire album and many more song to me are about getting in touch with our creator and riding the spiral to the next dimention. I listen to the songs and it is not just the lyrics, but the music takes you another level of thought or consciousness(or unconsciousness), the drumming is ritualistic in many parts and it is what drew me into the music in the first place. Sacred Geometry is all over this album, I love it. Lateralus is the ultimate. I am totally left brain and this music makes me engage my right brain. I heard this song maybe 20 times before I started to listen to the lyrics, I liked it not hearing the lyrics, then I got it and love it. It is not one piece(lyrics), but the whole that makes this music great. People keep giving total credit to Maynard, and granted he is the center piece of tool, but without the rest of the band, it's just meaningless (but fun) Puscifier... \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_434": "\nOK...I know I spelled \"dimension\" wrong.

However, I believe the song has alot to do with sacred geometry.  \n\r\n\"The poetry that comes from the squaring off in between, and the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance.\"\n\r\nWhen drawing an approximate logarithmic spiral, some use a method of using squares (squaring off) to draw the angles (circling).  What I think they are saying is that they want us to discover the same wonders of the universe that they all have studied... the circling (studying) is worth it.  Although we all grow and change, we remain the same, just like a fibonacci spiral.  TOOL obviously has a passion for sacred geometry.  This spiral seems to be a reoccuring theme throughout the entire lateralus album (mainly in the song lateralus; \"Swing on the spiral\").  The entire song (instrumentals and vocals) is set to a specific fibonacci sequence.  Amazing. But wait, there is more.\n\n\r\nEssentially, it is one huge puzzle for us all to solve, and I spend many nights doing my research LOL.  When all of the lateralus songs are played in a specific fibonacci sequence all the songs fit together and flow perfectly.  I wont tell you the numbers because that would ruin TOOLs objective; to make us think.  \n\r\nSuppossedly, (the following is only what I have heard, do not take this part too literal; however, it would not surprise me one single bit if it is absolutely true) if you put songs in fib. order, then, split triad down the middle and reverse the second half, then superimpose it onto the first half, then it plays beatufilly up until schism.  This is when it all is suppossed to fall down, until the rift starts then it flows properly again.  How fucking incredible is a perfectly symmetrical album.  Effin genious all these ppl are. \n\r\nJust a thought  :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_437": "\nThe thing that makes this song great, as with many other Tool songs, you can think about the meaning for yourself and how this song relates to your personal life. \n\r\nIn my opinion, like many posters above me, the song is about the separation between two people who have been very close together: \r\n\"I know the pieces fit because I watched them fall away\" \n\r\nMost of the time the separation is not anyone's fault, but is rather the product of the path that given people decide to take: \r\n\"Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing. \r\nPure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion \r\nDisintegrating as it goes testing our communication\" \n\r\nThe situation worsens when the two people are trying to find a reason for the split and end up blaming each other: \r\n\"I know the pieces fit because I watched them tumble down \r\nNo fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to \r\nPoint the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.\" \n\r\nAt this point it is still time to save the relationship through the efforts of two individuals to start communicating with each other: \r\n\"To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication\" \n\r\nBut since we are human, this does not always happen, our pride takes over us and destroys what is left of the relationship, so the only thing left to do is to learn the lesson from our mistakes: \r\n\"The poetry that comes from the squaring off between, \r\nAnd the circling is worth it. \r\nFinding beauty in the dissonance.\" \n\n\n", "comment_438": "\nThis song was actually written about the crumbling relationship between Maynard and the rest of Tool because he was working with A Perfect Circle and spending no time with Tool. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_439": "\nDue to my experiences, I interpret the song to be a psychologically theoretical explanation for the inexplicable nature of a schism between close human beings, whether it be lovers, family or real friends. \n\r\nI know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away\r\nMildewed and smoldering, fundamental differing\r\nPure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers' souls in motion\r\nDisintegrating as it goes, testing our communication\r\nThe light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so\r\nWe cannot see to reach an end, crippling our communication\n\r\nThis is about the frustration of knowing that at one time, all was right in the world when you were with this person, spiritually. You know that things CAN work, because they HAVE been working, but those emotional connections are now severed. Pure intention juxtaposed probably means that generally in a separation, one of the parties has the \"we CAN make things work again\" sentiment, while the other has the \"there is no use\" sentiment. The two argue and debate their feelings, and in the process they are changed forever, for better or worse. The passion that was once felt, when two lovers feel that absolutely nothing can separate them, is the same, strong, driving force that creates the division between the two souls. It causes you to do irrational, desparate things, for better or worse. Examples are people immediately hooking up with somebody else to evoke jealousy in the event of a break up, and the irrational things that people do to try and prove that their love can continue on. I love that he hammers home the concept of communication becoming crippled. Everybody knows that in the event of a break up, there is NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING you can do to try to win them back if they are truly not willing to make the sacrifices to rekindle things. You can not reach a realistic agreement, when both sides have such different views. I know people who have appeared to hate each other for far longer than they were together; they will NEVER be decent to each other ever again. This is the fundamental differing that is mentioned. \n\r\nI know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down\r\nNo fault, none to blame, it doesn't mean I don't desire\r\nTo point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over\r\nTo bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication \n\r\nThe writer sees the love unraveling, and recognized what is happening based on experience/observations. However, they are STILL powerless in the situation, due to the difference of feelings between the separated. Everybody is willing to point the finger, and take none of the blame in the event of a separation, but the hard truth is that both parties are at least partly responsible. Even if you know what you did was wrong and cuased the end of the relationship, or the wall tumbling down, you will still seek to blame the other party. Even though you will naturally desire to play the blame game, you will also always have the desire to make things civil, even though the emotions rule out over logic and this rarely ever happens. But you still have the desire, as futile as it may be. \n\r\nThe poetry that comes from the squarin' off between\r\nAnd the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance \n\r\nThis is the whole reason for the song, at least in my interpretation. It is the song in a nutshell. It is one of those bittersweet things in life, that, even if you totally comprehend the situation from a strong, psychological standpoint, you are still powerless to stop the awesome force, like same poles on a magnet, making the impossible to overcome repelling force between objects. Songs about heartbreak are among the most, if not the most, popular influences in music composition, period. The negativity can actually be beautiful, like an act of nature that, although destructive, leaves the viewer in awe. \n\r\nThere was a time that the pieces fit but I watched them fall away\r\nMildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting\r\nI've done the math enough to know the dangers of a second guessing\r\nDoomed to crumble unless we grow and strengthen our communication \n\r\nThis seems to be about our decision making going awry, and neglecting/ignoring what is in our hearts. Second guessing your feelings and rationalizing becuase of being hurt(and fear) are futile, and \"dangerous,\" yet we do it anyway. We do what makes us feel satisfied, vindicated, now, but these decisions drive us apart in the long run and create a division instead of the galvanizing/repair of our feelings towards each other that can occur if we set our differences aside, and let our deep feelings for each other govern our decisions. Communication is once again visited, as that can be the deal maker or deal breaker in a separation between two people. It is either effective, or it isn't. There really is no in between here. Our ego can allow us to be governed by our emotions, or it can govern our decisions and reasoning enough to allow for a mutual repair of a relationship... but both parties need to be on the same page here, otherwise it all falls apart quickly and surely. Our emotional need to try to make two wrongs become a right can either be suppressed, or it isn't, and destroys communication.\n\r\nCold silence has\r\nA tendency to\r\nAtrophy any\r\nSense of compassion\n\r\nBetween supposed brothers\r\nBetween supposed lovers \n\r\nThis is a very powerful part of the song. Once again, communication(although indirectly this time) is the focal point. The worst thing you can do in the event of a schism is to simply avoid and repress any desire to keep in touch with the other. This silence destroys any willingness that the seemingly irreconcilable partner(the one that initiated the break up) might have had, period. This can be where the tendency for the vindictive frame of mind can be either started, or magnified. Let's face it, we are acting out of spite, and not compassion, more often than not, in the long run of a schism. The cowardly silence that is seen as a way to assuage the other and avoid conflict is not a positive contributor as you may irrationally believe. It silently drives the wedge further. I have had very specific experience with this myself, unfortunately. \n\r\nThe repetition of \"I know the pieces fit\" at the end of the song is simply the writer voicing their frustration, of what I mentioned earlier, which is the logical knowledge that two people can coexist, obviously due to the fact that it was reality for some amount of time, but for reasons unseen by most, they simply can not, even though they were able to at one time. We can not fathom such an abrupt, colossal change in one or both of us, and simply long for the time to return when both souls lived in harmony. \n\n\n\n", "comment_440": "\nThe beautiful thing about Tool, A Perfect Circle, and Maynard is that there is no right or wrong with interpretations of their songs.

Just referring to the breakdown of something, but there's hope for the future because it was once whole. It can be applied to anything like that though. Shit happens a lot like that in life, it just breaks down, and all the rationalizing and harsh feelings get between the truly-desired reunion, or resolution. This schism between you and your goal, whether that be in a person or a former way of being, is actually helpful because only when you see something broken down into pieces do you realize the full weight of the put-together puzzle.

Because of the focusing capabilities of the microscope, you can only focus on one layer at a time.\n\r\nThis is the same with Maynard's lyrics... The lyrics have multiple focal points (or layers of truth) that are separated from each other while residing in the same specimen (song). No layer is right or wrong, but every layer is open to interpretation.\n\r\nI feel that the trick that Maynard wants us (the listener) to grasp in his lyrics, and in our lives in general, is to not focus like a microscope on on particular layer, but rather internalize the whole of the song, its meaning, our faith (or lack of it), and our experience. This will allow us to reach a higher consciousness of self and of our place in the greater hierarchy of the universe and allow for us to transcend the pettiness of life itself.\n\r\nHowever, the multiple layers that Tool uses ensures that most listeners will be able to identify with at least one aspect, and because of it will keep people listening...

This song is not about the separation of church and state, its not about any type of social thing or about anything you would normally think. No. Instead, this video (and many others from Tool) are directly related to DMT experiences. Schism takes the cake though. I had explained to a friend some of DMT experiences, and a few days later he was telling me to watch Schism, sure enough Schism relives practically all of my profound trips and organizes them back into a contextual story.  You have to understand their is a huge meaning behind this video, and it's purification. Purifying ones self so that you can connect with your astral/higher self and reach that altered state of consciousness psychonauts call the god head experience. Every single aspect of this video comes straight out of a DMT experience, from the purification of the negative black goo, to the connecting of the higher self and everything in between.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_476": "\nThis is a pretty strait forward piece If you have ever been in the situation before.  When you can't seem to come to any sort of agreement with a loved one and it tears you apart.  You can see the series of events that lead up to the situation at hand, but you can't change them.  You watch yourself fit into the puzzle and start pointing the finger and blaming the other.  You watch your communication start to \"mildew and smolder\" as you have lost touch with how to be open and honest with each other.  You resent each other as well as yourslefs because you see you are doing the same.  \n\r\nCold silence has a tendency to atrophy sense of compassion \n\r\nGrowing cold and bitter.

Relationships with anybody or any group.  Or put simply, relationships with anything a part of the collective conscious.  \n\r\nIn the beginnings of a person to person relationship, 'pure intention' (our own inner voice) brings us to another person.  Our communication with that person is what tests our ability to keep living by our intuition.  When a relationship begins, there is a fire between the two of you.  Intuitions line up, and you want similar things.  But the more we communicate, the more of a test our relationship becomes.\n\r\nOr, on a larger perspective, messages can be lost/misconstrued between two nations...which results in a bad relationship.\n\r\nAs a collective whole, there is no fault and no one to blame for how relationships wither down.  It just happens because we don't know how to properly communicate.  But even though there is no fault of either parties, we still want to say 'I'm right and you're wrong.'\n\r\nWhen you are in a relationship with your inner self or other people, you should avoid all the second guessing.  The danger in second guessing is that you start asking yourself, \"Am I good enough?  Are they good enough?  Are we good together?  When you start doubting/second guessing, communication in a relationship is doomed to crumble.\n\r\nOne would think that communication is the problem.  However, avoiding communication is not the answer because 'cold silence atrophies any sense of compassion' toward others.\n\r\nIn a way, it is a hopeful song because the pieces of any relationship do fit together.  We know this because we watched bad communication wither them away.  If we keep rediscovering how we can strengthen communication, we can grow in all relationships.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_479": "\nThis song is not about religion! The religious aspect is being used as an analogy. Tool uses the idea of a schism to describe a break up of relationship.

But if we listen and follow that instinct, we can only strengthen it. \r\nI think that when they talk about communication, they don't mean verbal.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_481": "\nIt's a song that explains what caused two lovers to end up separating.

I'll break it down lyrically as I go.\n\nFirst the title. Like people have said, one definition of the word is a split between people due to differing beliefs. This best applies. \n\nFirst off, the song is about a relationship. Probably relating to his ex-wife at the time or writing, but wrote vaguely enough that it applies to all struggling lovers - perhaps not even intimate lovers, such as siblings etc.\n\nHe starts off by saying that he knows the pieces fit because he watched them fall away. The relationship couldn't fail if it didn't work in the first place. Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental Differing. That is sheer poetry. In a few words he explains how parts of their connection to each other have either been burnt to cinders by their passion or left to neglect and rot. He recognizes that there is a primal difference between them now that causes this. Pure intention, or the desire to love one another, will set two lovers souls in motion and begin the relationship. The intention, that pure desire to be with the other regardless of pride or ego, disintegrates  as time goes on, forcing lovers to cope and communicate their desires and arguments. The passion that brought the two lovers together now works against them, and burns a whole between them. They cannot see to reach an end [to their differences], which cripples their desire and will to communicate and heal.\n\nThen he begins to talk about the pride and ego that sets in when you've been with someone long enough. It becomes less about what's right, and more about WHO is right. He recognizes now there is no one to blame, but it doesn't mean that he didn't want to blame the other, and that their wasn't some trace amount of a destructive desire to topple the temple. He admits that even through the arguments and the desire to blame, it doesn't mean there wasn't the driving desire to fix it, why else argue and blame?\n\n Even the melody has begun to change. It becomes charged and you can feel the pump in it. The potential for motion. The next few lines are some of my favorite. The poetry that comes from the squaring off between, and the circling, is worth it. Finding beauty in the dissonance. Anyone who has had a serious fight would understand this. There is a weird desire to argue, its that misguided passion we feel. Passion is by its nature overwhelming, and there is beauty in that. Just as it set them in motion, it tosses them together violently, and they still feel the pull of it.\n\nAgain, he comes back to how the relationship used to work but has fallen apart. This is the chorus, but its also the core of the song. He comes back to the fact that it used to work and doesn't again and again, and it begins to change near the end. He knows how dangerous it is to second guess what people are doing together. Second guessing introduces doubt, and the schism grows wider, hence the doomed to crumble unless we grow (mature) and strengthen their ability to communicate with each other. \n\nObviously this is the not the case, because he go on to say that cold silence atrophies compassion. Imagine being angry with someone and not being able to reconcile it with them. Silent anger settles into bitterness, while you justify your actions and demonize theirs, thus killing your compassion for them.\n\nFinally, two lovers because \"supposed lovers\". This demonstrates that the split is finally complete, acknowledgment of a defeat. \nThe song winds down in what sounds to be like bitter regret. \"I know the pieces fit\" but they don't anymore.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_483": "\nIf there is one primary, indentifiable theme going on in Schism, it is certainly the alchemical concept most commonly known as \"squaring the circle\".  Hence, the interlude..\n\nThe poetry that comes from the squaring off between\nAnd the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance\n\nSquaring the circle is a subject that can't easily be summed up in a small article, but I'll provide some quotes to start with:\n\n\"The 'squaring of the circle' is one of the many archetypal motifs which form the basic patterns of our dreams and fantasies. But it is distinguished by the fact that it is one of the most important of them from the functional point of view. Indeed, it could even be called the archetype of wholeness.\"\n\n-Carl Jung from Mandalas (1955)\n\n\"The intent behind alchemy and the alchemical work is personal individuation, which is wholeness. In order to attain wholeness, it is said, one must square the circle... To square the circle is to see equally in the four directions, and so to be whole... To find a new equilibrium where inner, outer, above, and below are balanced and in harmony, is to be One... The viscous flame of oneness comes burning away all division of spirit and flesh, and the diamond body becomes the eternal fuel of this emancipative, destructive union.\"\n\n-Jack Haas from OM, Baby! (2005)\n\nSquaring the circle is also referred to as \"quaternity\" or \"quadratura circuli\", and is represented in countless artistic works going back to ~1000 AD (and probably before then).  It is, as Jung and Haas point out, a symbol of wholeness and balance between the inner portion of the Self (i.e. the spirit), the outer portion of the Self (i.e. the body), the heavens above, and the Earth below.\n\nThe video for Schism, in particular, brings out this theme in a way that the song by itself cannot.  It takes us through the process of purifying the mind and the body, in order to allow \"the viscous flame of oneness\" to dissolve the boundaries between spirit and matter, between male and female, between good and evil.  This is precisely what occurs in the final moments of the video.\n\nIn the beginning, we see a circular shaped metronome that bounces up from the floor and becomes suspended in the air, where it starts to oscillate back and forth.  This is symbolizing a spirit that is in a state of confusion and uncertainly, thus it sways to and fro because it cannot reach a state of calm equilibrium.  In other words, the circle has not yet been squared.\n\nWe then fade into a room that's very square-like and gray.  This represents the world of matter.. the physical realm where the spirit is held within a body.  You'll also notice there are wires that stretch across the room, symbolizing the lines of communication that are gray and stale (meaning they are not working properly, as described in the lyrics).\n\nSimilar wires are seen stretching out from a female figure's head, who now comes into frame.  Only her wires are red, meaning they are healthy and open for connection.  As she wanders around the room, she starts to sink into the floor.  At the same time, she notices an opposing male figure's feet rising up out of the floor, as if he's stuck in a state of total unconsciousness.  She pulls herself out of the sinking floor and is also able to pull the male out by his feet thereafter.  When she does this, we can see that she rotates him around on his head, forming a circle on the ground.  This expresses her desire to form a higher, spiritual connection with the man, which is clearly seen as the camera fades out and displays the two figures forming the shape of a compass.  The compass is often shown and referred to in the works of alchemists, because it metaphorically represents one of the tools that can be used in the process of squaring the circle and reaching a higher state of being.\n\nThe female then carries the still-unconscious male back to the first room we saw in the beginning, and lays him down.  She moves close to him (again, indicating a desire to communicate), reaches out toward him with her arms, and pulls them back toward herself.. like she's trying to pull him closer, but there's no wires available to hold on to.  She's just pulling at the air, and is only miming the act of connection.\n\nThe male continues to remain asleep, as he starts to drift away from the female.  She pursues him into a new room, which has a large tree-shaped crack in the wall where the male is hiding (the cracks are clearly another symbol of a breakdown in communication).  The female then begins to walk on all fours and soon, the male emerges from the crack in the wall and does the same thing.  This is symbolic of male and female communicating at a sub-human level... at the animal level.  That's why they walk on all fours.  They're not yet at a point where they can connect spiritually, so they can only connect through the flesh (i.e. matter).\n\nNow we reach a crucial point in the video, where the female moves in close to the male again (only this time they're both standing upright).  You'll notice her movements are very twitchy, again indicating that's she's vibrating at a higher frequency and desires higher-level communication.  She then grabs his ear, and pulls it out along with a rectangular chunk of his head.  This is represents the process of purifying the mind, as we later see a small goblin-like creature emerge from the extracted head piece.\n\nLater on, we see another cancerous goblin being extracted from the male's neck, symbolizing the purification of the body (in addition to the mind).  Once this occurs, the male figure becomes much more vibrant and life-like.  At the same time, the female becomes fearful and weak as she falls to the ground.  While she's lying there, the parasitic goblins start to feed off of her as they had been previously doing to the male.  Fortunately, she's strong enough to sit up and remove them from her face so that she doesn't become consumed by them.\n\nThis process of purification through bodily extraction/operation is common in strong psychedelic experiences or experiences with alien abduction.  Often, you'll read about people claiming they were operated on by aliens who extracted things from their bodies.  This also occurs during DMT and Salvia Divinorum trips, where you run into therianthropic figures who reach into your body as if to purify you and show you what is needed in order to reach a higher level of being.\n\nOnce purified, the male now grows the same red-colored wires as the female has.  They grow so fast and thick that he has to pull them away from his face.  Afterwards, the male and female turn to face each other and become merged into a single being with a large head.  Male and female (i.e. spirit and matter) have now become one, as we see the viscous flames rain down upon them, symbolizing the union of opposites.  The squaring of the circle is now complete, and the spiritual/astral Self has finally reached a state of equilibrium.  This is confirmed by the reappearance of the metronome we saw in the beginning of the video, which you'll notice is no longer oscillating back and forth.  This being has now completed the process of individuation, and is in a harmonious, balanced state of oneness.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_484": "\nIt's about War/forking/splitting, of any type; lovers separating, countries splitting up, religious sects splintering.

So different and unique...ones I'd never thought of.  \r\nIn my opinion, and many others who have researched the band and know it's history (not just \"oh man, these guys rock!\" because they sound good) - this song is about the band \"falling apart\" and then coming back together after everything negative that happened with Maynard and APC, and the band being on a very long break, they realized they were here to create music and to show people something new and different. \r\nThe album Lateralus is completely different from their earlier work - it's after Maynard met Alex Grey (amazing artist, fyi) and became more at peace.  \n\r\nKeep your third eye open, people.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_488": "\nI am really amazed by the similarities between Tool's \"Lateralus\" and Pain of Salvation's \"Be\".\n\r\nBe is all about the source of existence and more on mortal issues while Lateralus is more spiritual and doesn't care about the mundane matters. But still there are some songs that build up the progression which give the same message.\n\r\nIn the opening of Be, an entity talks to itself, wondering how did he come alive and what was before he became to \"be\". So he devises a way to learn himself better. By dividing himself in countless forms and observing them all while calling himself \"god\". This is pretty similar with parabol\u00c2\u00b6bola. In parabol, we see the mind thinking to itself as a part of that \"god\", wondering when he started to \"exist\" and looks forward for this new experience. (this god is not necessarily one of the gods in known religions. it is rather the infinity or the perfect unity)  \n\r\nIn Be, that entity enjoys this different form of unity at first but then things go wrong as those small aspects of his get separated from each other. Their motives, their opinions or their actions collide with each other so the \"schism\" occurs. In the song \"Diffidentia\" , that entity talks to himself again : \n\r\n\"Man is shattered\r\nI am shattered\r\nMy shards have become shards of their own\r\nPieces of pieces, impossible to put back together\r\nSpending their lives seeking a context they were always a part of\"\n\r\nand \n\r\n\"Searching for yourself is like looking for the house you stand in\r\nHow could you possibly find it?\r\nIt's everywhere\r\nIt's all you know\r\nAnd there are no other points of reference\"\n\r\nSo in Be, the \"god\" fails to learn about himself as his shards collide with each other endlessly, and he starts to fade as that unity is broken now.\n\r\nBut in Schism, and thus Lateralus, this unity is unshakeable. Whatever the shards do to each other, eventually they will fit again. So all the conflicts are meaningless and we should try to communicate with each other and support that unity. Conflicting with each other is like rowing your boat against a strong flow. Meaningless and painful and eventually you will be forced to stay in harmony with the flow.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_489": "\nI know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away---its about a failing relationship, and the belief it can be saved.\nMildewed and smoldering.
