{"comment_0": "\nPeople Tend To See This As A Simple Pop Punk Song. They Call It The Under Wear Song, But It Actually Has A Meaning. It's About Self Confidence And Feeling Good About Yourself And Your Body. What Better Way To Say It Than \"You Look So Perfect Standing There In My America Apparel Underwear.\" It Gets Straight To The Point. This Song Actually Has A Meaning, It's Not Another One Of Those Stupid Meaningless Pop Songs.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
