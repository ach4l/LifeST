{"comment_0": "\nFirst song I've heard by this guy and it is really a great song. I can't relate to the topic cause my boyfriend is amazing, but Blake Shelton's voice in this song is so powerful and passionate that I can't help but sing along with it when it comes on the radio. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\ni heard this song and loved it right away. its so true. when your with someone for a while you start to take them for granted like he did and then you always regret it. its a wake up call to treat the person your with the best you can so you dont have to regret.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
