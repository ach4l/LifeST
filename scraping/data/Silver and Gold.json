{"comment_0": "\nBurl is sooooooo long dead and the lyrics can't be displayed? Even when others have covered this song? Geesh! This is one of the best Christmas songs ever written. Ever. And Burl was one of the masters of holiday music. I'm heartbroken. NOT a good way to begin a day. (Man, I have an idea...I'll post the song lyrics to Silver and Gold by one of the artists who covered Burl Ives...and then there shouldn't be a problem:) There are ways around the law:) \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
