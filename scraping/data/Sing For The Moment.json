Eminem makes songs that are easy to listen to, I'll agree.  But he's not a musician, and I don't think he's overly talented.  I mean, rap in general has no musical value whatsoever, as it's prettymuch all repetitive computer generated drumbeats and some simple synthesized bass.  So to call Eminem, or any rapper for that matter, a musical genius is a farce.  But since they have no musical value, their strength has to be in their lyrics and vocal talent.  To be honest, Eminem can't sing.  He more or less talks to a beat, he doesn't sing.  And his lyrics are mainly him bitching about everything, in normal prose.  Once again, no musical value.  He's not a lyricist, he just writes long satirical rants about how the world is too mean to him.  It flows extremely well, I'll give you that, but there's no deeper meaning, no metaphors, nothing.  If you guys think that this is among the best that music has to offer, I honestly pity you.  There's so much more out there, so much actual musical talent.

Either way, I maintain that the point he was making in that part of the song is that he's getting alot of bs from suburban holier-than-thou parents \"whose worst fear is a child with died hair and  who wears earrings\". If the parents would actually explain to their kids why not to listen to this or that kind of music instead of using up all their energy nagging and finger-wagging they might actually have a chance. And that is  what the song is about;  Em's childhood as he growing up with authoritarian self-righteous bastards for parents and that he now wants to send a wake-up call to overbearing parents to tell them that if they force their ideas and beliefs on  their kids too much that rebellion is inevetible\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_79": "\nby ab0ve on 05-28-2002 @ 05:22:11 AM  \r\nI think this and Halie's Song are the best two songs Eminem has made.

Police say Eminem struck a man - club bouncer John Guerrera - he says he saw kissing his estranged wife, Kim.
