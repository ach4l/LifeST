{"comment_0": "\nIt doesn't surprise me that people would really turn this toward religion. As against religion as Maynard or the band may be, i don't get that from this song.\n\r\nBeing someone who struggled with different addictions i can definitely relate to every line in this song. \n\r\n\"There's a shadow just behind me,\r\nShrouding every step I take,\r\nMaking every promise empty,\r\nPointing every finger at me.\"\n\r\nDrug/Alcohol addiction promises alot but there is always a price. People get high to feel good. However, You will feel empty when you aren't high, but you will be judged when you are. Hence the reason it makes \"every promise empty and pointing every finger at me\"\n\r\n\"Waiting like a stalking butler\r\nWho upon the finger rests.\r\nMurder now the path called \"must we\"\r\nJust before the son has come.\"\n\n\r\nAddiction stands like a butler that follows you and like a butler it promises to help you through your day and the analogy of the butler on the finger as a way to use. Alot of drugs will lay on your finger especially if your snorting.\n\r\n\"The path called 'must we'\" references to me the \"Rules of the world\". Kind of a Damned if you do Damned if you don't kind of thing. Addictions will tell the user that they need to not be concerned with what \"needs to be done\". Just sit back and use/drink/smoke/whatever.\n\r\n\"Jesus wont you Fucking Whistle\r\nSomething but the past and done\r\nJesus won't you Fucking whistle\r\nSomething but the past and done\"\n\r\nReaching out for answers but feeling like your past is the reason you won't ever find forgiveness or peace.(I mean come on how many of us have felt the negative effects of a night drinking/partying/smoking/whatever and gotten sick and cried out to God even if you don't believe he exists. \"God if you get me out of this i'll never drink again\".)  Asking \"Jesus if you are real all i want is a whistle\" or \"God if you are real now would be the time to show it\".\n\r\n\"Why can't we not be sober?\r\nI just want to start this over.\r\nWhy can't we drink forever.\r\nI just want to start things over.\"\n\r\nThis is the argument every person has at one time or another during their time of addiction. (if you haven't then congrats you are the first i've ever heard of.)\n\r\n\"I am just a worthless liar.\r\nI am just an imbecile.\r\nI will only complicate you.\r\nTrust in me and fall as well.\r\nI will find a center in you.\r\nI will chew it up and leave,\r\nI will work to elevate you\r\nJust enough to bring you down.\"\n\r\nThe reality of what our addictions bring in the end. And i'm not talking about the recreational or social users, i'm talking about the ADDICTS who need it. Those who cant function in their day without whatever their addiction is. (i'm not condemning, i was there at one point too and i know how that battle goes.)\n\r\nSo there's my take. it's all based on personal experience so i could be way off. I'm not personal friends with the band so obviously i can't say this is what they meant, but when i listen to this song, this is what it tells me.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nMaynard creates a character that epitomizes self hatred.\n\r\nThis song to me paints a picture of the loop this man gets caught in, where he hates himself, and absolutely wallows in it. Instead of looking for change, he persists in this stubborn cycle of nostalgia and depression. He just wants to start it over, but he's too fucked up by now to do it.\n\r\nThis is one of the only Tool songs that i don't see the \"light at the end of the tunnel\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nAs numerous people have said before, yes, the chorus is a double-negative. \"Why can't we not be sober\" is the equivalent of \"Why can't we just be drunk\". I don't know if anyone else said this already, but I think Maynard was being clever with this song; the narrator is a drunk and a selfish hypocrite. Yes, he is an alcoholic. The shadow behind him is his CONSCIENCE. It follows him everywhere no matter how much he drinks and \"points every finger at him\" (AKA he knows he is responsible for his own faults, but will not accept it). \"I just want to start this over\" refers to his excuse for drinking, he wants to lose himself in the liquor and \"start over\", or in reality act like all his problems don't exist. He knows he is just a worthless liar, and is not willing to do anything about it. Everyone who has ever cared about him, he only made their lives more complicated by causing them the pain of watching his addiction consume him; they trusted him to take care of himself, but he let them down (trust in me and fall as well). The people who loved him watched as he destroyed himself (I will find a center in you, I will chew it up and leave), and despite numerous attempts at rehab, no matter how good things looked, he always reverted back to drinking (I will work to elevate you, just enough to bring you down). \"Trust me\" is a contradiction to what he clearly says earlier (trust in me and fall as well), he tells other people to trust him, that he can take care of himself, when clearly he cannot. \"I want what I want\" reinforces how selfish he is, he doesn't care that he's hurting others by hurting himself, he wants to drink and he will continue to do so. Its a sad story in my eyes. There's lots of people like that in real life I think. Of course this is just my interpretation though.

Rather than being \"sober\" from alcohol, it could mean from the sexual urge.\n\r\nIn the first verse he talks about this urge. \"Every promise empty\" as in empty promises to women. The urge haunts him like a \"stalking butler\" that makes him do all sorts of sleazy things.\n\r\nIn the second verse, he warns others against himself  while he is under the influence of this urge. This is evident in every single line of the verse. Especially so in \"I will find a center in you\" -- straight up innuendo right there. \"I will chew it up and leave\" refers to one night stands. \"I will work to elevate you just enough to bring you down\" -- again, get the girl emotionally worked up just to get sex and leave her upset.\n\r\nThat being said, the references to Jesus and Mary make perfect sense. Christianity places an emphasis in chasity, further personifying the speaker's sexual urge as a demon. In other words, faith places a guilt on the speaker.\n\r\n\"Murder now the path called 'must we' just before the son has come\" -- sex is something \"we must\" do, are we supposed to give it up in the name of Christianity, just because the son has come?\n\r\n\"Jesus won't you fucking whistle\" -- whistle and ignore the promiscuity, to being indifferent to it rather than condemn it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nI think it's about falling back on alcohol when something goes wrong and all seems lost and hopeless and there's no one to blame but yourself not even your religious figures have the answers for your faults.

For instance, consider some of the verses such as:\n\r\n\"There's a shadow just behind me,\r\nShrouding every step I take,\"\n\r\nThis is referring to his military schooling such as Basic Training and the people he would have had to deal with there.\n\r\nRead these lyrics:\n\r\n\"Making every promise empty,\r\npointing every finger at me.\"\n\r\nThese lyrics are saying that he had to deal with a lot crap from his officers while they trainied him to become a soldier.\n\n\r\nSo, in a lot of ways, being in the military is like not being sober, it is an overwhelming state of mind to be in. This song was written not too long after he left his career in the army, and it is about reflections on life in the military and being happy about being a civilian. \n\r\nBut you can look at it from the other way too. Who are we to be sober? Being sober is just a state of mind, and there are many states of mind. Shouldn't we experience other states of mind as well? We typically experience sobriety when we are clam and relaxed. Maynard may not have experience a calm and relaxing environment in the military. Perhaps he is distinguishing states of mind depending on situations. We sometimes have to go through a lot of situations, and perhaps, in an effort to keep the human population under control by our government, we are encouraged to aspire to become sober. In this sober, being sober is a means of population control.\n\r\nWe are left without answers, but at least we can now distinguish between different situations, environments, and states of mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_16": "\nDefinitely about addiction and how it lets everyone around you down, hurts your loved ones\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nI think this song is about someone with a personality disorder, telling traits at each line..i mean borderline or narcissitic personality disorders.(BPD-NPD)\n\r\n''There's a shadow just behind me,\r\nShrouding every step i take''\n\r\nhe talks about his diseased character, his feelings of emptiness like a shadow behind. and he cannot live his life normally becouse every step he takes is related with the feelings and stress coused by NPD/BPD\n\r\n''making every promise empty''\n\r\nas he goes his way, the things he does just for himself cant make him feel better forever. this is only a temporary satisfaction until he comes acroos anotherone who he thinks is overly critical again* \n\r\n''pointing every finger at me'' \n\r\nthis is both about the people he this they are overly critical, and also about his isolation. he feels he is not one of them\n\r\n''Waiting like a stalking butler\r\nwho upon the finger rests.''\n\r\nit is again about his disease, his inside world and instincts\n\r\n''Jesus, won't you fucking whistle\r\nsomething but the past and done?''\n\r\njesus here means the true sight of himself, he knows deep inside that he is not as precious as he shows himself to other people. he doestnt want to remember about his past and what he has done which indicates his reality. he denies his cravings for fear of \"losing face\" .\n\r\n''Why can't we not be sober?''\r\n''Why can't we drink forever''\n\r\nalcoholism and other addictions are the result of his personality disorder:the result of self-medication to deal with the emotional pain of his disorder. it takes his mind off his inherent limitations, inevitable failures, painful and much-feared rejections, and the grandiosity gap - the abyss between the image he projects (the false Self) and the injurious truth. drinking  relieves his anxiety and resolve the tension between his unrealistic expectations and inflated self-image \n\r\n''I am just a worthless liar.\r\nI am just an imbecile.''\n\r\nhe talks about his pathological lying trait which is also common in personality disorders.\n\n\r\n''I will only complicate you.\r\nTrust in me and fall as well.''\n\r\nthese are the words that he cant say out loud to his new victims. these is how he thinks when he fools someone.\n\r\n''I will find a center in you.\r\nI will chew it up and leave''\n\r\nthis is obviously about manipulating trait of his personality disorder. that he is not in a real relationship with others, just using them for his temporary satisfaction.\n\r\n''I will work to elevate you\r\njust enough to bring you down''\n\r\nand this is another typical behavioual trait of especially borderline personality disorder. they see everything black and white : splitting, in which a person or thing is seen as all good or all bad. that something which is all good one day can be all bad the next, which is related to another symptom: borderlines have problems with object constancy in people -they read each action of people in their lives as if there were no prior context; they don't have a sense of continuity and consistency about people and things in their lives. they have a hard time experiencing an absent loved one as a loving presence in their minds.\n\r\n''Mother Mary won't you whisper\r\nsomething but what's past and done''\n\r\nthis is probably about the mother figure , the superego again judging him.\n\r\n''I want what i want''\n\r\nthis tells lack of  empathy. he is only he  is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others.\n\n\r\n''turst me..trust me''\n\r\nthis is his wiling about finding new victims who feed him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_18": "\ntheir music vids are kinda creepy to sum ppl....but to me...this one....is sad,it doesnt scare me at all cuz EVRYONE pretty much has a special box and that poor little creature has nuthing in its box. its sad if yoou think about it. he has NO memories in his box,nuthing. but ya i LUV this song. i can go to sleep with this stuff on,idk just sumthing with his voice makes me relaxed. but hooker with a  penis is my #1 song this is my second fav.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_19": "\nThis song is obviously talking about the unconscious mind. In the music video the creature has a box that it wants to open and look into. The box represent the unconsciousness. Now the part saying \"why can't we not be sober\" is referring to why can't we always be looking into our unconscious mind. Instead we must dwell in this form of reality through which our unconscious mind portrays. And then the song starts saying\n\r\n \"I am just a worthless liar.\r\nI am just an imbecile.\r\nI will only complicate you.\r\nTrust in me and fall as well.\r\nI will find a center in you.\r\nI will chew it up and leave,\r\nI will work to elevate you\r\njust enough to bring you down\"\n\r\nThis is describing what would happen if we look into our unconscious mind. It will lie to us it is an imbecile because it is your unconscious mind the things you see in it will only complicate you and not make any sense at all. if you believe in what you see in the unconscious mind it will bring you down because all of it will be fake. it will find the most important  meaning for you and chew it to shreds and drop you down as it lifted your insight.\n\r\nAnd so when we are not sober we would always be dwelling in our unconscious mind and it would eventually be our only form of reality since we would lose our knowledge of the reality which we experience now.\n\r\nWe see reality through what our unconsciouness portrays through our eyes. So we see reality in a \"straight line\". If we look into our unconsciouness we will see all the possibilities our reality and humanly existence could have and we see all the outcomes of what could have happened in this reality we look at a part of history and see every single possibility and other thing that could have occured in that time and existence. So we basically see everything that happens EVER or could have happened. we see all of time and its possible outcomes.we see everything that is and could have existed or happened.\r\nso if we were to not be sober to this whole knowledge base existence or whatever this feeling would be called then our own reality wouldn't be holding us down to only one outcome of time and existence.\r\nwe see every why if possiblity outcome and answer.  What our reality and we we expierence everyday is only one of our outcomes of life and time existence. But in our mind we experience ever point of reality and outcome of time and existence.\n\r\nNow that is just my theory of sober. There were also partial meanings to other songs in here.And i think this is why why tool sings. Because somehow their songs open up our mind and we each can perceive a different meaning in each of their songs.\r\nIf you did not completly understand this then you obviously have a closed mind and will never experience what is listed in what i wrote up above.

Being an addict myself, this illustrates the emotions, the hollowness, and that sinking desire/need to pull back to your best of chemical friends. No one wants to be one, and great people, sometimes surprisingly the deepest, most profound ones this Earth has housed, get taken by a substance.

Instead of believing in old dogma, we should be thinking for ourselves.  Looking inward for the answers.\n\r\n(It's interesting to note that I think you could include the ego as something that gets in the way of our intuition.  It feeds us lies about ourselves).  \n\r\nThe 'shadow' and 'stalking butler' describe religion (or the old dogma).  It's like a shadow because it is always with you, dictating your decisions.  Any religion can be a 'stalking butler' that takes care of your every need, but rapes you of your own ability to think.  Further, he's saying that religion murders the 'path of 'must we''.  I think this means that before the 'son' (Christ or any other old diety) came, we thought in a world of 'must we' or possibility...must we do this?  must we do that?\"\n\r\nHe goes on to ask Jesus and Mary if they can tell us something other that what is 'past and done.'  Is there anything new that they can give us?  Again, I think he's talking about religion as an EXAMPLE of anything that gets in the way of your intuition.\n\r\nI think 'Why can't we not be sober?\" simply asks the question, \"Why can't we just drink in the new life of possibility everyday?\"  Why can't we just start over, and think for ourselves?  Why do we have to be 'sober' (or follow the rules) like everyone else tells us we should?  Why can't we live by the beat of our own drum?  Why can't we be 'drunk' in the present moment?\n\r\n'I am just a worthless liar' to 'Trust me' is from religion's voice.  It's basically telling us the qualities of religion (worthless liar, imbecile, a complication, etc.).  Trust in it, and you'll fall down.  Religion will find a place inside your heart (instead of your own intuitive voice), and it will 'chew you up and leave.'  It gets inside, chews you up, and leaves you empty.  It pushes your divine self aside.\n\r\nAt the end, he concludes, 'I want what I want.'  Meaning, I want to do whatever I want to do.  I don't want anything to tell me otherwise.  My intuition is correct, and it will guide me.  My inner soul (and not the external world) will guide me.\n\r\nTo me, this song is very much like Lateralus.  It encourages us to feed our will to live in the moment.  Applying old laws and regulations from other people withers away our own ability to decide what we want to do with our lives.  I definitely don't think it's bashing religion.  It's bashing anything that gets in the way of us believing we are divine creatures that can do anything our inner voice tells us.\n\r\nThat's my two cents anyway :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_22": "\nWe used to play this with our band, just to see who were musicians, and who were \"regular\" crowd.\nThe regular crowd went to the bar when we started playing this, the musicians came toward the stage.\nStill an awesome song to play, just because of the emotions we could put into it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_23": "\nThe over analysis here is ridiculous.

He is saying \"WHY cant we not be sober\" as a reference that we need to all start to open our third eye.  He also talks about his shadow again in this song, which right there tells he wants to enter the third level.  He just wants to start things over, just become another race.

That's why he says \"Trust me,\" because they're backing away from him. He just wants them to understand. You know, like those drug addicts who want people to \"try it\" because it makes everything better. He turns to God to get rid of his problems, or possibly the people who want him to sober up keep lecturing about God. In the end, when he says \"I want what I want,\" I've said that before. I've said it when I've just wanted to be left alone. Where I just want to see things the way I want to see things, but everyone is trying to make me see differently.

I think that one should worship what they when they want. \r\nAlso as people state that they have a favorite tool song, I found that I was saying that for almost every song of their's but for different reasons.

His state of mind is seen as evil by society around him.  Therefore he feels almost as if the devil has consumed his view on the world.  How he sees the world is not the same as everyone else sees the world.  He is a deviant man with deviant thoughts.  So since his way appears to be in the minority in society, he may question his sanity.  Thus further producing more feelings of melancholy of various capacities.   \n\r\n\tAlso to be considered that contributed to Maynard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s melancholy is the fact of conditioning as a kid.  He was brought up Christian and the idea of the devil or Satan has been conditioned into his head with feelings of melancholy/hate.  So every time he thinks of how deviant he is, by societies definition, he is a walking devil.  Thinking about the devil as a kid has carried with him as he thinks of himself being the deviant devilish creature.  Thus producing the feelings of melancholy that are unconsciously associated with thinking of the devil.  But Maynard cannot get rid of that old conditioning.  Leaving him depressed and wishing he could be like everyone else(unconscious happy creatures) as seen in the last quote at the bottom.  \n\r\n\"Why can't we not be sober?\"  (Yes there is a double negative) \r\nMeaning: I am sick of thinking this way it is too depressing.  Cant I just erase my manifestation and be like everyone else?  Because it seems way easier.  He says this because of the melancholy he feels being the deviant person in the western world.  \r\nHe asks that because he \"just want to start this over.\"\r\nmeaning:  having his insanity never manifest into his head.

The tendancy that he and some people have to promise much, but deliver little. As the voice has nothing but good intentions, he cannot see how empty promises hurt, which \"feels\" like somebody is forcing his hand to break those promises. \n\r\n>Murder now the path called \"must we\"\r\n>just before the son has come.\r\n>Jesus, won't you fucking whistle\r\n>something but the past and done?\r\n-This is the voice blaming God/Jesus/Church for forsaking him, giving him no shelter from his current pain, which he feels from the broken promises mentioned erlier. \n\r\n>Why can't we not be sober?\r\n>I just want to start this over.\r\n-Sober means \"not on drugs\" but it can also mean \"clear of mind\". According to Marx \"Religion is the opium of the masses\", seeing it that way, sober in this instance could mean \"without religion\". So \"Why can't we not be sober?\" is a plea to rid ourselves from religion.\n\r\n>Why can't we drink forever.\r\n>I just want to start things over.\r\n-This and the last verse are always linked, but when they are not it brings new meaning. I have heard a cliche which goes something like \"Drink the knowledge in\". Using that, the voice is speaking of drinking from knowledge, forsaking the crutch of religion. \n\r\n>I am just a worthless liar.\r\n>I am just an imbecile.\r\n>I will only complicate you.\r\n>Trust in me and fall as well.\r\n>I will find a center in you.\r\n>I will chew it up and leave,\r\n>I will work to elevate you\r\n>just enough to bring you down.\r\n-Here he voice is speaking to, for an example _only_, a christian. He is saying from that point of view he is a worthless liar, an imbecile, etc, etc. Also it serves as a warning to christians, still using the example, as he will degrate them and chew them up. Also, it is another attempt to remind himself of the promises broken.\n\r\n>Trust me.\r\n-*double meaning alert* Linking this with the previous verse it is used as a warning to christians as in; \"Trust me when I say I'll chew you up and spit you out.\". _BUT_ on it's own, it is a plea for the sane to embrace life and forget religion, which from the moment of inception is dying. \n\r\n>Mother Mary won't you whisper\r\n>something but what's past and done.\r\n-See \"Jesus\" line above. This is the lyric that keeps my third eye trained on interpreting this song as \"the voice\" vs. \"the church\".\n\r\n>Trust me.\r\n-See above.\n\r\n>Why can't we not be sober?\r\n>I just want to start this over.\r\n-See above.\n\r\n>Why can't we sleep forever.\r\n>I just want to start things over.\r\n- Now for the only alternative to \"with God\" or \"without God\" that the voice sees as a good one, to sleep forever. This could mean one of three things, all opposing:\r\n1. Sleep forever meaning \"being dead\", which with the hope of the lyric \"Trust me\" doesn't quite make sense.\r\n2. Sleep forever meaning \"being dead\", and bring new hope by cleaning all the dead brains out of the mix.\r\n3.  Sleep forever meaning \"dream forever\", which is the only alternative left, sit in dreamstate, accomplishing nothing.\n\r\n>I want what I want.\r\n- to quote Issac Asimov: \"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time.\" \r\nMeaning, I don't have to explain myself. For a better example, think of a parent saying in retort to a child \"Because I said so.\"\n\r\nThanks for reading this and I don't think this meaning has been yet been posted.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_123": "\nWe are all just sharing opinions that's all we have.

I know many people looking for alot of hidden meanings in Maynard's lyrics but in many songs i think he comes out and says everything he has to say clearly and simply. And lets not forget that Tool is made up of three other individuals who all contribute in their own way to the meaning of the songs they write, namely Adam, Danny and Justin. Even Maynard himself said in an interview 'the music should always come first. If the words were so important and the music wasn't then people would be doing sold out spoken word tours.' I think their main concern is the music and the lyrics sort of point out where the emotion is pointing towards. However in Sober the chords seem rigid and Harsh as is the case with many other early tool songs (undertow, hush). The song is an angry song more than anything else and it is obvious that the anger is pointed at Christ. We tool fans all know how they feel about religion and christianity already.\n\n\r\nThere's a shadow just behind me,\r\nShrouding every step i take,\r\nmaking every promise empty,\r\npointing every finger at me.\r\n(In these lines the persona feels like he is being stalked by God. As iif God is waiting for him do make a wrong move only to point the finger of blame at him when he does.)\n\r\nWaiting like a stalking butler\r\nwho upon the finger rests.\r\n(Again with the stalking presence he feels from God watching watching him. However the second line points to him feeling that God deserves all of the blme for making him imperfectly)\n\r\nMurder now the path called \"must we\"\r\njust before the son has come.\r\n(the narrator saying that after Jesus come we have no choice but to follow or to be damned.)\n\r\nJesus, won't you fucking whistle\r\nsomething but the past and done?\r\n(Basically him cursing and challenging Jesus to tell him something he doesnt know already. The ultimate insult to God as he is an all knowing being. If you listen to the entire song these lines are the angriest, the loudest and the clearest while the rest of the song is almost murmered and muttered with the exception of the second and third chorus) \n\r\nWhy can't we not be sober?\r\nI just want to start this over.\r\nWhy can't we drink forever.\r\nI just want to start things over.\r\n(Him challenging God saying why can't we just be drunk. Drunkeness in the eyes of christianity is a grievious sin. Maynard could also be pointing to christianity as a form of drunkeness.)\n\r\nI am just a worthless liar.\r\nI am just an imbecile.\r\nI will only complicate you.\r\nTrust in me and fall as well.\r\n(this entire verse is a two way conversation between the persona and God. The first Half above is the persona listing all of his faults to God saying if God trusts in him he may sink to his lowliness as well.)\n\r\nI will find a center in you.\r\nI will chew it up and leave,\r\nI will work to elevate you\r\njust enough to bring you down.\r\n(God telling him that he will make him rise out of his current state. However the last two lines show that the persona believes that if he trusts in God in the end it will just lead to his destruction.)\n\r\nTrust me.\n\r\nMother Mary won't you whisper\r\nsomething but what's past and done.\r\n(Same line except directed at Mary, mother of God)\n\r\nTrust me.\n\r\nI want what I want.\r\n(The persona decides that he will do what he wants to do and live the way he wants to live.)\n\r\nIn short the whole song is Tool laughing at the religious who keep their faith in God, while he believes that christianity is merely a hindrance on their intellectual growth. Don't believe me listen to Eulogy, The Patient, Opiate, Judith (APC), and many other tool songs. However i believe that all interpretations of the song may have some relevance. If you really want to know next time you see maynard, danny, adam or justin walking down the street ask them and maybe they wontfuck with your mind more.\r\nThats my two cents. peace.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_150": "\nok like idk if u guys have noticed but ever since tool maynard has hinted something about his past and a special some1 becuz in sober it seems he is talking about a realtionship saying \"i am just a worthless liar i am just an imbecile i will only elevate you long enough to bring u down \" so hes saying i am just a liar i am an idiot i will only make u happy long enough for me to do something to make u sad and i think hes afraid to commeit because he still feels for another girl\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_151": "\nI dont want to diss anyones opinion i merely want to add to the common cause of finding out what this song means\r\nMy Opinions are that: \r\n1)a close friend of tools' has turned into a Junkie/drunk. \r\n2)Tool has structured the song in a particular way so that the song is the Junkie/drunk singing about himself truthfully. \r\n3)The Part from 'I am just a worthless liar' to 'just enough to bring u down' emplys that this junkie/drunk rips people up emotionally and doesn't care because he's ignorantly blissful on his high\r\n4) The questions 'why cant we not be sober' and 'why cant we drink forever' emply that he wants to continue drinking and deny reality (for lack of a better word).

His arm starts flapping around, emplying that the junkie/drunk is desperately trying to deny reality by staying high, and then comes down from the buzz and then the arm suddenly stops flapping.

I am sure there are more Poe references, but I did not catch any more blatant than those two.  \n\r\nIt seems to me that when you combine what others have said about the lyrics and what the video is about, the song is about a person being haunted by their past, most likely guilt for a past crime (sin?).  Both of the Poe stories main characters are haunted by guilt.  The man in the Tell-Tale heart believes that he is hearing the heartbeat of the man he killed (it was actually his own heart) that he reveals his crime.  The man who buried the other man alive in The Cask of Amontillado revealed his crime on his deathbed, after letting it stew and haunt him his entire life.\n\r\nSo its about being haunted by your past, in my opinion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_184": "\nI agree with treestump.

Song interpretation is always open to the listener, but of course the artist had an original intention. The clues are there, in the title. \"sober\" in the lyrics. \"Theres a shadow just behind me\"\n\r\nThere are double negitives which further point to meaning \"Why can't we not be be sober\" otherwise put as \"Why do I have to be sober\" however many will read that as why cant I be sober.\n\r\nYou see this is a song, as maynard said about a friend who had a drinking problem, that is the shadow behind him, the song is about drink or drugs, the song is sung from two points of view, one of the person and one of the drink or drug. hence the \"we\" in there, moreso the song is sung from the perspective of the alcohol or drug.\n\r\nkeep this in mind and re-read the lyrics, it makes amazing sense. Some key phrases\n\r\n\"I will find a center in you.\r\nI will chew it up and leave,\r\nI will work to elevate you\r\njust enough to bring you down\"\n\r\nThe first 2 lines are the general perception of drugs, they will find a part of you latch on, and tear your life apart.\n\r\nI will work to elivate you, that is simple poetic arrangment, for \"I will make you high\" just enough to bring you down, well what happens to most drug addicts or alcoholics, they crash and burn!\n\r\nI could disect every line if you like but the meanings really aren't that hard to pull out. The religious undertow to the song, which is of course there, is relevant but think of it more along the lines of AA \n\r\nand so on and so on!

In March 1986, Maynard formed a band called Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty (C.A.D.) with another guy named Kevin Horning. They made an album called Fingernails with 13 tracks on it, mostly experimental stuff and noise collages. It's not very good, but everyone's gotta start somewhere. Fingernails, apparently, is now widely available on the Internet in MP3 format.\n\r\nAnyway, after Fingernails, C.A.D. added three more members: Todd Horning (Kevin Horning's brother, second guitar), Stan Henderson (really tall and strong freaky-looking black dude, on bass), and Tom Geluso (some other dude, on drums - on Fingernails, Maynard used a drum machine because they didn't have a drummer). Anyways, they recorded another album in early 1987 called Dog.House, which is extremely rare. Very, VERY few copies are known to exist, and, unlike Fingernails, cannot be found anywhere on the internet. It shows up occasionally on eBay every now and then for upward of $100. There was this really nice guy who owned a copy of Dog.House and posted the tracklist on his website, but I'm too tired to try and find the link (don't worry, Google it, you'll find it easily).\n\r\nAnyway, there was this one track on Dog.House called \"Waiting for the World\", which contains most of the lyrics from Sober, but with a very different melody. Therefore, this means that Maynard must have written these lyrics before April 1987, and possibly even in late 1986. The earliest recorded version of Sober (with the melody and everything), was in 1991, on the \"72826\" demo tape, which can be found on YouTube (search for \"72826\"). Also, here's a video of C.A.D. from their only concert ever, on April 17, 1987 (which, coincedentally, was the date of Nirvana's first-ever concert and Maynard's 23rd birthday) at the Peace Day event in Grand Rapids, Michigan (where Maynard lived from 1986-1987). However, I must warn you, this was the 80's, and you'll never look at Maynard the same way after you watch it:\n\nyoutube.com/\u2026\n\r\nIt's them (with Todd Horning, Henderson, and Geluso), performing \"Mandango Lover\", the third track from Dog.House. Enjoy.\n\r\nAnyway, I just wanted to tell you all the history of Sober's lyrics.

The slower section \"I am just a worthless liar....\" is the narrator struggling with one's own power, or perhaps even tricking the audience to seem as though Maynard wouldn't want people to follow him while that might be exactly his goal as after the last time Maynar sings that section he repeats \"trust me\" which is up in the air, it could be a sardonic take on Jesus's words, giving in to the will to influence others, both, or the mindset during whatever inspired the song lyrics taking over the narrator, shouting over what could have been individuality, or it could be the major cataylst for Maynard's will to define himself as an individual, or again, both.\n\r\nWe don't don't definitely what Tool's songs are actually about.

Similar to many drinking experience that we have all had that are well intended, and are at times used as means to forget about problems in previous relationships, we can see our new relationships going into the same downward spiral as the old ones, which in turn can give you a sobering feeling, one that you wish would just go away.  So in many respects it is a very cyclical phenomenon.  We get into new relationships to forget about old ones, then find ourselves making the same mistakes as we did in the previous one.  The sobering effect only makes you yearn to start a new and forget about the past.  But in the end we realize that it is better to stay sober, and try to learn from our mistakes and hopeful learn from them instead of forgetting about them. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_295": "\nOkay, I've read a lot of good ideas about the meaning of these lyrics and here is my take on two versus in particular. \"Jesus blow your *** whistle sometime before the past and done\" Okay, to me and the reference to \"Mother Mary won't you whisper sometime before the past and done\" is a hint pointing to the writer's Catholic upbringing and wondering why he was never stopped, \"supernaturally\", from making the bad decision that ruined his life in the first place. The whisper from Mary being mostly a Catholic thing, as Catholics put Mary on a level near Jesus. So, Jesus didn't \"supernaturally\" intervene and stop him from making the BIG mistake that he wishes he could take back. And Mary didn't do her part and \"whisper\" any words of warning for him to head before the past and done, so basically he's saying that he was allowed to go past the point of no return and, of course, blames his \"Higher Power\" for letting him learn a lesson the hard way. I'm not a Catholic but a christian, nonetheless, and I say Jesus has been blowing the whistle ever since he arrived. His message, in the  case of the writer, has fallen on deaf ears or else he could have been saved from himself before it was too late. I believe others have accurately surmised the rest of the lyrics as they pertain to the sin of \"consumption\". This song is like a cry for help that was never heard- the resulting loss of this man's soul.

As the son of devout Catholics, I can say with certainty that it is easy to go against your parent's beliefs as you become more mentally privileged than they ever were.

Maynard never leaves anything as a single meaning, and this song among almost all the others has a double meaning. The first verse is a reflection of an inner self, the side of us all that only speaks of our every weakness, breaks down our self esteem with all our faults and fears. Maynard is very human as he has informed us many times, and he is always trying to connect with the rest of humanity on the deepest and most sincere levels. Its key that that this is apart of himself when he refers to it as a shadow that \"shrouds every step he takes.\" The chorus is most profound, as he begs the question we've all felt but maybe not put into words: why do we as humans, feel the need to be inebriated- not plainly with alcohol, that's simply a metaphor to get the point across- why is being sober so painful? People who have never done drugs may say that they are simply fine without them and never felt better- but they probably don't understand that every piece of fruit, meat, vegetables, or ANY kind of edible source they intake changes their chemistry in someway. Drugs are no different, it is just a much more vibrant effect. But no doubt to those of us who have experimented, life feels like eternal bliss when we are not sober, and that is the grand message of the song. The dark dissonance beautifully compliments this theme, and really had me re-appreciate it all together.

I just want to start this over. Why can't we drink forever.I just want to start things over.\"- the double negative reflects how the addict complicates things, he manipulates his words to make his point seem like what it is not. He wants to \"start this over\" but his addictive side keeps coming around tricking him into wanting to \"drink forever\", constantly quenching his thirst for the drug. I know there were plenty of times in our relationship when my ex would manipulate his words & situations, etc, in ways to make me believe the wrong thing or do something for his benefit. It's what he was best at & he would manipulate even without realizing it until after & he manipulate himself.\n\r\n\"I am just a worthless liar.\r\nI am just an imbecile.\"- obviously, self-loathing because of the person he has become b/c of the addiction\r\n\"I will only complicate you.

He told me straightforward coming into the relationship that he would only give me trouble & that I do not understand addiction. I thought I would be able to help him, I wanted to be with him but I also wanted to be the person who brought him out the hole he dug himself in but I was wrong. He got to know me & I opened myself up to him & let him in & he saw how vulnerable & naive I was but also that I was a good person with compassion & care & giving so he took advantage of my kindness at a time when he didn't have a support system. He told me things & made me feel like I was at the top of the world but after rehab he fell out of love (thought he believed it was drug-induced the entire time) & even though he found he had feelings for me, we broke up & he decided it would be best to cut me off completely. Instead of taking responsibility for his actions, he turned the tables on me once again & described me as a burden to him & he needed to let go of me since we used together (though we only both used pot) to let go of the memories, even though memories dont just go like that, they stay. If anything he was weight I was always carrying, I was always trying to give to him & be there for him. Everything I did was for him, that is what he wanted & he got it because I trusted him. It is a constant struggle for him, between himself & his addicted self. He's always juggling between what he wants & what his addicted side wants. He may not have wanted to cause me such harm but I trusted in him & he knew it would be inevitable. I has caused many people close to him harm but most of the time it was unintentional. That's just how it came to be. But now he is recovering & coming out of that past life & finally picking himself up again.\n\r\nI'm sure a lot of people will disagree with this interpretation but just thought I'd share my story & how it fits.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_328": "\nThose are the lyrics from toolband.com .... but Maynard changes the lyrics in the album version a lot if you listen to it. so some of undertow is different.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_329": "\nI haven't read all comments, but this is what I think since I first heard this song (circa 2002).\n\nThis song is about someone who doesnt like the way his 'self' works naturally (or sober).

He gets upset over his imperfections, and, in a rage, he blames his deities for making him that way. \n\nIt is a great performance by the singer, you can feel the displeasure in his voice.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_330": "\nThis song is about religion. By 'sober' he means sober from the bullshit religion has put in our minds.

Not evidence as in nature or overcoming illness, REAL evidence. Not fake miracles, the real ones ones from the Bible. Just like once every hundred years, God, just to make sure we are still on the same page. Show your face for once! Jesus, whisper in my ear that you're actually still out there!

But no. \n\nSo you sit in awe of what the world could have been had it not been for that cursed plague called religion, poisoning the minds of humanity and leeching the hope of what we could have been, out of us forever.

They're pretty deep feelings in themseleves, and I don't think they really have a lot to do with religion at all. Every time a biblical figure is mentioned, everyone makes the entire song about it. It's just about a sad man, maybe even himself or an exaggeration of himself.\n\r\nHe has a shadow (drug addiction, mental disorder, bad history) that follows behind him and helps him behave in a way many would consider immoral.\n\r\n\"Jesus won't you fucking whistle!?\" sounds like him calling out to Jesus (either literal Jesus, or archaic morality systems), saying, \"How is this allowed to be?\" \"Something but the past and done,\" could be a rib shot at Christians, or just him saying that something needs to change in general.\n\r\nThe part about not wanting to be Sober is obviously a really extreme regret about what has happened, and how he would drink and sleep forever were it possible. That's why I don't think this song is about drug addiction. I know exactly what he's saying and i'm \"sober\" most the time. I had a friend who slept fifteen hours a day and drank when he was awake. I don't think he had a physical dependency, rather he was just running from the past. (He has since accepted it, by the way.)\n\r\nThe following self-depreciating statements are probably brought on by feelings that you've dragged somebody down. Unfortunately some of us are flawed to the point we can bring others down, and here he's complaining about other's persecution and the persecution done by himself.\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can relate to the \"trust me\" part. Many people are optimistic on a regular basis and can't see when someone is spiraling down, so every mistake you make wounds them, and you try to say, \"Just don't have faith in me.\"\n\r\nHe closes on, \"I want what I want,\" because he's human and struggling with the fact, in that time period, that he only has the strength to satisfy himself and no one else.\n\r\nThat's my interpretation.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_333": "\nI think its about belief....Jesus wont you fucken whistle....something, the something part needs to be added to the first line.

Maynard isn't  \"so deep\", \"so mysterious\" he's a puppet, a pawn for the devil!!! The only reason this band is where they are is because they sold out to the devil for talent and fame!!!

It always astounds me how 90% of the time people read these lyrics and interpret them, that people almost  always turn to God or Christ in the reference and justify it as though \"well its not really about God\"  but Maynard is just using it as a metaphor or drug addiction or insert your favorite load of garbage. The bottom line is God or Christ is blasphemed in dozens of Maynard written songs, and it's no coincidence, or happenstance but rather deliberate! Wake up! You people who channel these songs into metaphors and other arbitrary concepts are choosing to change the meaning of the songs to justify the fact that you as well as I know these songs are in fact evil wicked and wrong and you just want to justify your lifestyle because your conscience bears the true witness of the Godhead and you are simply refusing to change your life to live for God!! Quit justifying your wickedness stop serving the devil and see that these men in this band are evil and this song is no exception!!! They are puppets given fame and glory and riches by the devil for a purpose to lead fools astray! Satan is the God of this world, and whether you choose to serve God or  Satan you are serving one or the other no matter what! Start paying attention to what these people are brainwashing your minds with people!!! All rockstars promote and encourage wicked behaviour and sin! Everyone in this band is FULLY aware that they are serving Satan and that they are on their way to Hell! Maynard promotes the devil and the occult and anyone who even scratches the surface of their image and music/lyrics knows this so stop ignoring it people! Be advised! Turn to Christ and repent!

It addresses the problems with drugs \"I am just a worthless liar...I will work to elevate you just enough to bring you down\" and the fact that he can't seem to quit.  In the video you can watch the character open his \"secret box\" to get high only to come back down twice as fast as he went up.  Also in the you can watch as he moves to harder drugs.  The moral of the story, (which seems ironic) don't do drugs.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_364": "\nI strongly agree with psyberchotic, and I think that the main message in this song comes from the chorus.\r\n\"Why can we not be sober? \r\nI just want to start this over. \r\nWhy can't we drink forever. \r\nI just want to start things over.\"\r\nDrug addiction is a bad thing, obviously, and using them is self destructive.\n\r\nI also agree with psyberchotic on the verse:\r\n\"I am just a worthless liar. \r\nI am just an imbecile. \r\nI will only complicate you. \r\nTrust in me and fall as well. \r\nI will find a center in you. \r\nI will chew it up and leave, \r\nI will work to elevate you \r\njust enough to bring you down.\"\r\nThis can very well be the drugs talking.  Having used drugs in the past myself, I know that they do elevate you by making you forget your problems, only to bring you down.\n\r\nTo see that drugs are a bad thing all you have to do is look at our parents generation.  The hippies, and virtually everyone else, were heavily into all kinds of drugs and just look at how messed up this country is now!\r\n\"murder now the pattern must we,\" this is the pattern that I think Maynard is talking about.\n\r\nYes there are some good things that came from drug use, but there is no need to continue it.  Most of the ideas that came from the Hippie era are documented in movies, books, and music.  You don't need to experience them first hand, it is possible to learn from other peoples experiences.

I think the idea of being \"sober\" refers to the fact that that's when things are the worst. Sadly, alcohol can be an be an effective means of communication, but sometimes it's the ONLY means. In other words, we get along great when we drink, but it's horrible any other time. The line \"Jesus, won't you fucking whistle\" isn't calling out to the guy at all. try replace Jesus with \"for Pete's sake\" or \"Goddammit\" and you'll see what I mean. He is basically talking about the akward silences that tend to happen when they are sober.\"..won't you fucking whistle\", anything to break this akward silence.The song is basically about the stage in a relationship when either side is trying to hold on to any shred they can. Constantly bringing up past mistakes, always arguing. He implies that he is the root of the problem: \"I am just a worthless liar, I am just an imbecile, I will only complicate you, trust in me and fall as well\"\r\nHe implies that he uses her as a crutch, and will only drag her down. \r\n\"why can't we drink forever\" and forget about all of the past mistakes, and \"making every promise empty\" and \"pointing every finger at me\".\r\nWhy is it that things are only perfect when we're drunk? Can't we start this over?\r\nThat's what I get from this song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_373": "\nOk seriously, I am all about deep thought, but when a f*cking band member states what the song is about; and the video coincides... Stop implying it is about things more complex. Ever heard the song \"trapped under ice\" by metallica? It isn't about being trapped under the expectations of some overbearing institution bent on breaking your individuality... The fucking song is straight up about being trapped under a sheet of ice and dieing.\n\r\nThe guys say their friend is an artist who does his most creative work while ^'ed on narcotics (heroine). The video goes along with this theme completely, adding more reinforcement to the BANDMEMBERS claim. The track arm shaking wildly, the little figure living in a den, the muckyness off the view leading to his opening of a box (if any of you have ever known someone that uses, you know cigar boxes, shoe boxes, etc. are the prefered storage medium for their \"tools\"). The opening of the box is what starts the trip, his seeing these horrific and creative images, hallucinations, etc. \n\r\nThe manner of the unfolding events would lead one to (easily) surmise that the \"man\" is somehow innervated by the contents of the box. When the video ends the box is empty, ever seen a junky stare at his pipe while it's empty?\n\r\nJust accept that you are imposing your own thoughts onto a song, which is good, it is supposed to be done; you find your own meaning in the content. But don't get on and argue with each other about what the song is about if the answer is glaring right at you.

The first verse implies his addiction causes him to do bad stuff. The Jesus and Mary references are his cries for help from the church who responds with verses of scripture and Biblical fables that are not very useful, as opposed to divine influence to help him. The third verse, \"I am a worthless liar... I am... I will\", are the drugs talking to him.  \"Why can't we not be sober, Just wanna start this over\" implies that he lacks the willpower to quit but if he could go back he would have never started.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_380": "\nMy interpretation is that this song is a message from Satan.  \n\r\n-There's a shadow just behind me,\r\nshrouding every step I take,-\n\r\nLucifer (the state of the fallen Satan) was prideful, wanted to be just like God, but he was cast out and basically lives in God's shadow.  He thought that what it means to be God, is to be exalted above all others, however as seen by Jesus' example, it really means to serve. \n\r\n-making every promise empty,\r\npointing every finger at me.-\n\r\nAlmost all evil and sin is attributed to Satan.  He is the father of lies; all of his promises are empty and people point the finger at him.\n\r\n-Waiting like a stalking butler\r\nwho upon the finger rests.-\n\r\nSatan claims that God is a stalking butler.  What is a butler?  A butler is a \"senior worker\" who is the \"highest and most loyal servant of a household\".  This sounds very much like God.  Christians equate Jesus to God incarnate.  Jesus proclaimed that he would come as a servant or slave to his people instead of a king. Since Jesus is supposed to be the perfect example to man (to love and serve one another) but is also divine (he is the \"most high\") essentially a butler. He is a \"stalking\" butler, because Satan sees him as an overseer, or one who is always there, watching. Satan also says the blame rests on God, not him.\n\r\n-Murder now the path of \"must we\",\r\nJust because the son has come-\n\r\nFirstly, what is \"murder\"?  Murder is an \"unlawful killing, with malice aforethought\".  So basically God \"unlawfully\" does away with the path of \"must we\", just because the son has come (Jesus birth, sacrifice and resurrection).  The path of \"must we\" is the requirements, the laws that \"we must\" follow to ensure a path to salvation.  Jesus is now the way to heaven instead of the path of \"must we\".  So in short, Satan claims that God contradicts the Old Testament with the New Testament.  \"Just because the son has come\" is one of the key lyrics that leads me to believe this song to be a religious statement (besides the obvious Jesus and Mother Mary references).\n\r\n-Jesus, won't you fucking whistle\r\nsomething but the past and done?-\n\r\nA person asking to be saved would not use vulgarity and ultimatums when asking for Christ forgiveness. Instead this is Satan asking Jesus \"why don't you reveal yourself to your people?  Prove that you are real and are who you say you are instead of relying on what was done in the past.\"  \n\r\n-Why can't we not be sober?\r\nI just want to start things over- \n\r\nThis is a prime example of how Satan deceives.  There is a double negative, which instead means \"why can't we be drunk?\"  In this case, I think it means why can't we be ignorant and blind, just like in the beginning in the garden of Eden when Adam and Eve had yet to eat from the Tree of Knowledge.  Satan knows his impending doom and wants things to be as they were.\n\r\n-Why can't we drink forever?\r\nI just want to start things over-\n\r\nReinforces the lines above.  Satan is stating that he \"just\" wants to start things over, where there is only a small population, oblivious to the evils of the world.  However, I'm assuming it would be to start the whole chain of events over again because after all...\n\r\n-I am a worthless liar-\n\r\nSelf explanatory, but here it is Satan actually stating a truth, repenting and being honest about his nature.\n\r\n-I am an imbecile-\n\r\nPerhaps Satan conceding that he acted stupidly.  This could be just a way to saying \"I know I did wrong, I acted badly\" even though, being the liar that he is, really doesn't concede to anything.\n\r\n-I will only complicate you-\n\r\nThis is where some people point out that this is actually an \"anti-Christian\" song, and they may be right (religion complicates, so do drugs and drug users).  However I think it is Satan saying that he complicates things by trying to pull people away from God.\n\r\n-Trust me and fall as well-\n\r\nThis is the lyric that partially reinforces my interpretation.  If this was a religious person warning someone away from Christianity, how did that person fall?  It could make sense if is a junkie basically saying \"if I trick you into taking drugs, you'll get hooked as well\".  Satan-Sataniel fell from Heaven and is saying \"trust in me and you will fall as I have\".\n\r\n-I will find a center in you.\r\nI will chew it up and leave,\r\nI will work to elevate you\r\njust enough to bring you down-\n\r\nThis could be trying to talk from the \"drug's\" perspective, however if you go back to the lines above, how could the drug itself \"fall\", as in \"trust me and fall AS WELL\" or \"fall AS I HAVE\".  Instead it can be about religion finding a center in you, but again, how has Christianity or any Christian \"fell\"?  Satan finds your vices, conflicts your sense of right and wrong, promises you all your wishes and dreams, tempts you away from salvation and brings you down.\n\r\n-Mother Mary won't you whisper \r\nsomething but what's past and done.-\n\r\nOnce again, Satan is asking \"People pray for your guidance Mary, why don't you whisper back, prove that you are there.\"\n\r\n-Why can't we sleep forever?-\n\r\nInstead of going to Heaven, why can't humanity sleep forever after death?  Of course this can also be straight forward and mean, why can't we escape reality (drug use interpretation).\n\r\n-Trust me-\n\r\nThe ultimate thing that Satan wants is people to trust in him.\n\r\n-I want what I want-\n\r\nIf this was about drug using, then who knows what the drug user wants, which is the major question in that interpretation.  Its left up the air, \"I want what I want\", the addict may want to quit but the saying goes \"if person really WANTS to quit they would\".  Satan wants what he wants, not what God wants, not what people want.  \n\n\n\n", "comment_381": "\nI agree I really like this song-Tool is the best!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_382": "\nmoo.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_383": "\ni m drunk   but tool   is tha shit and every cd has its own  \"personality\" that is why tool is the shit\n\n\n"}
