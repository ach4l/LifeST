{"comment_0": "\nEven though this song annoys the hell out of me, I have to laugh every time he says \"Some Beach\" cause it sounds like a hillbilly mushing \"Son of a bitch\" together into a two-syllable word (sumbitch).  And this would fit the nature of the song, as in each verse, somebody does something to piss him off.  Nobody mentioned this, so I thought I would. :-P\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI think that's what he was trying to accomplish by saying \"some beach\". It's not just a coincidence\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nJust what no one 2000 said. When I heard it on the radio, I though that's actually how that verse went.\n\r\nRegardless, it's still a good song. Something near the top of my playlist when I'm not listening to grunge rock.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nOkay, so this song is very old, yes. But it was on the radio the other day and I was driving my 88 year old grandmother home and she started singing \"Some bitch, some where\" and pointed at me. I had to pull over I was laughing so hard.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI sang this song for karaoke once in choir class and everyone laughed thier asses off \r\nlol\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nthis song is hilarious, sometimes you just need to get away to that beach and take a break from all the assholes around you\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nthis is a great song..that we can all relate to. and its really easy to play on the guitar!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\n^ no one, I thought the same thing!
