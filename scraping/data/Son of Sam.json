This guy ran around killing women in the 70's.\n\r\n\"couple killer each and every time\"\r\n\"acting under orders from above\"\r\n\"the clouded mind\"\n\r\nall references to Berkowitz\n\r\nBerkowitz claimed demons controlled him and a talking dog told him to kill the girls. He later told the truth in prison that he really killed these women because of his shit relationships with his mom/other women and he would masturbate after killing these women. Berkowitz claims to be sorry for everything he did as of 2002, he's rotting away in jail and claims to be a Christian now.\n\r\nAs far as the reference to Shiva, she would be more..creative than destructive. I guess maybe this song is about good vs evil type of thing? The whole \"Shiva opens her arms now to make sure I don't get too far\" I guess too far out of her reach.

Correct me on that if I'm wrong. Also, Son of Sam WAS a \"couple killer.\" He shot at couples making out in alleys or cars with .44 caliber. Usually the men were just badly wounded and one man DID die. So he didn't just kill women, theough his anger was probably more fixed towanrds them. Elliott might be saying that his failed relationships make him a couple killer and that he didn't feel particularly great about it. He felt guilty, and that makes him no better than Son of Sam, because he knew he harbored a messed up love and hate for those women in his love. Since his dad was a doctor whom he repsected and loved, his mom was probably the nurse. Although the images are pretty sterile, aren't they? BTW, Elliott's relationship with his mom was strained. He got along much better with his dad, probably blaming his mom for letting him be abused by his step-dad. \"You tears are cheap\" he once wrote of her.

When I sat down and though about it a little more, I wonder if he didn't write it grouping different serial killers and ideas together. With the couple killer theme it reminded me of the zodiac killer more than Berkowitz. Shiva's inclusion would lend to the thought of a creative destruction element. The lyric about \"opens her arms to make sure I don't get too far\" would lead to the controlled destruction thought. Destroy a little to accomplish the bigger goal. It also brings to mind the idea that after you take a little too much you break. It brings to my mind the Michael Douglas film Falling Down. The line at the end about \"I'm a little like you, more like Son of Sam\" might be there to serve as a sort of warning that he is closer to being a serial killer than a \"normal\" individual. \n\r\nMy personal take on the Doctor/nurse bit is kind of like Lovers Need Lawyers. Doctors are usually cold. They don't show much emotion, and are more concerned with a person's medical state than the warm fuzzy feeling that isn't there. Most Nurses I have encountered have been nearly the same way. The nurses might be slightly more interested in the emotional side of things, but neither are much for emotion. I believe there was a study done on what no \"love\" factor did to infants and children. They ended up being sickly and unpleasant.

He actually said that, and that he was not thinking about Son of Sam at all.\n\r\nAccording to elliott the song is about destruction of relationships. Which, if you look at the rest of figure 8, makes a lot of sense. His albums werent concept albums, but they tended to have very similar themes. Self Titled-lots of drugs. XO-lots of references to interventions. \n\r\nJust guys. please more interviews, you can learn a lot from him. Sorry if i came off as a jerk, but, I spent 2 years researching all these songs.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_55": "\nYes, he was probably using son of sam as a metaphor. but its not about son of sam. can't just read it line for line. Poetry is for the pretentious. you gotta think like a pretentious person might.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_56": "\nI was at work and a song came on the store's radio and the piano part sounded a LOT like this song's... it sounded older, therefore i assume maybe elliott borrowed the melody or something? if anyone can help me figure this out, please reply!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
