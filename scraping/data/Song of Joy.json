{"comment_0": "\nThe singer is the killer, thats what makes the song so scary.  He says the killer quotes John Milton on the walls, the singer claiming that the cops told him this, yet he himself quotes paradise lost: \"Farewell happy fields Where joy forever dwells \".\r\nThe last part is what freaked me out the most when I first heard it. No matter how often I've heard it since, its still good for a chill.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThe narrator was definitely the killer, and as far as I can see there's three clear indications of that provided: firstly, the echo of the early reference to his tale of murder befalling \"a man and his family\" in the question \"are you a family man?\" Secondly, there's the fact that the narrator quotes Milton, as others have pointed out, fitting the killer's MO, and finally and most eeriely there's the narrator's subtly but distinctly too-knowing description of the details of the murder (\"those lunatic eyes, the hungry kitchen-knife\").\n\r\nBrilliant song, gives you a crawling sense of terror and foreboding without ever hammering it's point home clearly.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song for me centres around the ambiguity of weather the narrator is the killer and the irony of his wife being named Joy .\n\r\ngloom, that's an interesting idea i hadn't thought of the inclusion of \"Red Right Hand\" in the song in quite those terms before...\n\r\nGirgo, I don't think that the character in Red right Hand can possibly be the same as the character in Song of Joy simply for me the character in Red Right Hand is God.  the quote from Milton itself refers to the possibility of God's vengeance on the rebels.  \n\nen.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost/\u2026\n\r\nFarewell, happy fields,\r\nWhere joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,\n\r\nDoesn't the fact that he quotes paradise lost, almost abscent-mindedly during the recounting of the tale of his children's and wife's murder clarly point to him as being the murderer?  He appears to be further implicated when he claims that the killer \"In my house he wrote \"his red right hand\" That, I'm told is from Paradise Lost\".  \n\r\nThe fact that the narrator first quotes Paradise Lost in conversation and then claims to have no knowledge of it, for me seals the case that he is the killer.  \n\r\naffe, I don't see any evidence of the killer suffering from a split personailty or of this song being a kind of retelling of Jekyl and Hyde.  \n\r\nI think this song is about a family man and doctor whose wife became depressed and he grew bored of her and in revenge (the quotation of Milton \"His Red Right Hand\" supports the theme of vengeanvce if you look at it in it's original context) he murdered them and took up the life of a vagrant to kill others.\n\r\nGravityAlwaysWins I think that it is the latter.  I think the quotation from paradise lost \n\r\nFarewell, happy fields,\r\nWhere joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,\n\r\nsummarises not only the oncoming of Joy's depression but of the narrator's desire to murder his family.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nAbsolute terror!!

Without it, it's just some guy telling the tale of his dead family to some other guy in the woods......who cares?

The narrator hints that Joy was guilty in some way when he asks if it was \"an act of contrition\" that caused her sorrow, suggesting that she deserved it (in his own mind).  Also, he makes sure to point out that the daughters were \"their mother's children,\" which could only add to his sense of loss and feelings of resentment.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nHi guys. The ultimate PROOF the narrator-traveler is the killer:\n\nHe says \"In my house he wrote \"his red right hand\" / That, I'm told is from Paradise Lost\". Okay.

This \"sick friend\" is this sick side of him that he's allowing to take over, he's visiting it in his mind. I guess the doctor part could be his actual occupation or perhaps more likely, in his mind, he is curing his wife and children of their depression by killing them--in this way he's being a \"doctor\".
