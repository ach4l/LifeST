{"comment_0": "\nTo me, this song is about not being able to make it work with the one person that you love.. 'the one that got away', even.\n\r\nIt accurately shows the entire development of the relationship, from the excitement of first meeting them (we touch i feel a rush.. etc.) - to the fear of being vulnerable with this person (i've been treated like dirt before 'ya).\n\r\nHe accurately describes how people want what they can't have during the development of a relationship (you want them when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change), but justifies this as he tries to explain that it 'must've been fate':\n\r\nIt's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate\r\nI wasn't lookin' but I stumbled onto you, must've been fate\r\nBut so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take\n\r\nthose defensive lyrics, particularly the first line, highlight his fear of this commitment and sets himself up for disappointment.\n\r\nIt starts with his partner no longer wanting him which breaks his heart and he does anything to fix it. This sudden 'roller coaster' and confusion sets him into a spiral of depression and anger which makes him angry that he can't have her so he tries to kill her in his confused and angry state. He's passionately angry over how much he let himself love her and how much she doesn't care for him. \n\r\nIn the end, the artist put so much trust and knew what was at stake before putting this trust into the relationship, that when it fucked up, the effects were amplified causing self hatred for trusting this person (before i put this gun to my temple i told you this..) as well as the girl herself. \n\r\nThis song isn't just about any relationship. It's about that one person you love the most....\n\r\nSuch strong lyrics, Eminem pwns as usual.. best song on the album IMO \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nMy interpretation for the song, taking in consideration also the video, is that everything that is said in the lyrics are just thoughts about getting in an emotional relationship. People, who believe in extreme love but were hurt badly because of this, sometimes take the decision to remain cold all their lives and not show emotions, because if feelings are involved things can get ugly and dangerous. The song is a fight between him and his subconscious for not opening up. The lyrics represent the subconscious, who is reminding him how love is evil. He meets someone new that wakes up his feelings and the subconscious wants to threaten her to stay away, his falling in love and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exactly how he thought it will be and he needs her help to end it. He tries to explain himself how much love is in him and how badly it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to end if things are moving further. \r\nThe only way he would open up for her is if she will convince him and promise him that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to hurt him, but nobody can make such commitment and he knows it.   Although he will remain cold because of love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature, he wants to be remembered by her that he exists, their love cannot be saved because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late, someone hurt him badly before and he cannot be the same. He compares himself with a racket ship which can go far into space. She is very close to him, (Earth \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Moon) and from all the stars from a clear night sky he aims at her (The Moon). Telling her somehow what sacrifice she is considering his potential, but still, he \u00e2\u0080\u009caims\u00e2\u0080\u009d at her.\n\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song is absolutely amazing.

C'mon now people think outside the the box, like EM does, his words have a deeper meaning. He did and interview on sirius radio and he said the song is about the addiction.

I really don't think a \"year and six months\" would hold too much significance to the song if the woman in reference was Kim.. seeing that they have been on agian off again so many times that keeping up with how long \"this time\" lasted would be redundant.\n\r\nC'mon guys... think outside the box and listen to the words.

In the case of this song, I think it represents a certain love for addiction.  Of course no one truly wants or desires addiction... until it happens.   But, when it actually does happen the addiction is like love. \n\r\nI have an ex boy that I dated for many years and we were crazy in love!  He later became addicted to crystal meth.  For me, his struggle with this addiction felt like he was cheating on me.  Although, he never cheated on me with another girl; metaphorically speaking, he was \u00e2\u0080\u009ccheating\u00e2\u0080\u009d because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what it felt like.

I think it is about love, addiction, and his love for addiction.  And, I think it is about both drugs and girl(s).  Love can make you shake.  Drugs can make you shake.  Love can give you a rush.  Drugs can give you a rush.  Love can be \u00e2\u0080\u009cevol\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Drugs can be evil.  Every lyric in this song can be a reflection of love and a reflection of addiction.  The last verse talks about killing (it)\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 killing the addiction or killing the girl, which is not uncommon in his music because he \u00e2\u0080\u009ckills\u00e2\u0080\u009d a lot in his lyrics.  As someone mentioned above, Shady is an effing lyrical prodigy.

It is actually about an addiction because love is an addiction. \"with you I have zero strength\" people automatically think drugs but no, if you have ever felt so deeply for someone they almost complete you and you break up you feel like you have no strength. the amazing line \"love is evil spell is backwards ill show ya\" is just about this very love. love is a paradox because it is evil, but at the same time the complete opposite. Throught the song he goes about how being in love with this unknown person makes him feel so amazing but it also talks about how it can destroy you when things don't work out (hence love is evil). This love is so strong for this person that he goes into saying how he would give up anything, even die for her. He has so much feeling that he would go from complete love and compassion to hate and anger if she leaves.  \"I would've did anything for you to show you how much I adored you, but it's over now It's too late to save our love\". It seems to me that hes saying he fucked up and he still loves her and wants her back. To summarize this it seems like this is a song about how paradoxal love is, and how strong it is. He obviously screwed up, and he thinks all hope is lost but he just wishes she still thinks about him \"Just promise you will think of me every time you look up in the sky and see a star\".\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_59": "\nYeah me and my girl dated a year and 6 months then she cheated on me with one guy and broke up with me for another\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_60": "\nI can't be 100% sure but I really think this is about addiction. Em is describing falling in love with a drug after just a taste, he describes his early fears that the drug will eventually turn on him. This is seen in the first verse. The second verse talks about it being his own fault, he also notes his lack of love for hoes. Drugs have replaced his need for a real life love. \n\r\n \"I gotta hole in my heart, I'm some kind of emotional roller coaster\r\nSomethin' I wont go on til you toy with my emotion so it's over\r\nIt's like an explosion every time I hold ya\r\nWasn't jokin' when I told ya\r\nYou take my breath away\r\nYou're a supernova and I'm a...\"\n\r\nHe talks about being an \"emotional roller coaster\", leaving him vulnerable to drug addiction, which he succumbs to at the end of this verse. \n\r\nThe third verse describes how he is fully addicted, if you know anything about withdrawal this line rings true.. \" I do whatever it takes\r\nWhen I'm with you I get the shakes\r\nMy body aches when I ain't\r\nWith you I have zero strength\r\nThere's no limit on how far I would go\r\nNo boundaries, no lengths\" \n\r\nThose are powerful words if you've experienced addiction. \n\r\nOk the final verse is where Eminem REALLY gets philosophical and paints a ridiculously genius analogy. As someone noted above \"\"imma show you what it's like to hurt\"?\n\r\ni didn't know that drugs, which are inanimate, can hurt\n\r\n\"i put both hands on your throat\"\n\r\nyou can't kill drugs either \"\n\r\nAt first glance/listen it would seem this kills the drug theory. But I believe, after hours of listening, that Eminem is describing the battle between the addicted Eminem and the sobering Eminem. Here's my big theory.... The song appears to be all from Eminem's point of view on someone he loves, but in reality the song is all Eminem talking about and to to sides of himself, rapping from both points of view, that of the addict(or the drug) and the regular Marshall who falls in love with his addiction in turn becoming the addict but still exists underneath the drugs. The last verse is Eminem the drug addict going back and forth with the sobering Eminem, the two are fighting for control over Eminem. Em tries to kill off his addiction/addicted alter ego, while at the same time his addicted side threatens to live on or even kill Em(overdose). In the end, and this is the most telling line in the song. Eminem realizes the only way to destroy his addict side is to kill himself, since they are one in the same. Similar to the end of Fight Club. I know this sounds like a stretch but read these last few lines of the final verse. \n\r\n\"Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house\r\nAnd let you live\r\nTears streamed down both of my cheeks\r\nThen I let you just go and just give\r\nAnd before I put that gun to my temple\r\nI told you this\"\n\r\nThis is the key! Eminem says he won't let this \"you\" live, so he lets go, puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger. If he had just concluded he shouldn't/can't let this person walk out of the house and live, why would he then NOT KILL THE PERSON and kill himself? Unless of course killing himself guarantees the end of the \"person\" in questions life, which is the case as the addict and sober Eminem share the same body. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_61": "\nwell my friend told me the song was about his first love. i think also that he found out that shed been cheating on him so he was tryin to tell her to stop cuz she was about to leave him so he got so furious the he just lost his mid and started to choke her then snapped her neck i think i just said the obvious though\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_62": "\nwell after he made his video i dont think its about drugs cause hes fell in love with a girl and then she leaves him and he shoots himself3\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_63": "\nSo, in general I feel the song is about a girl, and the drug-like reference is to give a stronger understanding of what exactly this girl meant.\r\nNow in my own interpretation. I feel the girl is someone he just met, but fireworks are going off in him. I think touch signifies more of a brush of hands, arms, etc. And clutch is more like a hug. I feel even after his heart break and closing himself up he figured this was maybe more of a lust but realizing it isn't and he opens himself up to her letting her in, he falls in love, and thought she was too but she wants to be more of a \"close friends\" situation. He doesn't get why, he found someone he fell in love with when he wasn't looking, so he keeps her around even if it's painful because he has hope but he also did let her in. Then when he finally starts losing feelings for her in that sense, she wants him causing confusion from the denial earlier and him to ask if he should cave or not, but he takes the risk and does because he honestly loves her. The \"after a year and six months\" makes me think he is talking about the whole time they had known each other not just dated. She basically breaks his heart, he goes off saying he's basically causing her pain like he had warned, but he never did cause her the pain in return and let her go. When he insinuates he kills himself is more of a metaphor to show he basically feels beyond hurt, but he feels taking his own life and his last words basically being i love you no matter will hurt her more than any physical pain he can cause. Just my opinion. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_64": "\nHi Guys,\r\nSo Eminem is back with another hit \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpace Bound\u00e2\u0080\u009d and we here at muzu.tv are loving the slow/emotional vibe to the song.

He has two characters in this part, it, maybe it is because one is playing the role and the other one should sing, but I think it shows how he is trying to cover his real self(the person in the back sit who is angry and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust the girl) and part of him( the angry f**ked up part) tries to keep his distance and not get involved.\r\n2)Relationship: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best part and each word of it is gold, he describes his deep emotions toward her, he complains about the f**ked up chase that exist in the beginning of any relationship and how we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show our love to others without fearing that it might blow the whole thing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like you have to be unreachable to be desirable and this is a messed up game that people play, this part is amazing, in the end he asks her to make a promise(obviously in his mind) however he knows she is gonna screw him, but anyway he talks himself in and trust her.  \r\n3)The end: she leaves him, after all that he has been through and finally found the strength to trust her, she Is going and after disappointing efforts for stopping her, he gives up and let her go resulting him to die inside(or killing himself which is not different from being dead inside from his point of view)\r\nand finally there is the bitter ending, the lyrics after the shooting which is his last words to the girl which describes his lost but also true love for the girl.

But this song will always remind me of that relationship, years ago.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_83": "\nThis song is incomparable owing to em's ingenious hard-hitting verses which is a perfect example of an extra-strong emotional experience. Most of my interpretation involves expanding the cues into a contextual narrative, the implied human experience and the unfavourable environment of the current day love-affairs which is frightening, in general. Extremely touching because of its relatable ideas like possessiveness, victimhood, abuse, compulsive thinking, social frustration, loss anxiety, self-limiting cycles of insecurity, passion, undisclosed longing and bewilderment. It serves to tell that one should love more honestly. Shows that people with a broken heart need a solid assurance to believe in love again. \n\r\nGist: Space Bound has a fantastical touch with a space metaphor in the hook, implying that the harsh circumstances between the could-be-lovers as a game of cosmic fate. \n\n\r\n...its torturous: He's passionate, maybe even in excess of what this situation can allow at maximum. An overwhelming deal of emotional rush that he just cannot share with her, drives him into a chain of destructive thoughts. All such confusions mentioned in the song adds to his self-pity\n\r\n....just did the impossible: He considers this woman special for an additional reason. She showed him a picture so compelling that he faces his \"desire to be loved\" like when it was his first time. A fact so wild, he becomes childish which is most likely  unwelcomed and mispercieved. That is why at one juncture in this story he tries to hide his intense need when he says;  \"I ain't on no conquest for no mate.\" Her image in his mind unearths his past supression for ideal love. He probes across the difficulties, complexities and the few outcomes of his undisciplined imagination. \n\r\nGained my trust...: He is extraordinarily aware of his lover's recklessness and her indifferent nature. He gets this hint from how she behaves with him or meddles with his emotions. She is definitely showing him a tough time. He sort of knows that she has misused her feminine charm.\n\r\nCause if I get burnt....: He posesses a violent tendency to react in situations he can't reason with. Hardly a warning, this is a threat because he has a bitter suspicion that she will resort to mistreatment and manipulation to get it her way and it should be done away with completely if she wants to feel his genuine love. Upon overthinking toxic signs he feels the need to defend himself.\n\r\nNobody knows me I'm cold: He has not recieved his fair share of love in this life. He  has passed through a phase of self judgement in which he concluded that his need for love eventually destroys his self-esteem and then his unkind reactions distances his lover only to fuel the problems more than ever. He is cold now that the totality of his efforts to experience love has led to his own psychological disintegration.\n\r\nIts the path I've chosen:  as obvious as it is, everyone has struggles above the ones they face in intimate relationships. Those other struggles require him to be the self he is. This self isn't full of traits that exactly lead to a healthy relation. Life so far has added up to the unlovable persona he has today. With this he also reveals he is very hurt by his troubles already and would like it if she deals with him keeping this unfair reality of his life in her mind. \n\r\n...hole in my heart for some kind of emotional rollercoaster: he's content with the idea of necessary sacrifices and unconditional compromise because he's learnt its value but somehow always sets himself up for chaos by giving in to the tsunami of uncontrolled sentiments. \n\r\nTwo hundred fifty thousand miles...And I'm aiming right at you: he knows the pain it would cause him do cover the harsh path before they can be together peacefully. The fact that he knows it and still takes up the challenge makes him perfect in every dimension. This is the value he brings to their relationship which needs to be acknowledged by her even if she doesn't love him back with the same intensity. \n\r\nMy body aches when I ain't: This woman, is to him, what home means to a wanderer. The wanderer never had a chance to settle down because he wanted the right place to belong to. Wandering here means carrying on with life without a lasting personal meaning. He feels they are fated to be together inspite of multitudes of differences. Her presence is a deeply moving experience for him. She is her single chance at being complete. \n\r\nWith you I have zero strength: he doesn't want to be vulnerable in front of a person who cannot be trusted for a consistent emotional exchanges. In the later stages of a relationship, often, the other misuses his emotional surrender to their interest. It's a blood boiling fact about one's self; this is the only place in the world where he feels torn to death when something goes wrong. It's tragic, he can't properly live with her but without her he doesn't feel alive. \n\r\n*Incomplete*\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_84": "\nThe song is about Kim, eminem and kim were married in June 1999 and divorced 12 months later in August 2000 making it 14 months, then they remarried for 2 months and divorced again, making it 1 year and six months in total.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
