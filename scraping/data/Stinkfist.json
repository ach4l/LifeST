{"comment_0": "\nThis song is about we as individuals & society as a whole being overstimulated with superfluous bullshit, including sexual titillation, that we have become numb to the subtle beauty of things, & must always be striving for more (over) stimulation to the point of brutal perversion, (as in fist fucking up to the shoulder which is tantamount to killing). While fist fucking in this song is metaphorical, it is also quite a literal example of our societal perversion due to our materialistic drive & loss of spiritual connection.\n\nI couldn't listen to this song initially, thinking it was simply a na\u00c3\u00afve rebellion in profanity, but in fact this is very much a rebellious song, however it is rebelling against the very quality many people consider so important today; the freedom to satisfy ones desires to the utmost, the greatest trick of our consumer driven existence. I find the juxtaposition of the song's lyrics with the brutality of the music interesting, the music portraying the quality of over stimulation with the exception of the beautifully  gentle middle break in which there is a mourning over the loss of subtlety. Very clever song. Intensely powerful in its portrayal of the resultant personal cataclysm. This is not a song about the freedom in satisfying debauched desire.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nAccording to Maynard himself.

As most of their songs it's metaphoric. We all want to know what Maynard meant when he pulled them from the depths of his mind and wrote them into song, but thats not what he intended them for. He wants us to apply them to our own life related experiences. Hince the name TOOL. Music is a tool for most of us today, to slip into memory, or some form of spiritual healing, to find a comfortable center within. I relate songs to certain happenings in my life, good and bad. With this song you could apply it to a few different things, love, drugs, sex, self affliction, or maybe looking within one's self. Who knows what he truly meant?

This song is primarily about how everybody is becoming desensitised to everything. It literally says this in its lyrics. It's not about anal sex, it's not about some sort of dysfunctional relationship, though you're all welcome to relate your own experiences to the song because it frankly doesn't bother me...but the fact is, and this is what TOOL is renowned for believing in (facts)...that this song is meant to wake us up and ask us 'what is the point?' If you've seen any or all of the Zeitgeist 'documentaries', you'll understand. \n\nAlso, if you're simply perceptive enough to notice just how malleable western society really is, how easily manipulated and conditioned we are by corporate manipulation and media influence (think the hype generated around APPLE products and their ideals of planned and intrinsic obsolescence, and the values/mores fed to us by hollywood and pop/rap/rnb/hip-hop music), then the idea that this song could possibly be about something as petty as a relationship or even about sex, is simply ludicrous. The lyrics encourage us to think outside the box, and simply put, people here are not thinking outside the box.

It is not about society or the media!  The song really does describe my struggle with borderline personality disorder perfectly! I think the video is a metaphor for being lost in life, turned cold and hardened by abuse and all the shit you have to take. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why he's turning to stone. 1:46 is about feeling fragile, broken, shattered.  People with BPD often feel empty and hollow as if there is a hole in the soul that can't be filled \"It's not enough. I need more Nothing seems to satisfy\" yes that stuff he breaths is a drug reference. People with BPD often resort to drugs to numb all the pain or just feel something.  And along the same the lines \"I don't want it! I just need it. To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.\" is about self-harm. Which is represented by 1:05 . BPD causes dissociation which leaves the person feeling numb and dead inside! Self-harm grounds them in reality and makes them feel alive.  The pealing metaphor is about striping away layers of your personality and trying to find meaning in your life. It is part of getting better but it leaves you feeling raw and exposed.  \"Finger (elbow) (shoulder) deep within the borderline\" is not about fisting though I think he was making a pun. It is about how BPD can suck you in deeper and deeper like he is being pulled in to the \"borderline\" personality disorder. All the skewed thinking, insecurities and self- destructiveness can suck you in and consume you!  BPD also sometimes makes people angry or they act out in ways that seem mean.  It all comes from the pain but others don't always see this. He might be saying \"I'm sorry I don't want to be like this but the BPD is turning me into an asshole\" or he is finally seeing that he has been a huge ass and is trying to apologizing. \n\r\nI think this is about someone with BPD being in a relationship.  A borderline often feels a need to connect with others people to stabilize themselves and define who they are. They can at first think the person is completely awesome and can do no wrong but when the reality of this person is not consistent with this false belief then the BPD is left feeling disappointed or betrayed so that can often get angry.   The feelings of him as the BPD dealing with the other person over stimulates him witch numbs him but he still loves her. He keeps asking her to prove that they belong together. A borderline often needs reassurance that they are loved because they don't feel it. They love but don't believe they can be loved back.  The scene between 2:11 and 3:14 is showing how the interaction between the two triggers his vulnerable inner child that suffered trauma and abuse. This brings up feelings that probably make him act defensive which leaves her hurting too. The drug use and phone calls throughout the video are because to the BPD the fighting / breakup is excruciating. They will try to relive this intense pain by trying desperately to talk the person but when they can't they might resort to drugs and self-harm.  Then that other person tries to help him. The other person doesn't understand what he is going through. She tries to help with the false belief that if she can love him enough he will get better.  She says \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can help you change. Tired moments into pleasure. Say the word and we'll be, well upon our way. Blend and balance Pain and comfort Deep within you Till you will not want me any other way.\" meaning if I fix you enough the relationship won't brother you and we can be happy forever. His reply is \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's not enough. I need more. Nothing seems to satisfy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As in I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still broken. It will never be enough. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wish this away.  They break up but the song does have a happy ending. He gets therapy. This is reflected in the lines.  \"This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to. Relax.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Which starts out to be about self-harm but is then about someone helping him learn to feel without getting overwhelmed or resorting to self-harm.  And also \u00e2\u0080\u009cSomething kinda sad about the way that things have come to be. Desensitized to everything. What became of subtlety? How can it mean anything to me if I really don't feel anything at all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He is talking to a therapist!  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll keep digging till I feel something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The therapeutic possess. Witch fits the pealing metaphor, stripping away your defenses and learning to be more open.   But they still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a relationship because it hurts him too much.  At 4:15 her poking his eye is showing how bad the emotion pain she causes him feels and then he is at the table with the forks showing that he self-harms to relive that emotion pain.  The larva at the end shows that after leaving her he can start to grow and change. The wounds on his back represent the trauma from his past but they are replaced with larva that represents transformation and potential.   This shows that he has hope for the future.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nWell if taken literally this song is about fisting but if you look deeper it can also be about how people quickly become bored and numb so they always must keep trying new things to remain interested\n\r\nAnother meaning is that it can be about letting someone close to you only to have them betray you (This might hurt a little but its somehting you'll get used to)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nlove song pure and simple?\r\nit could be interpreted as a love song, but there's no such thing as a tool song that is pure and simple\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nLike pretty much all Tool songs there's layers of meanings that can be draw from the lyrics and all of them are probably as valid as the next but I think one possible interpretation that fits in well with Tool's overall ethos is that of the Third Eye.

Alcohol tells me this all the time, personally. Once you're addict, you keep digging and digging to get just a little bit higher each time until you die. You become desensitized to reality, nothing feels real. There are ways to combat addiction and the biggest one I think is to keep busy. When boredom takes over and you're constantly looking for something bigger and better and you don't reach it, you turn to drugs to help you feel something; to feel emotion.

But, since Maynard is a friggin lyrical genius, I think there's more to it than that. A lot of the lyrics, to me, reference drugs:\n\r\n\"Constant over stimulation numbs me\r\nBut I would not want you any other way\"\r\nConstantly using drugs is making the person's mind and body slowly deteriorate, but because they gain a sort of pleasure from it, they're willing to overlook the damage that is being caused.\n\r\n\"It's not enough\r\nI need more\r\nNothing seems to satisfy\r\nI don't want it\r\nI just need it\r\nTo breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive\"\r\nMaybe the person doesn't really depend on that fix at all - maybe they've just become so accustomed to the feeling of pleasure that they've grown to acquire a taste for it, for lack of better words. They might not even be getting some pleasure from it, they just know that they've convinced themselves they need to have it, whether they want it or not, otherwise they don't know how to function correctly.\n\r\n\"Finger deep within the borderline\r\nShow me that you love me and that we belong together\r\nRelax, turn around and take my hand\"\r\nTo me, this is referencing the beginning of the addiction - not so far in, maybe just experimenting (finger deep within the borderline). This is when you begin to test the waters, or your boundaries. Maybe this person is giving the drugs a try to see if it really will work to take away any pain or unhappiness that they feel (show me that you love me and that we belong together). The last line, it seems, is a personification of the drug itself, trying to convince the person using them to stop worrying and let its effects take over. The next couple of lines seems like personification too.\n\r\n\"I can help you change\r\nTired moments into pleasure\r\nSay the word and we'll be\r\nWell upon our way\"\r\nAgain, the drugs are trying to coax the person into using them by promising to take away any pain or negative feeling they might be experiencing.\n\r\n\"Blend and balance\r\nPain and comfort\r\nDeep within you\r\n'til you will not want me any other way\"\r\nThe side effects of the drug will clash and screw with the person, but in the end they WILL get hooked, no matter what they felt initially or how they feel about it then.\n\r\n\"Knuckle deep inside the borderline\r\nThis may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to\r\nRelax, slip away\"\r\nNow the person is knuckle deep, meaning that they're going further into the addiction. This is the part where it slowly builds until leading up to the inevitable crash. The second line could mean a number of things (this may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to) - 1) the person is still testing their boundaries, so they're unprepared for any negative effects the drugs have on them. If they face them enough, though, eventually the pain will go away and they won't feel it. 2) it could also mean the literal pain one might feel if they're using heroin (the prick of the needle). \n\r\n\"Something kinda sad about\r\nthe way that things have come to be\r\nDesensitized to everything\r\nWhat became of subtlety?\"\r\nNow the person is so far into the drugs that they don't feel anything. They might realize what the drugs have done to them, but since the addiction has basically drained them, they don't really seem to care much more than an, \"Oh well.\" The last line (what became of subtlety?) is the abuser asking how a little fun could turn into something so serious.\n\r\n\"How can it mean anything to me\r\nIf I really don't feel anything at all?\"\r\nFollows the same as the above lines. How can they sympathize with anyone else if they don't even know what they're feeling themselves?\n\r\n\"I'll keep digging 'til\r\nI feel something\"\r\nBy now they've realized their lack of feeling - of anything - and decide to make themselves feel something again. So they're going to keep using the drugs over and over in hopes that doing so will make them feel something again, even though it's just making everything worse.\n\r\n\"Elbow deep inside the borderline\r\nShow me that you love me and that we belong together\r\nShoulder deep within the borderline\r\nRelax, turn around and take my hand\"\r\nThroughout the song, the depth has gotten progressively deeper (first finger deep, then knuckle deep, then elbow, and finally shoulder). This symbolizes the person falling further into the addiction until they are finally being swallowed by it. By now, there is no saving the person from the drugs, and it seems they've given up too. \n\n\r\nSo, that's just my thoughts.

Since people were dumb enough to take it literally, they must have named this song stinkfist (anal fisting) as another joke because this song is about the same thing as 4 degrees.

Fifty years ago you couldn't say the word 'pregnant' on television but now you can say nearly anything on any television show you like.  People have been shocked at this, but shock gives people a kind of entertainment.  If they like it, they like it, if they don't, they're going to tend to do something about it, which is only further publicizing the television show or band's lyrics by picketing against them.\n\r\nBy now the average person has seen enough shooting in video games, the news, etc. that the true thing wouldn't really shock us all that much.  By now, what person who turns on their television and reads about a grizzly murder breaks down crying?  Nearly no one.  Why?  Because they don't feel empathetic, or even sympathetic, any longer.  They've heard it all before and it's too late for them to feel anything but numbness about the situation.\n\r\nThe metaphor of fisting exists to show how someone gradually builds tolerance to something and needs more of that something to feel effect or shock.

He hid 15 different meanings into one song.  Sure if you read the lyrics drug adiction and fisting both fit, but this song isnt just about that.  You cant look at Tools songs individualy.  You have to look at every song they have ever done.  In my experience most of their work has been about pushing the boundaries of what society sees as \"right\".  This song seems to acknowledge the downside to this; becoming desensitized and numb.  But I would not want you any other way\n\r\nby n8 on 07-03-2002 @ 12:48\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_98": "\nI believe this song on the most shallow level can and was made to be interpreted as the fisting of a lover... and I thoroughly believe Maynard did this on purpose.  The context of the lyrics, while seemingly out of place, do excactly what they are meant to do--pull you in by their seemingly offensive diction.  The context and conotation of the words (once you study them) illustrate Maynard's original point.  Like Maynard said in his interview (and might I add quite vaguely like he always does), this song is dedicated to a friend of Danny's nicknamed Stinkfist.  Nothing is ever enough for this Stinkfist.  Stinkfist is addicted to instantly gratifying himself...whether it be drugs, sex, or in his case work, or striving for material success (or as Maynard would say material excess).  The easiest and most vivid way to poetically paint a portrait of this image is through the vulgar description of this type of sex.  As many guys know, and almost all women know...its harder and harder for a woman to reach orgasm  when the object placed inside her consistently becomes larger...mainly because she gets looser and looser.  As many drug addicts know, you have to pop more pills, smoke more, inject more, etc. to reach the same high the next time.  For Stinkfist to get the same high off success he had to gain more and more material wealth.  This is all because the body and mind both build a tolerance to certain types of stimulation.  If the stimulation becomes excessive (\"overstimulation numbs me\"), the individual will never reach the \"instant gratification\" they need to cope with a life that just isn't satisfactory.  You know Stinkfist's life isn't satisfactory or happy because he is bored and numb, not feeling alive...as Maynard says, \"Boredom's not a burden Anyone should bear \" and \"It's not enough I need more Nothing seems to satisfy I don't want it I just need it To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive\". \r\nThe three stanzas clarify the entire message the song is trying to portray.

I think it portrays the idea of the hedonic treadmill.  (Hedonist meaning pleasure seeker)  The more stimuli one receives, we need more next time to keep the buzz.  Take anything that offers up an amount of pleasure or reward for example: drugs, sex, video games, thinking of heaven, money, and exedra.  The more pleasure of one thing we get, the more is needed next time to seek that same level of pleasure.  Many of you probably can relate with it with drugs, but money can be an obvious one.  The more money we make we feel gratified.  Yet after a while we take it for granted and consider it to be the given that we may make a lot of money.  So you keep striving to make more money and more!  You never really are satisfied because there is no one amount that gives you contentment with this mind set.  \n\n\r\nOne of my favorite parts of this song is when it says:\r\nI just need it \r\nTo breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive \n\r\nAND\r\nHow can it mean anything to me \r\nIf I really don't feel anything at all?  \n\r\nSystematic desensitization has made this person feel almost nothing again.  If he feels nothing than is he really alive?  Is he dead inside?  Which leads to more interpretation with emotional theories (james-lang theory. cannon-bard theory. schachter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\r\nTwo factor theory) Basically it asks the old question when a tree falls in the forest and no one is there does it make a sound?  OR If we feel nothing did we really experience anything at all?     And do I need this pleasure to know I am a being on this earth?\n\r\nP.S.  The only way the old question,  \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen a tree falls in the forest and no one is there does it make a sound?\u00e2\u0080\u009d is applicable if we actually have the emotion of pleasure in our head but we fail to recognize it.  But, for example, a person with a hedonic treadmill mindset (someone addicted to drugs for example) may not have that initial emotion because more pleasure may be needed to even have that emotion even exist until that emotion will almost be extinct.  If that has happened then no tree is falling in the forest but someone was there to here nothing.  Kind of a depressing thought.  \n\r\nThis is just what I was thinking about Stinkfist, but this song has confused me for the longest time.

All too frequently it's actually much worse - a blatant lie to sway public opinion in favour of the man and his current mission du jour.  \n\r\nAnyone remember this one?:  Let's go smoke iraq in the name of national security... no wait, liberation... no wait... saddam's a jerk... no wait... anything but rapidly depleting fossil-fuels and the resulting american interests in the middle east, since noone would get behind a cause so self-serving, no matter how much they love good old GWB and his oil-barren ilk.    \n\r\nWMD's people... they're there, and that's why we've go to go a killin'... total BULL.

I for one would not call the near-simultaneous deaths of 50000 people a MEDIUM scaled disaster, and I would certainly never go so far as to label their demise a necessary pre-requisite to the US' subsequent \"improvements\" in national security.  \n\r\nListen to the song again, my friend.

The artist also feels that not one person deserves to be alone as indicated by the second half of this phrase.\n\r\nConstant over stimulation numbs me\r\nBut I would not want you any other way\n\r\n-I belive this phrase is a lead in to the following after it. It says that the artist's current habbits in searching for love still leans towards phyisical attraction and less of mental.\n\r\nIt's not enough\r\nI need more\r\nNothing seems to satisfy\r\nI don't want it\r\nI just need it\r\nTo breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.\n\r\n-This just complements the previous phrase by saying that the artist needs more than physical attraction, it's not enough. He needs to know what true love is to feel alive.\n\r\nFinger deep within the borderline\r\nShow me that you love me and that we belong together\r\nRelax, turn around and take my hand\n\r\n-This, and the phrases that repeat this, all mean one thing really, the blind jump a person needs to take to express their true feelings for another person, the following phrases just means that the artist is sharing deeper and deeper feelings towards another person, hoping that they will trust and respect the artist's feelings.\n\r\nI can help you change\r\nTired moments into pleasure\r\nSay the word and we'll be\r\nWell upon our way\n\r\n-This clearly is a lead in from the previous phrase, saying that the artist wants to express his love deeper than just dry humping. The artist wants to be stimulated even further, even offering the world to the person the artist loves.\n\r\nBlend and balance\r\nPain and comfort\r\nDeep within you\r\n'til you will not want me any other way\n\r\n-This resembles the constant struggle and complexity of each human being. To express your true feelings to another person is a great leap that might blossom into something that cannot be worded other than love.\n\r\nSomething kinda sad about\r\nthe way that things have come to be\r\nDesensitized to everything\r\nWhat became of subtlety?\n\r\n-This phrase is much like the epifoney/climax (Probably spelled incorrectly) of the song. The artist now realises what society has deemed true love to be just a hoax, the fact that society is now desensitized to anything but phyical attraction to another human being. People are such in a rush to flirt that they don't take time and do not use subtlety to listen and learn from the other person.\n\r\nHow can it mean anything to me\r\nIf I really don't feel anything at all?\n\r\n-This phrase is a follow up to the previous. If a person rushes to flirt/one night stand, how can you self-determine what true love is? How can love mean anything to a person who just looks for tits and ass?\n\r\nI'll keep digging 'til\r\nI feel something\n\r\n-He will not give up, he will not succum to society's standards of true love, he want's something more.\n\r\nThis song clearly fortifies the the true thoughts of a young adult morphing into a mature adult.

I think that this is poking at capitalism as a whole. Our consumation/indulgence in everything will leave you feeling really numb and disconnected with other people/yourself/nature/emotions. He uses the metaphor of fisting as a parallel to the extreme lack of moderation. Instead of readin the lyrics with sexual actions in mind, one could easily substitute the feeling of emptiness and (SADLY) accepting a consumer numbness.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_195": "\nEvery good poem or song by any decent artist has at least two different levels: the surface level (literal meaning) and the universal level (what it is saying about humanity, the world, etc.). Judging from the debate going every which way about the meaning of this song, it's obviously qualified to be one of those greats.\n\r\nI don't think there's much doubt that it's about (in one form or another) desensitizing and/or addiction. As to whether it's about drugs, one-night stands or fisting, I think Maynard left it deliberately ambiguous. The title Stinkfist could lead it in the direction of fisting, but also metaphorically toward \"getting your hands dirty,\" which as Faith points out is the POV of the giver.\n\r\nTo tie most of what people are saying together, it's important to look at the fact that Maynard references \"comfort\" \"pleasure,\" etc. --not just tired moments and pain. The common theme is not just addiction or desensitivity alone: it's both.\n\r\nTaken from the angle of fisting, this song portrays one person who \"needs more\"  and is constantly being desensitized by what gives her (or him, if you're into anal) pleasure. Again, \"Stinkfist\" is talking about the giver getting their hands dirty dirty--in two ways. First in the literal sense, but also in the sense of becoming guilty in the process of desensitizing their partner.\n\r\nFrom the drug angle, the themes are the same--the only difference is that giver and receiver become the same person. That's an important element because it makes the song ambivalent as to whether the themes address self-inflicted harm, per se, or those inflicted on someone else.\n\r\nFinally we come to the universal level where I think the song is is talking about how people take comfort in [addicting] momentary pleasures which really only serve to desensitize them even more. It also explores the guilt factor of those providing the pleasure, whether that person be oneself or, as the title implies, someone else.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_196": "\nOnce upon a time, it did not take much to shock people (for example, saying the word \"sex\" on television was scandal-worthy material).  But due to constant overstimulation, we need much more in order to be shocked.  For example, we might have to see sex.  And sex itself isn't even that shocking now; so in order to be shocked, we need something terrible like a vivid rape scene or a graphic torture scene; this repersents the whole arm.\n\r\nThe anal fisting is a metaphor for the media's constantly loosening boundaries (the boundaries that encompass only what is acceptable), and the song asks the question, \"when will it take the whole arm?\" \n\r\nFinger = the word sex.  Shoulder = child torture/rape scene with bears devouring (and perhaps raping) babies in the background.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_197": "\nDrugs I believe, BUT TOOL KICKS ASS ANYWAY!!!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_198": "\nI think that this song is about a dying relationship...and trying to find something more to keep it alive.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_199": "\nThis is my favorite Tool song (but I don't recommend eating while listening to it - the mental image makes me a little naseous around food).

It's not even something integral to life, it's all materialistic.  It forces people to yearn for the next level, wearing out the feeling each time.  It's a loss of appreciation for the original pleasure.  \n\r\nWhen I heard Hypnotize by SOAD, it made me think of this song.

I cannot see the sex/fisting idea for a second!\n\r\nBorderline is used to mean the end of control, humanity, the point of choas.  Think of 'the borderline' as the surface of water.  It is at your fingertips, at your knuckles, at your elbows, at your shoulders.\n\r\nThe song can either be interpreted as having two Identities(or entities) or three: User and Drug, or User, User, and Drug.\n\r\nThe first verse talks about being used to overstimulation and not being able to bear down time.  The dilemma of high stimulation and excitement and the fact that it cannot last forever and how it tolls on the rest of life.\n\r\nThe Chorus is simply saying how a user always tries to get that perfect high.  As the body adapts to the drug it is harder and harder to get a high and it becomes dependant on the substance.\n\r\n\"Finger deep...\" The water is rising.  \r\n\"Show me that you love me...\" This is either personafying the User's relation with the drug or is explaining the relationship of the User with another user.\n\r\nThe verse is the same; Either User & Drug or User, User, & Drug.  I am more partial to the former so I'll go from there.  The verse personafies the drug.  The drug will change your boredom into pleasure mixing pain and comfort, change and balance till you become hooked.\n\r\nThe water has risen to the knuckles.\r\n\"This may hurt a little...\" I believe this to be a reference to shooting up (crack, heroin).\n\r\nAt this point the User is lamenting that he can no longer find pleasure in life and that he cannot attain a sastifying high.  Still he keeps diving deeper and harder into the Drug attemping to gain satisfaction and contentedness.\n\r\nThe water is at the elbows and the User is trying to find comfort in companionship to ease the feeling of lack of control.  The water is at the shoulders (and soon to be overhead) the User is comforted by either a companion or the familiarity of the substance and continues use.\n\r\nThat is my opinion of the song.

Actually, the addiction could be to anything destructive, e.g. gambling.  At the beginning of the video the guy takes a hit from a massive bong-like contraption and then coughs up a big plume of smoke.  No mysteries there.  Then when the lyrics \"I can change tired moments into pleasure\" kick in you see a woman.  She represents the drug.  Notice that her arm falls off.  She's the one who is doing the fisting (blend and balance pain and comfort deep within you til you will not want me any other way).  \r\nThen you see the woman playing with an electrical plug in a socket.  On the other side of the wall there is a kid with no legs, and there is a wire coming out of him.  Perhaps the kid represents a person who's physical and psychological growth has been stunted by drugs.  Anyway, when the woman vibrates the plug, the kid starts shaking.  When she pulls the plug out he stops shaking.  Pretty clear that she is overstimulating him, then leaving him numb.  Two thirds of the way through the song, when there are no lyrics, you see the images of tormented addicts, their heads distorted by the effects of drugs.  The you see the main guy using a razor to shave the skin from his head, and the woman emerging from a cocoon.  I think this is where the guy realizes he needs to get away from his addition.  Change/evolution/growth is the theme of the whole album and the idea of shedding/molting is more directly dealt with in Forty six & 2.  When the lyrics resume both the guy and the woman have color patters on them, representing some sort of change.  And the lyrics go \"there's something kinda sad about the way that things have come to be.  Desensitied to everything, what became of subtlety.\"  Confirm that the guy is having second thoughts about the drug.  But the woman still wants to be in him - she is behind him caressing his face, but then the guy puts up his hands in a way that says \"get offa me, beotch!!\"  At the very end the guy has a larvae like worm growing out of his shoulder.  I think this is just to represent the change he has made in his life - his abandonment of the drug.  He has evolved to a better, stronger person who can resist the drug, who continues to beckon to him in the last line of the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_207": "\nI just want to say...if you think Maynard wrote this about fisting and wants you to think that...you are stupid.

There are always higher goals, always a next step, always the choice of getting better kicks from different things. But here's the catch: with dissatisfaction, there exists exaggeration. And this is all that the song is trying to tell. Fisting is a great exemple for this, it might be ok to finger a girl, but it's absolutely not ok to put your arm through her vagina.

An Anima is your soul (see Carl Jung teachings). An Enema is anal abortion, cleaning all the shit from your ass. When these words are mixed they make Aenima, which is soul cleansing. \n\r\nStinfist is the action of doing so, clearing out your soul, digging into yourself (I'll keep digging till I feel something\"), and cleaning out all the shit. Hence the name, Stinkfist. \n\r\nThe begining talks about someone wanting to change, wanting to come clean. \"Something has to change, undenyable dilemma, boredom's not a burden anyone should bare\"\n\r\nSo that person starts digging into themself, \"finger deep within the border line\" But thats not enough to clean it entirely, its \"not enough I need more, nothing seems to satisfy..\" so as the song goes on, the person digs deeper, \"knuckle deep...\", elbow deep...\", ect. \n\r\nAfter this comes the person questioning why its so hard to come clean & why they would even want to, because it doesnt seem to be working.\n\r\n\"Something kinda sad about\r\nthe way that things have come to be\r\nDesensitized to everything\r\nWhat became of subtlety?\"\n\r\nAfter that, the decision comes to keep digging until its all gone, until the person can feel their true self again.\n\r\nNote that after that part of the song, the \"Not enough I need more\" part is skipped twice, and replaced with more \"digging\" until the song ends with \"Relax, turn around and take my hand\" The song is over, the person is reunited with themself.\n\r\nHaving said all that you can guess what the other lines mean, im not typing it all down.\n\r\nTwo more things:\n\r\n1. The \"coming clean\" could be literally coming clean off drugs, or could be a metaphor for finding inner peace...\n\r\n2. judging by the perspective, it could be someone else cleaning this persons soul. \"Show me that you love me and that we belong together..\"\n\r\nI'm just going to leave it at that.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_241": "\nyou \"tools\" are thinking into it way too much. i say it's about fisting... the title is STINKFIST.

Anyways, the song is about a powerful love and hate relationship between two people (like the intensity of a relationship between an addict and their substance).  How does that in any way represent the effortless, thoughtless and numbing relationship a person has with their media or entertainment venue.  I feel that though the media interpretation is possible, it is way more \"far fetched\" than the addiction interpretation.  Oh yea by the way have you ever seen the music video?

The song is about the progression of taking things farther to alleviate boredom. The same old thrills just don't cut it anymore. It can be drugs. But it can also be any obsession. Video games, music, fishing, cars, sex, money. For example I used to like nintendo growing up. But then nintendo doesnt do \"it\" for me any more, so I go farther across the borderline with super nintendo, then n64, then ps, ps2, ps3, im shoulder deep here. \n\r\nAs far as the desensitized part goes, its just that like, with things that are more limited you will find that more subtle differences make a huge impact on the amount of satisfaction one gets from it. Like vanilla ice cream. Theres not much you can do to improve on vanilla ice cream. Its the little subtle differences that make all the differences. But in our society of technology (and media) constantly pushing limits theres no need to worry about subtle differences with many things. For example audio speakers. It used to be that subtle differences made a good speaker. Better sound quality was something people went for. But now speakers and amps can just get so much louder for so much less money.

I first became aware of music outside of church hymns through a tiny little radio tape deck I had. I used to record the radio and make mix tapes of my favorite songs and listen to them in my bed late at night. When I first heard Stinkfist, It hurt me to listen to the lyrics. I was young and wasn't capable to comprehend metaphores in music yet and took it for the literal meaning only. Yet the passion in the voice and the visual sounds of tool drew me in. This was the first step in my breaking free and becoming who I am today. I didn't want it, yet I needed it, to know I'm alive. Now reading the lyrics, I interpret it as a love song, a bitter reality of love. I have felt both sides of the duality presented in this song. Love is not easy because it's easier to ignore the subtleties and turn to other means of satisfaction. Sex can be subtle but it can also be primal and physical. In this case The fist entering deeper and deeper is satisfying a \"fix\" but in doing so makes it harder and harder to get back to what started it all. \"And love is not a victory march, it's a cold and broken Hallelujah\" -The late Jeff Buckley. I see a lot of different interpretations posted here and I believe if Tool were reading them they would be proud. Tool's lyrics are intended to mean something different to everyone. If I was battling drug addiction, I could easily apply this song to my condition and that is beautiful.

In both cases one seeks to either enter a deeper level with his \"love\" of whatever nature it may be or enhance the emotional expirience itself. Concider the borderline syndrom, too: Borderliners are people who generally are very anxious and unhappy with themselves who seek comfort from somebody who won't be able to meet their demands for emotional intimacy or will fail to project the role of the protector onto the borderliner. Thus he turns more depressed about his true emotional distance to others. Because of that sense of distance and the need for intensive attention by others, borderliners also are said to cut themselves. I've cut myself too in the past, which had been both easening in situations of much anxiety (I'm scared of crowds) and frustrating when failing to meet the beforementioned state of relaxation.\r\n And here you go, the phrase \"finger deep inside the borderline\" may as well just refer to the disorder itself, which you may wanna read about. To reiterate, I have a friend who was massively bullied in his old school which ultimately lead to extremely catatonic states when confronted with bullies. In order to tackle his unawareness of his own body, he began to exercise massively (that's by his own words) to again \"feel [himself]\". Again, in some way, sensitivity is worn down and tried to be regained, which may result in the decision to increase the sensual input, as with drugs for example, but maybe when you look at the song it's simply about the effort to break free from it. So you have drugs, sex and love...And in all cases the *basic concept* is, that the subject has grown indifferent and desentisized and needs overstimulation to expirience the desired effects of whatever it is he wants to expirience.\n\r\nYou may now apply this concept of a subjective undercurrent of stimulation to whatever it is you think...Partnerships having developped routine, the ever increasing dosage of a drug as tolerance increases, a boredom with sex or longing for intimacy and trust by others.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_341": "\nAnyone notice how the lyrics go from finger deep, all the way up the arm, and ending at the shoulder?

And im not one to generally overthink these things as i prefer to think that the artist will make it obvious if they want us to have a certain idea of what the song is about, otherwise it can mean a multitude of things. But look a little deeper.\n\r\nTake a look at these lines...\n\r\nBoredoms not a burden anyone should bear\r\nConstant over stimulation numbs me\r\nDesensitized to everything\r\nWhat became of subtlety?\n\r\nNow a good analogy for the last two lines is family guy. Don't get me wrong, im as much a supporter of the show as the next guy, possibly more lol. But the truth is, when looking at shows like family guy or even just looking at the news (shootings, murder, rape) we have desensitized ourselves. Nothing has shock value anymore. No sense of propriety or subtlety. We (or at least some of us) have therefore become bored with everything, even life in general. Constantly searching for some sense of stimulation. I know i personally look towards massive amounts of sex, drugs, music, skating, and shocking comedy (family guy, south park, etc.)\n\r\nNow think of the things i listed... which do you think maynard looks to? ;)\r\nHere, i'll give you a hint in the lyrics... lol\n\r\nBlend and balance\r\nPain and comfort\r\nDeep within you\r\nThis may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to\n\r\nPainful sex. Sex is one of the greatest feelings a hominid can achieve. And pain is one of the few surefire ways to know you're still alive. And for those who feel like they're living a hollow existence- not sure if this can truly be considered \"living,\" or if this is merely \"existing,\"- pain can make you feel alive. I personally don't like painful sex lol, nor do i condone emo kids cutting themselves. The true way to feel pain and feel alive is to skateboard. give blood, go skateboarding.\n\r\nAnyway, in summation of much too long a rant: This is about becoming desensitized to life, constantly searching for some form of new and better stimulation, and looking for it in sex.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_342": "\nFingers, knuckles, fists, digging, elbows, shoulders, hhmmmmm.

It says it in the song itself:\n\r\n\"Something kinda sad about\r\nthe way that things have come to be\r\nDesensitized to everything\r\nWhat became of subtlety?\"\n\r\nThis song, while it may have sexual reference, is almost certainly not about sex but rather using sex as an image for an idea they are trying to portray. Tool rarely if ever put things on a surface level and reducing them to \"oh stinkfist it is about sex and being bored\" is pretty weak.\n\r\nThe song I think isn't directly about sex or drugs or a relationship or anything in particular but more about the idea of these things and how we become slaves to them. Plug in your drug, whether it be sex, or heroine, or TV or hey maybe even popular songs (wink wink). I think Maynard later follow-ed up with a more direct, easier to handle metaphor with a perfect circle when he wrote The Hollow. You get the same gist in that song, temporary satisfaction... It just doesn't stay and need to do something to bring back that feeling.\n\r\nOf course, if I were gonna plug in to something, I would say it is a direct attack on anti-intellectualism in the USA (world?). People in our time cannot STAND being \"bored\" or being in their own minds. Always got to have something to make us happy(er). Grass is greener mentality, through and through. We find something to entertain ourselves but then it stops working, so we have to find something else... All at an attempt to never have to deal with ourselves, with our own thoughts and lives.\n\r\nAnyways, long rant just to say be careful at taking a Tool song for surface value. It is more likely that this song has NOTHING to do with sex/relationships than it is that ALL IT IS ABOUT is sex/relationships. I think he is using the imagery for a metaphor for \"insert your drug here.\" -- in a sense calling us out on our inability to live in our own heads and depending on things, people or substance to make us feel alive (when we should be focused on how alive we are).\n\r\nRemember, Maynard asks us a lot to focus on our existence and importance of being alive (46+2, Third Eye, Parabol(+a), Lateralus, Disposition, Reflection, to name a few) and NOT on the superficial bullshit that people put on us (Aenima, The Hollow (APC), Stinkfist?).\n\r\nMy $0.02 cents...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_346": "\nHas anyone considered that this could be about cutting?

The speaker in the chorus section speaks that he can't tell if he is truly alive or not. What defines life from nothingness?What makes a man truly alive, so he turns to his addiction, be it sex, drugs, or murder, whatever. However this seems to only stave off his need to feel alive and not satisfy it. Thus the line about keeping digging until he feels something. The lines spoken in the softer tone are his subconcious decieiving and in some cases trying to help him. At the end of the first chorus, the line \"take my hand\" is cut off just at \"hand\" by the guitar rhythm. This could represent him just barely missing the true answer to his satisfaction. At the end of the song, we hear the line completed and this could represent that ultimate finding of this, and judging by the connotation of \"take my hand\" is possibly love. \n\r\nAll in all I believe the song to be about failed attempts at happiness and the destruction one can do on the themselves to \"to breathe, to feel, to know they are alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_354": "\nThis song is using fisting as a metaphor for tolerance.

On the surface it seems to be using fist-fucking as a metaphor for trying to connect in this modern life where we are so alienated that we are nearly numb. We've reached a critical point in our evolution. (\"Something has to change, undeniable dilemma\") We need to feel something to even know we're alive anymore. I like the way one of the verses goes from finger deep to knuckle deep to elbow deep and ends with shoulder deep. It's visual and disturbing.

We see him reference the \"shadow\" archetype of Carl Jung's psychoanalytic theory. The connection this has to Stinkfist is his use of the \"borderline.\" A borderline personality has continuous shifts in relationships between idealization and devaluation. These shifts occur when the borderline experiences real or imagined threats of abandonment. Another characteristic of this personality disorder is that these individuals tend to lack executive abstract thinking-so they are likely to seek out highly sexualized relationships or drug use or shopping-impulsive endeavors. Seemingly Maynard is reflecting on a relationship where he tried to retain a relationship with an individual with this condition. Further, Tool is a social commentary band-they make efforts to delineate the human condition in terms of how we live together. The discussion of this experience relates to how this borderline is a growing presence. The fisting reference is a metaphor for the ongoing need for more stimulation-thus is the way to entertain a relationship with this woman. Deeper and deeper into the borderline he becomes the more she must be stimulated to stay with him. Maynard is not a drinker, nor does he use drugs, therefore his descriptions of drug abuse are always coming from an outsiders perspective.\r\nThis is what I have put together based on knowledge and friendships.\n\n\n", "comment_364": "\nthis song is probably about sex. i dont know how everyone sees bordom of as the topic\n\n\n", "comment_365": "\nnevermind i didnt watch the vid, but yea you guys are right my bad\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_366": "\n These lyrics have both literal and metaphorical meaning.

Also, two other critical symptoms of borderline are the \"dilemma\" of not knowing if you're straight, gay or bissexual, and the cronic feelings of emptiness.\r\n And what's peculiar about this disease is that people, as far as i know, will explore homossexuality in the \"anal\" way, without feeling that is completely a good thing or a cool thing.

It's really about the media and society shoving all of this corrupted and sick bullsh*t up our asses. It's a metaphor that uses fisting (sticking your finger, fist, knuckles, etc. further up someone's ass) which is gross and disgusting, to say that the media is telling us to do all of these wrong acts to feel \"alive\" and be \"cool\" and try new things and \"live a little.\" It shoves it further and further up our asses until we can no longer ignore it.

But two particular verses in this song cause me to believe that this song is about the internal NEED to get the most out of life and embracing every aspect of life and never letting moments go to waste. These two verses are the ones I relate most to, and are also what inspires my interpretations: \"Something has to change undeniable dilemma boredom's not a burden anyone should bear\" \"It's not enough I need more nothing seems to satisfy I don't want it I just need it to breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive\" Regardless of the meaning, this song is one that will continue to inspire and move me. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_378": "\nNot to be rude here, but it is bothering me that some people fail to see the obvious lyrics. This song is not a love song, and sadly it isn't even that \"deep\" of a song. For those of you that have trouble with listening to things and picking up there meanings, you could try searching for there video, its is especially good.\n\r\nNow, the song is about stimulation, but not drug stimulation. It is about every one of us. We in this age are on our computers excessivly, we watch tv all the time, and when we have none of that, we have our iPod's and our Phones. So, you see he is not talking about a drug of any kind. He is talking about our addiction to stimulation, we have to know what is going on in everyone's life, in every corner of the world at all times. \"Something has to change - Undeniable dilemma - Boredom's not a burden - Anyone should bear ---- Constant over stimulation numbs me --- But I would not want you any other way.\" \r\nIn those 2 stansa's he is stating that we are wasting away our life by over crowding it with stimulation, we all know that we are, but we will not change, because we are so used to being numb.\r\n--\"Something kinda sad about - the way that things have come to be - Desensitized to everything \r\nWhat became of subtlety?\". In this line once again, he is stating now that he has seen so many horrors, that one would have been tramatized by before, that he no longer feels anything for them. For example we watch tragedies on the news, and on the internet everyday, we watch movies with terrible things happening to people, this stimulates our brains, but the sad thing is, is that eventually when a death in your community happens you may slow find the effects and emotions that would have once crushed you will no longer effect you at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_379": "\nLet's not forget that this album was dedicated to Bill Hickse's death.

I can't speak for the song, or the fact that like most tool songs, it has many layers of meanings. But it's pretty obvious to me from the video that it's talking about how we repress certain aspects of ourselves that we don't appreciate, then they push their way up to the surface. and the more you deny it the more it shows itself, in yourself and others. kinda the mirror thing ya know? it's Jungian philosophy about the Shadow Aspect. all the repressed aspects and emotions and parts of your self.... keyword PART of yourself. You'll notice in the first part of the video the guy grows a lump on his back and takes it off and seals it away in a jar. That's a metaphor for repressing parts of yourself. you lock it away in a dark corner to collect dust, just to find out that it will always push its way back to the surface, cause you can run but you cant hide from yourself. The female character in the video, who seems really hurt and mistreated/repressed is the Anima (more Jungian philosophy). You also will notice all the other characters who seem deformed and disfigured, they are other parts of himself that the Shadow is revealing to him. Later in the video they both shed their sandy artificial skins, and you see them in their true form, their flesh... and you'll notice the big scar on the guy's back where he cut away his shadow/part of himself. At the very end you see a squirming lump of flesh on the ground, then you see that it's become a big mutated growth on his back that whispers to him. This is the reintegration of the Shadow and the Anima with the Self. Metaphorically, he's done his best to reconnect with this part of himself that he cut off, and become whole again, though altered. It's all one big metaphor though, you can't take anything about Tool songs literally, they are deeply metaphorical. Especially the videos.\n\r\nI hope this has helped some of you to understand the deeper meaning in this song... \n\r\nThis isn't really a personal interpretation of mine, i have several others that can apply more to me personally, but this is a broad interpretation that i think the band was trying to convey. Another way to view it is the relation between male and female partners. you see how she tries to reach out to him and caress him and she sticks her thumb in his eyelid, then they both seem to be too distant to communicate (like in Schism) while the male holds his hands out and the female shakes her head in frustration. Another metaphor, like i said, multiple layers of meaning.\n\r\nBe open minded at all times. Peace!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_384": "\nWell, this is typical.. I know.

When I depict him saying \"show me you love me\" and \"we belong together\" makes me think that hes trying to convince someone he thinks he loves to be with her because he wants to fit into society. Most parts of society make us believe we can find true happiness and bliss from love. Maynard's characters boredom has caused him to try to grasp at any signs of happiness or fitting in when really its not there.To me the borderline represents one side being outsiders and people with depression and the otherside is popular society and people that all seem happy.
