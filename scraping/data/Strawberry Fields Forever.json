{"comment_0": "\nIt seems to me that John wrote this song as a representation of a place that he goes in his head to escape his troubles.  When he was younger, he often took refuge in Strawberry Field.  This song is using Strawberry Field as a metaphor for a place he mentally wanders to forget his stress.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThe song opens with the chorus, \"Let me take you down cos I'm going to, Strawberry Fields, nothing is real, and nothing to get hung-about. Strawberry Fields forever.\" \n\r\nIt was written during the time of the Beatles, and has both figurative and metaphorical representations. One, it is an actual place John went to visit often - Strawberry Fields being an orphanage near John's home in Liverpool where he went as a young boy to escape his troubles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 And two, this song is also using Strawberry Fields symbolically - a place he mentally wanders to forget his stress - yearning for simpler times. He also is frustrated and disillusioned with those who go through life blind to things going on around them, and too there are indications of Lennon's own insecurities about his genius. John invites us to come on \"down\" and join him into a world where there is no fussing, fighting, or killing.\n\r\n\"Living is easy with eyes closed. Misunderstanding all you see.\n\r\nThis is so true when you deliberate about how easy life is when you accept things superficially and don't utilize research. However, John knew that living life shallowly is not really living at all.\n\r\n\"It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out.\"\n\r\nJohn finds seeing things as they really are is no easy task, but he trust that in the end it will all work out.\n\r\n\"It doesn't matter much to me.\"\n\r\nAnd John figures if things don't work out \"it doesn't matter much...\" because there is no way he is turning back and giving up on the road less traveled.\n\r\nThe next verse begins, \"No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.\"\n\r\nIt's apparent John is struggling with the notion that maybe he is not a genius after all. There's a saying, \"There's a fine line between genius and insanity,\" and John may, at that point in time, have questioned his sanity even for a brief time.\n\r\n\"That is you can't you know, tune in, but it's all right. That is I think it's not too bad.\"\n\r\nJohn lets us know that the mental state he is in is not a place where many minds \"tune in,\" \"but it's alright.\" John's okay with knowing his psychic state is not for everyone, but hopes that there are enough intelligent and well-informed people to acknowledge brilliance and a greater message. Lennon tapped into primal emotions that never left his consciousness.\n\r\n\"Always, know sometimes, think it's me, but you know I know when it's a dream.\"\n\r\nI don't have the facts here in front of me, but I'm guessing John's confused about who he is at times. He reassures us though that even when he may be in doubt and \"thinks it's him,\" he is quite certain he \"...know when it's a dream.\"\n\r\nBefore repeating the chorus one last time, John ends with, \"I think I know I mean a yes, but it's all wrong. That is I think I disagree.\"\n\r\nAgain, the fine line of genius and insanity is gripping. John want's to agree with society, but he knows society is \"all wrong,\" forcing him to disagree with it's direction and conditions. John felt mankind could build reality from it's dreams.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nLiving is easy with eyes closed \r\nMisunderstanding all you see\r\nYou won't find any better lyrics!\r\nJohn Lennon was a Genius!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\npoor john was never truly satisfied\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nUm, you guys know that \"strawberry fields\" is a slang term for acid, right?

This is so true when you think about how easy life is when you except things only superficially and don't utilize inquiry, but living life that way is not really living.  I think the rest of the song has to do with the struggle of staying true to oneself and confusion of who that is \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting hard to be someone\"  because there are so many road blocks in life; Loneliness: \"No one I think is in my tree\", confusion:  \"I think I know I mean a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0099\" and it so easy to go back to our old ways, which are easier in the moment, but don't really make us happy.  I think there might be some implications to drugs, but I feel that it has more to do with being lonely and wanting someone to escape the hardships of life because of the phrase  \"Let me take you down, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Cos I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to Strawberry Fields. Nothing is real\" that is repeated three times throughout the song.  Despite the obvious drug implication there is this struggle to take the easy road or hard road, which is good in the long run, but takes more to get there.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nThe song is definatly about LSD.

And an orphanage. I'm pretty sure John Lennon knew this, therefore wrote the song to have a double meaning as well. Songwriters always do this. It's what makes them smart. Don't get touchy over the LSD reference, its only acid, in a song written like 40 years ago.\r\nI think it's about escape either way you look at it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\nThe form of the song is one side of a conversation, lapsing into monologue in which Lennon's trying to explain to an imagined audience what it's like to be Lennon, see things the way he sees them.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u2026 has some interesting reportage on this song.\n\r\nLennon said \"I was different all my life. The second verse goes, 'No one I think is in my tree.' Well, I was too shy and self-doubting. Nobody seems to be as hip as me is what I was saying. Therefore, I must be crazy or a genius\u00e2\u0080\u0093'I mean it must be high or low'\"\n\r\nLennon described the song as \"psycho-analysis set to music\"\n\r\nThe problem he's trying to solve is how to be someone when a solitary genius (or fool, always the self-doubt) alone in a tree, on a wavelength nobody else can tune into, although he's reassuring us that the problem is not too bad for him.\n\r\nHe invites us to try on one of the solutions he has recourse to, which is a kind of nihilism.  \"Let me take you down to Strawberry Fields\", where \"nothing is real\" and consequently nothing matters enough that anybody is going to be hung (I suspect Lennon felt that people were going to hang him, for being too different (\"You know how hard it can be, the way things are going they're gonna crucify me,\" and I guess that's kinda prophetic in view of the way he died.)\n\r\nSo Lennon is describing one way he tries to cope with being different, seeing things differently (and perhaps more accurately than those around him,) by keeping his eyes closed, and by purposefully misunderstanding what he knows and sees.  Denying his gifts, perhaps.  It results in his own identity being eroded (\"getting hard to be someone\") but he's coping (\"but it's alright,\") and in any case \"it doesn't matter much to me\" ... perhaps he's saying he doesn't need to \"be someone.\"\n\r\nThis is a kind of nihilism.  Lennon presents it as a way of getting by, not being hung.  Of being by not being himself.  We see other instances of this nihilism in other Lennon songs, \"I know what it's like to be dead\"/\"making me feel like I've never been born\" and of his rejection of it.\n\r\nFinally, \"Always, no, *sometimes* think it's me,\" is, I think Lennon saying that he's reconciled to just being different but is seeking reassurance from the audience, \"but *you* know I know and it's a dream\" in which I think he is saying that at least the person to whom he's speaking knows that Lennon's perceptions aren't completely unreal, and that the rest of the world (as people see it) is not real.  So here, he's finally getting the courage to admit to himself (through his imaginary audience) that he in fact does possess unusual faculties, and is trusting in their validity.\n\r\nFinally, \"I think I know of thee, ah yes, but it's all wrong.  That is I think I disagree\" is how I've always heard the last lines.  I think he's now trying to apply his unique faculties to understanding or describe the imagined audience, his interlocutor, or perhaps more generally speaking of the possibility of knowing the other in their subjectivity (I find the use of 'thee' interesting, perhaps reflecting Buber's treatment of what Sartre called 'concrete relations with the Other', or perhaps just generally honouring the Other ... bear in mind, Lennon's just returned from the \"We're bigger than Jesus\" tour of the USA, and trying to deal with the absurdly extremely negative and irrational uproar of that.)\n\r\nIn any case, having \"taken us down\" to Strawberry Fields, Lennon's no closer to comprehending others and himself as part of the same world, but he has found the pure nihilism of Strawberry Fields untenable.\n\r\nIn Strawberry Fields, he's just asking, I think, to be understood (\"Love is asking to be loved.\")  I hope I have gone some way, not that it matters much to him.\n\n\n", "comment_15": "\nThere is no metaphors and stuff, Lennons method was to right a straight prose then mix it up randomly so it would not seem trite and obvious, and make him look deep like Dylan. \nif he didn't know there was no heaven he would be up there laughing at us all trying to sort out meanings that aren't there and bullshitting each other.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nWhat I hear in the 3rd vers is:\n\r\nAlways, no, sometimes think it's me\r\nBut you know I know when it's a dream\r\nI think a NO, a MEAN, a YES \r\nbut it's all wrong\r\nThat is I think I disagree\n\r\nIt would match the meaning of the previous verses, in the sense of him not tunning in with the rest (sometimes?)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nStrawberry Fields was aa orphanage near John's home in Liverpool.

It was recorded just after he composed it on a casette recorder in his home. It's like you're in there in the house. It's creepy in a good way.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_82": "\nHere's my analysis of Strawberry Fields (probably my favorite Beatles song):\n\r\nFirst off, I don't think it's \"about\" drugs.  It might contain references to drug-induced experiences, or been written either under the influence of them or as a result of having been, but that really doesn't mean anything.  Use of pot or hallucinogens will affect your outlook on the world and influence your creative endeavors, as will many other experiences, but to say that \"this song is about drugs\" is extremely simple-minded.\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I believe this song is about the concept of building one's own reality out of dreams (both literal and figurative dreams), fantasies, and delusions.  Retreating into one's own dream-world is a concept that's hardly unique to this song.  What makes Strawberry Fields unique, however, is that it takes the conept a step further, by not only retreating into a fantasy, but by actually realizing it to the extent that you can invite someone else to join you, hence the chorus: \n\r\n\"Let me take you down, 'cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields\r\nNothing is real, and nothing to get hungabout\r\nStrawberry Fields forever\"\n\r\nHowever, the song also deals with the inherrant issues with the idea of dream-reality-living, which is that, over time, the lines between your fantasy and the real world can erode, leaving behind feelings of contradiction and confusion.  What's more, it ultimately proves impossible for another to live (though she might try) entirely within your own fantasy world, as he realizes over the course of the song.  In each verse, this progression is evident as the singer's views become more confused and unsure of himself.\n\r\n\"Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see\r\nIt's getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it doesn't matter much to me \"\n\r\nThe first verse clearly acknowledges that he is not living in the \"real world\", and that he's even losing his \"real world\" identity, but that it scarcely matters, because the world he IS living in is an easy one to grow accustomed to and enjoy, and this is all he really needs.\n\r\n\"No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low\r\nThat is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right, that is I think it's not too bad\"\n\r\nHe realizes in the second verse that he's more lonely here than originally intended.  The one he wants to share his dream world with can't entirely tune into it, and he finds himself alone there.  What mattered little in the first verse is now noticed, but bearable. \"that is, I think it's not too bad\"\n\r\n\"Always, no sometimes, think it's me, but you know I know when it's a dream\r\nI think I know I mean a \"Yes\" but it's all wrong, that is I think I disagree\"\n\r\nThese lyrics make little sense, and I'm fairly certain the lyrics listed on this site are innacurate, as I've always seen (and heard) this final verse as:\n\r\n\"Always, no sometimes, think it's me, but you know I know when it's a dream\r\nI think, er, no... I mean, er, \"Yes\", but it's all wrong.  That is I think I disagree\"\n\r\nAssuming the latter lyrics are the correct ones, the final verse shows the singer's final acknowledgement that his reality is nothing but a dream, and one that he can't feel fulfilled living in exclusively.  His confusion in this verse is very blatant, as he stammers over lines and corrects himself, trying to remain positive, but in the end, admitting that it's all wrong.\n\r\nWhat is left up to conjecture, of course, is how it ends, whether he comes back to true reality or whether he's too far gone.  The repeated \"strawberry fields forever\" at the end of the song might imply the latter.  As for \"Strawberry Fields\" itself, I think the fact that it's an orphanage in england is fairly irrelevant, because for the purpose of the song, it's simply a symbolic place or state of existance, and dwelling on why he chose it as his symbol rather than some other place is a mundane excercise.\n\r\nInterestingly, Paul's \"Penny Lane\", released as the B-side on the strawberry fields single, is about a similar concept.  However, where Strawberry fields is about the singer actually attempting to live in his dream world, and dealing with the benefits, challanges, and consequences of doing so, Penny Lane simply takes the form of an idle daydream.  \"There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back, on Penny Lane...\", \"Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes\" and \"And though she feels as if she's in a play, she is anyway\" all drive the concept home.  IMO, Strawberry fields is a much more powerful song due to the extent to which it delves into the idea of waking dreams, whereas Penny lane takes a very superficial (though also inspired and catchy) view of daydreams.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_83": "\nStrawberry Fields was one of the two really famous houses in Woolton (where John grew up) and it was an old Victorian house (built on a strawberry farm) that was converted into a home for salvation army orphans.

A very vacant field, no buildings or modern things, but explosive with colours.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:\n\r\nOn the Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) All the people are looking at a freshly dug grave.\n\r\n2.) Paul is holding the musical instrument cor anglais, and it is black, symbolizing death, and the only Beatle holding a black instrument. Where Paul is holding it with his left hand (being left-handed) he is displaying three fingers, meaning only three Beatles left?\n\r\n3.) This was the first album on Apple Records and the first album that the group wrote their name as \"Beatles,\" rather than \"The Beatles.\" This is inferred to mean that they are no longer a whole as in \"The,\" but now since there are only three, it is just \"Beatles.\"\n\r\n4.) The yellow hyacinth in the shape of a left-handed guitar only has three strings.\n\r\n5.) The doll in the red, black and white stripes has a car model on her lap next to her right hand. This model with red interior is supposed to mean the car in which Paul was killed and the red interior is blood.\n\r\n6.) The other three Beatles' are standing sideways behind the drum, except Paul who is standing forward.\n\r\n7.) On the drum is written in the center \"Lonely Hearts.\" Using a mirror, place it perpendicular to the center of the drum. Splitting the words \"Lonely Hearts\" in half, the combined writing reads - 1 ONE 1 X HE DIE. This means that the \"1 One 1\" equal three, or that Paul is gone, and the \"X\" is meant to cross out Paul. Between the words \"HE\" and \"DIE\" is an arrow that points directly to Paul.\n\r\n8.) The hand raised over Paul's head, is to mean \"death.\"\n\r\nThe Back Cover:\n\r\n1.) Paul is facing the back, which can mean that he is an imposter, or that he is dead.\n\r\n2.) George's right-hand index finger is pointing directly to the words \"five o'clock,\" the supposed time of the car crash.\n\r\n3.) That the song lyrics \"Within You, Without You,\" are printed over Paul's body.\n\r\nThe Songs:\n\r\n1.) Lovely Rita:\"When I caught a glimpse of Rita,\" and \"I took her home, I nearly made it.\"\n\r\n2.) A Day In The Life: \" He blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had changed. A crowd of people stood and stared, they'd seen his face before...\" \n\r\n3.) Good Morning, Good Morning: \"Nothing to do to save his life.\" \"People running around it's five o'clock.\" \n\r\n4.) She's Leaving Home: \"Wednesday morning at five o'clock.\"\n\r\n5.) Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: The reference to Billy Shears is supposed to be that of William (Billy) Campbell, the look-alike.\n\r\nMagical Mystery Tour\n\r\nThe Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) Paul is alleged to be the one in the \"black\" walrus suit.\n\r\n2.) In the booklet, Ringo's drums read \"Love the 3 Beatles.\"\n\r\n3.) In the picture where The Beatles' are wearing white tails, Paul is the only one with a black carnation, the other three have red. \n\r\n4.) When you hold the album cover to a mirror, the word \"Beatles\" is a phone number, which is 2317438. It has been said that if you had called this number back then, a recording came on saying, \"you're getting closer.\" Of course there is no area code etc., so I doubt this one too.\n\r\nThe Songs:\n\r\n1.) I Am The Walrus: At the end of the song, where the spoken words from the play King Lear are placed, you here \"O, untimely death!\" and of course as we know, \"The Walrus Was Paul.\"\n\r\n2.) Strawberry Fields Forever: When John Lennon says in the end of the song the words \"Cranberry Sauce,\" it was long believed to be he saying \"I Buried Paul.\" However, it was electronically manipulated to sound like he was saying \"I Buried Paul\" but he actually isn't. 3.) All You Need Is Love: At the end, Lennon says, \"Yes, he's dead.\"\n\r\nYellow Submarine\n\r\nThe Front and Back Covers\n\r\n1.) Lennon's hand raised over Paul's head, indicating \"death.\"\n\r\nThe Beatles (The White Album)\n\r\n1.) Glass Onion: The term used for a coffin with a glass top.\n\r\n2.) 'Don't Pass Me By: \"You were in a car crash....\"\n\r\n3.) Revolution 9: The words, \"Number nine, number nine,\" repeated many times are supposed to say when played backwards, \"dead man, turn me on dead man.\" The reference to the number 9 is supposed to be that of McCartney having nine letters.\n\r\nAbbey Road\n\r\nThe Front Cover:\n\r\n1.) The common meaning of the Beatles' dress - Lennon in white for a priest, Ringo as the undertaker, George as the grave digger, and of course Paul, in his bare feet, holding a cigarette in his right hand (being lefty) all means death.\n\r\n2,) The police vehicle parked to the right in the photograph is a morgue wagon. \n\r\n3.) The Volkswagen parked on the left side of the street has a tag that reads, \"LMW 28IF. This has been construed to mean \"LMW - Linda McCartney Weeps\" and the \"28IF\" means that Paul would have been 28 years old IF he had lived\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_143": "\noh and the song doesnt go ''...i think i know i mean a yes...''          its '' i think A NO means A YES but its all wrong...'' .        plus it makes much more sense.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_144": "\ni think it is about multiple things that are perhaps unknow because john is dead.but,i think strawberry fields is a dream.and in your dreams it seems like foreverand in your dreams there is nothing to worry about because nothing is real.when you are a child things are easy but when you grow up you see things and you misinterpret which leads to mischief.an when they sing their nonscese part they are interpreting that there is different meanin or they are arguing over something.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_145": "\ni don't think this song is THAT incredible deep.\r\ni think why he says strawberry fields are because of the marks on his arm from injecting heroine.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_146": "\nThe most common tale is that on Wednesday, 9 November 1966 at 5 am, McCartney, while working on the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, stormed out of a recording session after an argument with the other Beatles and rode off in his Austin-Healey, which he subsequently crashed.[5]\n\r\nThe story was largely pieced together by fans from the lyrics of several Beatles songs. The most common narrative includes the following pieces of evidence: \"He didn't notice that the lights had changed\" (\"A Day in the Life\") because he was busy watching the pretty girl on the pavement (the eponymous meter maid of \"Lovely Rita\") after narrowly missing her dressed in blue (she's said to be the blur on the back of Abbey Road) jaywalking (\"Blue Jay Way\"). He then crashed into a lamp-post (a car crash sound is heard in \"Revolution 9\" and \"A Day in the Life\"). He was pronounced dead on a \"Wednesday morning at 5 o'clock as the day begins\" (\"She's Leaving Home\"), and nobody found out this because the news was withheld: \"Wednesday morning papers didn't come\" (\"Lady Madonna\"). A funeral procession was held days later (as supposedly implied in the Abbey Road album cover). Adding fuel to the legend is the ending of \"Strawberry Fields Forever.\" Some believed John said \"I buried Paul\" in a slow deep voice over the final refrain. He later refuted that, stating that he said \"cranberry sauce.\"\n\r\nAccording to believers, McCartney was replaced with the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest. The name of this look-alike has been recorded as William Shears Campbell, Billy Shears (the name of the fictitious leader of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band), William Sheppard (based on the inspiration for the song \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\"), or some combination of the names.\n\r\nThere is no evidence of any sort of car crash in which McCartney was involved, although during the first week of January 1967, McCartney's custom-made Mini Cooper was wrecked by a friend on the M1 Motorway outside London. McCartney was involved in a moped crash on December 26, 1965, which resulted in a chipped tooth and the scar on his lip that can be seen on promotional videos for the \"Paperback Writer\"/\"Rain\" single, made shortly after the crash, in May 1966. According to McCartney, his desire to hide the scar on his lip was the impetus to grow a moustache; at about the same time the other three Beatles grew moustaches as well\u00e2\u0080\u0094in time for Sgt.

After 69 years of it's existence the decision to close the orphanage was made by the Salvation Army this past January. The three remaining children who were living at Strawberry Field had been placed foster homes or under the control of Liverpool's social services. \r\nThe reason for the closure stems from a major policy shift by Liverpool's City Council which has seen a larger number of children placed in foster homes as opposed to institutions (foster care families actually doubled for the 2003-04 period thereby decreasing the demand for children being placed into orphanages.)\r\n\"It's a Salvation Army home that was near the house I lived in with my auntie in the suburbs,\" said John Lennon in a September 1980 interview with David Sheff for Playboy when describing Strawberry Field. \"There were two famous houses there. One was owned by Gladstone, which was a reformatory for boys, which I could see out my window. And Strawberry Fields was just around the corner from that. It was an old Victorian house  converted for the Salvation Army orphans, as a kid I used to go to their garden parties with my friends Ivan, Nigel and Pete. We'd all go up there and hang out and sell lemonade for a penny and we always had fun at Strawberry Fields.\r\n\"Apparently, it used to be farm that made strawberries or whatever. I don't know. But I just took the name,\" exclaimed Lennon, \"it had nothing to do with the Salvation Army. As an image -- Strawberry Fields forever.\"\r\n\"I remember John Lennon sneaking into our garden parties from the back gate,\" said former 63-year-old resident Pat Fitt of Wavertree. \"The children who played around always wanted to know about the home.\" On the closing of Strawberry Field, Ms. Fitt lamented: \"It was a wonderful place and I made great friends there.\"  According to Kate Mansey of the Liverpool Daily Post, \"Ms. Fitt arrived at Strawberry Field as a three-year-old in 1944\" and that \"she worked at the home until 1991.\"\r\nThe final day saw staff \"working this morning to move everything out\" of the Strawberry Field. Said Assistant Manager Peter Burns: \"It is a very sad day for all the staff as it is the last day the children will cease to be a working children's home.\r\n\"It has been a very emotional time for all the children and staff. I can't praise the staff enough. They have been 100% committed to the children and the home over the years - so much so that it has become like another family for them.\"\r\nOf the 26 staff members who ran Strawberry Field, only a few staff members will stay behind until August to clear up the remaining administrative tasks.  And as to the fate of the building itself, no decision has been yet made but Sheila Powell, 69, who was one of the first who was taken into care at the orphanage pines: \"It is wrong for them to close Strawberry Fields. The Salvation Army were my only parents and now I hope that the building is put to good use - as a holiday home for children for example.\"\n\r\n... more on the website...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_163": "\nThis song relaxes me.

In MOzart's operas, for example, he insisted that the words were always secondary to the song -- so the librettist had to write the words in a way that would best realize the voice (for example more vowells).  When you think about that, you realize that a good song, like this one, should never be broken apart into words and lyrics.  Instead we should be thinking about the combination.  On the music side, there is a continuous and regular declension of both the background music and the melody (the notes Let me take you down, literally travel down on the scale).  This creates a feeling of settling, indeed a rapid feeling of submersion, emotionally.  A second thing to notice in the music is the way the stringed isntruments break in upon the song in fragments, drums too, all ending in a sound very similar to an orchestra tuning up before a performance.  The overall effect gives the listener a sense of the uncanny, the unfamiliar, and yet the settled. Musically we have been drawn down into an underworld of settled strageness, where we could imagine carnival acrobats upside down.  The lyrics compliment this musical sense of the unfamiliar and awkward.  They, like the music, appear as chunks of order.  Nevertheless, the overall meaning of the lyrics escapes us.  Through the use of uncanny musical form which nevertheless HAS structure, Lennon manages to get his audience to imagine that his uncanny words also have meaning. It is feeling, not meaning, that Lennon intends to evoke in his audience, however, the feeling of uncanniness.  That is the genious of the song.  How many rock songs were doing that in the 1960's?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_179": "\nbahahahaha cranberry sauce! sooo random loves itttt\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_180": "\nI LOVE THE BEATLES\r\n~the spaceman lives~\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_181": "\nhow the hell did the \"I buried Paul\" thing ever start?

Strawberry Fields is where you daydream at. It's your imaginary place where everything is ok, it's your escape from reality. So the chorus is basically saying that he is leaving reality where there is nothing to be upset about because nothing is real, and he's wishing he could stay in this imaginary place forever. The first verse is pretty self-explanatory. Life is easy, when you never stop to realize what's going on or think about things and just accept whatever society or religion or government tell you to believe. But in the end none of it matters, because nothing ever really changes. The second verse is saying that he feels like he's all alone and that nobody sees things the way he does or thinks the way he does, because they can't \"tune in,\" but it's ok, he accepts it and doesn't let himself feel lonely or isolated or separated from everyone else as a result of it, he lets it be. I think the last verse is about how sometimes when you can feel so different from everyone else, you can almost experience this disassociation with everything. I think he's saying that sometimes he feels like true reality is only a dream, so he's confused about what's real, not in any literal sense like if the building he's looking at is real or not, but in a more perceived sense, like is society really like this? Is government really like this? Are people really being genuine and true when they are doing these things?
