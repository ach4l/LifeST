{"comment_0": "\nShe's reminiscing about a love that she had during the time and it brings her \"summertime sadness.\" \n\r\nThis person is someone who made her feel electric, alive, and in love. She feels so invincible with this person that she could die and still be happy. Thinking about how much she loved this person and how this person may have been the best person she's ever been with, it brings her sadness. \"Even if you're gone, I'm going to drive.\" Yes, this person isn't a part of her life anymore, but she relives her relationship with him by driving down memory lane.\n\r\nDoes anyone else hear \"I think I'll miss you forever like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies\"? That makes more sense to me than \"I think I'll love you forever.\" \r\n\"I think I'll miss you forever\r\nLike the stars miss the sun in the morning sky.\r\nLate is better than never.\r\nEven if you're gone, I'm gonna drive.\"\r\nThis is my favorite part of the song. It's as if she finally realized how much she's going to miss this person and has finally told them her true feelings. Even though he's gone, she's going to remember and honor how wonderful this time period of her life was. Beautiful...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nNice. Everybody is so focused in partnership love.\n\r\nI actually watched a Video, where there was a girl involved, not a guy. Though even before that I already thought it might be someone like a sister, someone who's not completing Lana like a partner would, but is/was exactly like her, a real soulmate. It seems, the sister wanted to suicide, and though Lana didn't, they understood each other enough, that Lana didn't want to stop her, just make sure she says goodbye.\n\r\nNow when she's gone, Lana keeps doing everything they might have done together (partys, cars, what young girls can do), like in a trance, so she won't break down over her death, still feeling everything they felt together, but also (summertime) sadness and emptiness. And now she's not scared to die anymore, though she moves on. A little bit of an empty shell.\n\r\nIrritating might be the \"kiss me hard\" part, though girls/sisters can kiss without beeing lesbian, too. On the cheeks, or it might be a greeting or some sort of code...\n\r\nBesides: sisterhood might be much stronger. Usually the most people fall in love, lose the loved (without them dying), fall in love with someone else, lose them, fall in love again... but a sister you can lose only once (more or less).\n\r\nAnyway... just my thoughts...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI think this is her reliving some sort of fast-paced, almost destructive relationship with a guy. You know, one of those \"I'm deeply, dramatically in love with you, I'll die without you\" kind of things that almost every girl has at one point. And now, she's looking back with melancholy nostalgia, because it was passionate and dramatic and beautiful, but also not meant to last. The whole summertime sadness is the beauty of this ephemeral relationship that ended too fast, and can never be recovered.\n\r\n\"Oh, my God, I feel it in the air\r\nTelephone wires above all sizzlin' like your stare\r\nHoney I'm on fire I feel it everywhere\r\nNothing scares me anymore\"\n\r\nHere she's remembering it, and feels like she's so much more wise and experienced from this.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nTotal obsessional love, the Lana Del Rey all-in masochistic approach to relationships.\n\r\nHer guy leaves her as the Summer begins. Since she's addicted to him like a drug, her Summer (which should be a good time of year) isn't. She sings \"I think I'll miss you forever.\" She will never get over him. With him, she could die happy. Without him, she just wants to die. That's her summertime sadness.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThere is only one thing that I can think of that is inherently and characteristically sad about summer & that is the fact that it has to end/is temporary. It seems like Lana is singing about something that is happening and she knows its great and enjoying every bit of it that she can, but she also knows that it has to end eventually & how much she will miss it once it's gone.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nShe has lost someone dear to her.  A lover, I think, because of the line, \"kiss me hard before you go.\"  This *could* be directed at a close female friend or sister or other family member but to me the line is more passionate and sexual than that.  I hug my little sister hard when I'm not going to see her for a while.  I kiss my lover goodbye.\n\r\nShe feels his presence this summer, as she does every summer because it is the season in which he died.  The elements remind her of him and freshen her fading memories.  It could be his spirit or wishful thinking but it's all the same to her.  It's been a while since she lost him.  She misses him madly and is somewhat happy just to feel him around.  Which is why she tells him, \"Kiss me hard before you go.\"  She knows when the summer ends she will have to go back to trying to live without him, instead of just letting the depression consume her as she does at this time of the year.  I think it is this idea that inspires her to commit suicide in the first place.  She can't bear the thought of going back to trying to forget him.\n\r\nOh, my God, I feel it in the air\r\nTelephone wires above all sizzling like your stare\r\nHoney I'm on fire I feel it everywhere\r\nNothing scares me anymore\n\r\nShe feels his intense gaze on her (\"sizzling like your stare\") as she she dolls herself up for the occasion.  She is sort of delirious and euphoric at the idea of being reunited with her lover in the afterlife.  She feels \"alive\" and \"on fire.\" She feels this energy \"in the air\" and all around her.    She's not afraid.  Nothing could ever hurt her worse than losing him did.\n\r\n\"Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99\r\nGot my bad baby by my heavenly side\r\nI know if I go, I'll die happy tonight\"\n\r\nShe senses him in the passenger seat as she speeds down the road and this gives her confidence.  If her suicide attempt is successful, she knows she will die happy.\n\r\n\"I think I'll miss you forever\r\nLike the stars miss the sun in the morning skies\r\nLate is better than never\r\nEven if you're gone I'm gonna drive, drive\"\n\r\nIt has been so long and she still misses him deeply.  Because it doesn't hurt any less now than it ever did she thinks it won't ever get any better.  She considers the possibility that they may never be together again.  They are so close, yet so far.  She's a bird who is in love with a fish.  She doesn't care.  Even if he really is lost to her forever she would rather bet her life on the chance of being with him again than go on without him.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nWe've all had the too good to be true type feeling. While it's happening, it's already beginning to dissipate. The excitement which overcomes us, triggers the fear that over take us. Whether it's a passionate summer fling that burned quickly or a long lasting relationship that started on fire but never really quite caught on. Either way, the chemistry seems to be unmatched by any other flame that's lit or died out.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nI've listened to the song and watched the video quite a few times. So, I think that this song is about moving on from an ex-boyfriend/girlfriend who has passed away, maybe unexpectedly. Lana sings that she's sad he/she died, but she is trying to move on, even though she will always miss him/her. Kinda like the Power of Goodbye by Madonna. She tries to kiss goodbye the summertime sadness that his/her death brought her. \n\nI think the \"drive\" part could be about moving on, but also, like Lahhva said, could be about reminiscing on their time together and celebrate their past relationship. Have no regrets and only remember the best. \n\nThe video is interesting, because it is quite literal to the song, except that the roles are reversed and the ending is not so positive. Lana (I'll use the actors' names) is the one dying by committing suicide. Jaime King is wearing the red dress and drives a car with her bad baby (i.e. Lana) on her heavenly side. However, unlike in the song, Jaime fails to move on and commits suicide. \n\nFinally, I find it interesting that the girls don't end up together in heaven. I think it means that the relationship was passionate love - that is, it was a summer love more than anything. It was not going to last a lifetime anyway. In short, they were not soul mates, but they had fun for a short period of time. In the song, Lana embraces that part of her life before embarking on another chapter. \n\nAnyway, that's my interpretation. Great song and video!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nIn two different articles and Wikipedia, they're described as lesbian lovers in the music video. I took it as though they were lovers, it just had that kind of feel to the video with certain shots of them together in romantic ways. If some of you are refusing they're lesbians because you're biggots, then fuck off with your stupidity.The rest of you that refuse they're not lesbian lovers, just passionate about eachother, could be.

These feelings are even more prominent in the summer cause that's when he died. Its also about her trying to kill herself cause she can't live with that sadness. So she puts on her red dress, does up her hair (looking her best for their reunion) and is driving hard (I'm guessing that's how he went out too). Where she says \"got my bad baby by my heavenly side\" she's imagining him beside her staring at her, almost like he's waiting for her \"blissful\" death to be with him (my sis says she thinks she's stoned lol)\r\nMy take on it: its a beautiful song about painful nostalgia and suicide.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\ncrying so hard rn, lana del crey, etc.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nFor the meaning of \"Summertime Sadness,\" I think it's not completely about a boy. I think that she has actually diagnosed herself as having a case of \"Summertime Sadness\" and someone or something has made her realize that she should be happy to be alive and so she tells \"Summertime Sadness\" to kiss her hard before it leaves her forever. Maybe the boy who's in the car with her is responsible for allowing her to come out of her shell of sadness. She also lets \"Summertime Sadness\" know that it was the best for her because if she had never gone through all of her sadness, then she wouldn't have come out of it a lot more daring and stronger than ever.\n\r\n\"I think I'll love you forever like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies.\"\r\n\"Late is better than never.\" \"Even if I'm gone I'm gonna drive.\"\n\r\n^I think at that point, you can clearly see where I'm coming from. She said that late is better than never, meaning that even though she knows that some people get over things pretty quickly, for some it's not so easy and it takes a little longer. She just happened to be one of the people who took a little longer, but at least she got over her sadness and she happily asserts her new positive outlook on life by saying that even if she's gone, she's still going to drive.\n\r\nIn closing, I'll also like to say that in my own personal opinion, this song also inspires spontaneity. I am a boy, but maybe I'll put on a red dress without any high heels on a wear my hair in \"big beauty queen style.\" Just kidding, but my point is that it makes me want to step out of my comfort zone sometimes.\n\r\nWith the western flare that this song has, I envision myself on a highway with someone I love with this song blasting from the open windows of my car while strong winds embrace us.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nHaha I hear \"sizzling like a snail\".

I just wanted you to know, that baby you're the best.\" Girls especially show their love for their best friends in numerous ways. Just because she says \"kiss\" doesn't mean it's a guy. It's like when close friends greet each other they kiss each other on the cheeks and hug,etc. So she's saying how she wants to see her best friend one last time to tell her how much she meant to her and how much she loves her. \n\r\n\"Nothing scares me anymore.\" I feel like she's saying that when her best friend passed it was it was the worst thing to ever happen to her and how nothing else can compare to it.\n\r\n\"I'm feeling electric tonight, cruising down the coast going 'bout 99. Got my bad baby by my heavenly side, I know if I go I'll die happy tonight.\" Honestly I'm not really sure about this part but I thinks she's either talking about the memories she's had with her best friend or that she's trying to commit suicide as well to try to be with her best friend again, hence \"I'll die happy tonight.\".\n\r\n\"I think I'll miss you forever, like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies.\"\r\nI think she meant that she misses her best friend but will never see her again because she belongs to the sun, and Lana will always be a star. The sun also once started out as a star, but now has become a bigger entity. This shows how her best friend was once with her but she either died or moved on, intent on not giving her a second chance.\n\r\n\"Late is better than never, even if you're gone I'm gonna drive.\"\r\nShe's saying how even though she killed herself she happy with all the memories they had together and all the times she got to be with her.

I remember listening to this song sometime last year, playing it over and over again and feeling that kind of summertime sadness in me. \n\nI think the song is about saying goodbye to someone, letting go of someone special to you, but instead of being sad about it, you see the good thing about the relationship and how it made you a better person. It's a beautiful song, a reminder of how we should see goodbyes in a different light. For me it was one of those things that I always try and find every time something good has to end, it's hard for me to let people go but at the same time, it's just one of those things that need to happen. \n\nI love the fact that she used summertime to describe the kind of sadness that she's feeling. It gives the song a more positive sound. During summer seasons, people are more likely to be happier, with the sun shining out every morning, you can't help but just smile to it as it represents another day of sunshine in your life.  It's like the idea of \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was good while it lasted\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and the acceptance that you have to just let it go and be happy about it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nSome lyrics are never quite understood as writers can have mixed emotions. \r\nMy interpretation is mixed. Some say suicidal lyrics,. Some say a summertime lover,. Ex partner. At first I believed it was a suicidal sadness song.

'Born To Die'\n\r\nKiss me hard before you go, summertime sadness. \r\nInterp: that summer was her ultimate and untimely sadness. Kiss me hard before you go,. She knew deep down without her approval,.someone was about to make a permanent exit in her life.\r\nI just wanted you to know,. That baby you were the best.\r\nInt: her deepest thoughts on that person who was her baby...needed to know they were the best her one true love.\r\nRed dress on- oh my god I feel it everywhere.\r\nInt: Lana is happy and about to party or has just come home from one,. Maybe even high...She is in bliss. Until she feels a state of sudden anxiety,. And her intuition is telling her something has.. Gone. \r\nTelephone lines above-nothing scares me anymore.\r\nInt: wherever she was at the time,. She was unreachable on her telephone,.  and perhaps friends or family passed on the news... And the lines were sizzling like a snare. \r\nHoney I'm on fire,. I feel it everywhere.. nothing scares me anymore.\r\nInt: she feels a sudden rage of passion, denial,.shock,.anger,. Agony, grief,. And then decides that nothing can ever hurt her worse than the pain she felt when that person left her.\n\r\nI'm feeling electric tonight- oh my god I feel it everywhere.\r\nInt: Lana is reminiscing or even perhaps dreaming/remembering a moment most fondest to her which she shared with her 'bad baby by her heavenly side'  together 'cruising down the coast ,. Doin bout 99' when she felt most alive and happy. Which only reverts back to a shattered reality because it is summertime again and he is but a memory and it lingers on and will remind her off loss every summertime which has become her own 'Summertime Sadness' as she sings,. 'Got that summertime,. Summertime sadness'... As if it's no surprise to her or others around her.. It's a given that she will mourn each summer for him.\n\n\r\nThink I'll miss you forever-even if you're gone I'm gonna drive.\r\nInt: It's no doubt Lana feels a loss. Music suddenly intensifies. Lana's voice heightens. Her emotions voice an angelic message to her loved one.\r\nThe stars never see the Sun, they are in the same sky but will remain separate forever. It's of great pain to Lana that that is how her sorrow is beautifully described.\r\nLate is better than never:\r\nFinally letting go of the pain is better late than never letting go of the pain at all .. Perhaps it was more than a few summertimes of heartache before Lana could even attempt to try and say goodbye to her true love.\n\r\nEven if you're gone I'm gonna drive.\r\nInt: This could be interpreted many ways.\r\nBut I assume that Lana has decided to come to terms with the grief and loss the best way she can and decides she will go on and succeed in her life and dreams and musical talent,. Which was more than likely discussed many times with her lost loved one. \r\nThe chorus again comes in.\r\nLana wants one final hard kiss goodbye to the hurtful memory and agony of her lost love she refers to as her Summertime Sadness.

She already knows the girl is contemplating suicide, and Lana isn't necessarily talking her out of it, but reminding the girl of what she felt about her before she committed suicide. It could be really hard to guess what the real meaning is, but you can relate it to suicide an awful lot. I've been hearing so much suicide this year, and it's sad. I do wish people who commit suicide knew they were loved and there are people who thought a lot about them.

Summertime usually represents a hot time and in life it relates to a time of sexuality, though with bipolar this state can be mixed with a sort of intense sadness and melancholia which can almost 'heighten' the experience; it's a sort of euphoria, hence she states about it that at  least she'll die happy tonight\".

The other lyrics are about her obvious love for her partner (male/female?), and how she wouldn't mind dying by his/her side.

Maybe she was with a guy that broke her heart and at that time she was fragile and well... Sad! So i think she is just saying goodbye to that horrible time in her life. Now she feels alive. I love it when she says \"Got my bad baby on my heavenly side. Oh if I go, Ill die happy tonight.\" I think that shows that she has found someone new that she loves and now she is not afraid of death and she living her life to the fullest and telling \"Summertime Sadness\" to kiss her goodbye because now she feels better than ever!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_37": "\nI think that the song alone (I'm not talking about the video) is about a girl and a boy who met over the summer and the girl fell in love, but she knows that they won't be together because for some reason they're never going to see each other again and she feels like she can't go on living without him.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_38": "\nThis is just my opinion. She is remembering her past life which ended during the summertime by suicide. The first person (who died) is her life before, when she was also a woman, and it is like that woman is still with her. The second person is her today, reminiscing about the good times as if those memories are a tangible person. That life was full of beauty and tragedy, a raw deal in the end. The electric feeling is a realization, and \"Oh my God!\" is the feeling that overwhelms her when she realizes it. She consoles herself by remembering and that brings peace to her prior self. \"Kiss me hard\" and \"you're the best\" is a way of saying goodbye, a eulogy, something you say when you'll never see someone again. \"Nothing scares me anymore\" because she's been there, done that. I also feel that her entire body of work is based on this theme, portrayed very artistically from different points of view. If you watch her videos it isn't hard to figure out the time period.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_39": "\nlesbians? really?? \nI think a lot of you are being too literal. Especially with the video.. \n\nThey are not lesbians, sorry to break it to you.\nthere is no evidence in the video linking them as a couple.\n\nAnyways, what i think the VIDEO is about:\n\nLana is most likely a ghost/angel/whatever, she jumped to her death, and now shes watching this random non lesbian girl jump to her's. you watch both of their lives flash before their eyes. This other girl obviously dies and you watch her turn into a ghost/angel/whatever also (she goes from wearing the red dress while alive, to wearing the white dress during all the smokey effects  after she jumps.)\n\nBut anyways, What I think the SONG is about is very simple-\n\n-instead of focusing on each and every single word, i think about the \"picture\" as a whole. obviously its about suicide, and love. \n\nsummertime sadness is just a phrase, a catchy phrase, that lana came up with, to sing a million times in the song. after all, thats what most songs are nowadays.. repetition.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_40": "\nI believe this song is about being sad in the summer time\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_41": "\nWhat i took it as, Was when she says \"Kiss me before you go\" she was talking to her lover, and he was going off to the war or some conflict. And when she says shes feeling alive\" she is possibly high on something. When she says \"I just want you to know that you are the best\" shes talking to him spiritually. The same thing is seen in a sense when she says\" Driving down the coast goin bout 99, Got my bad baby by my heavenly side\" Means that he has died and that when she says that \"if I go I'll be happy tonight\" Indicating that if she does die going close to 100 mph she would be happy because she would be with her lover once again.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_42": "\nI think it's about a lost lover. Someone who has passed away. When she says 'Kiss me before you go' She wishes that they could say goodbye to her lost lover or she's saying goodbye to the people she's leaving behind when she goes to be with that lover. 'I'll dye happy tonight' She says because she is happy that she will soon be with her lost lover. When I say lost lover I mean passed away lover. 'I got my red dress on tonight' and 'got my hair up real big beauty queen star' means she has dressed up for her and her lover's meeting in heaven.

Her voice, her songwriting, her music videos, completely and utterly awesome. \r\nAfter listening to this song (basically on repeat!) and reading these lyrics, this is how I interpret Summertime Sadness; \r\nShe is recalling the memories she's had with someone special (probably a partner or a close friend) that had either died or just gone away. \r\nI think lana is also just setting the mood of 'summertime sadness.' When your meant to be feeling so happy like everyone else when really your not, and there is more feelings of sadness and loss beneath the surface. \n\r\nEveryone that reads this MUST watch the music video cos it's really good!! :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_46": "\nThis song is absolutely amazing and I discovered it when I was going through a \"summertime sadness,\" I interpret this song in a way I was feeling last summer. I fell in love with someone who had to move across the country at the end of summer. \n\nI think this song is about a summer relationship/fling that was so rare and absolutely indescribable . She is so in love with him, and had so many amazing moments with him but knows he will be leaving soon...knows she should guard her heart but doesn't care and embraces the time she does have with him... even though she knows the more time she spends with him, the worse it will be when they part. When he parts they kiss goodbye, and they both know how they feel about one another but nothing can help the situation. She will always miss him and maybe sometime later in life they can be with one another.

Like sister kind of relationship. The line \"Kiss me hard before you go\" is not in a romantic way, it's in the family-relationship kind of way.

The line \"kiss me hard before you go\" is really the one line that indicates it is about a lost lover and not just a close friend or sibling.\n\r\nIn light of that, I'm thinking the video is about a woman remembering her lesbian lover who has passed away.

I think the song is based around  two girls who are best friends. Girls can show off their love very passionately even through friendship, I don't think the song is meant to be taken in the context of lovers. I think that the girl with  the short blonde hair committed suicide and Lana is reminiscing their memories together while also trying to figure out why she committed suicide, trying to feel what she felt. Lana by saying \"I just wanted you to know, that baby you're the best\" it's like she was trying to help her and prevent her from committing suicide. I know from first hand experience and I can relate to this song, when a friend of yours is very depressed and contemplating suicide you try everything to stop it and repeatedly tell them they're better then that, but in the end we never really understand.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_59": "\nI certainly agree with Tippy Toes comments, as in my reply.

The song has a timeless, general meaning that can relate to anyone in any context or relationship  it's basically saying: the absence or loss of a true love, is corruptive and detrimental. This is epitomised in her suicide\r\n\"Summertime Sadness\" to me, is an ironic juxtaposition of two polar opposites \r\n\"summertime\" brings connotations of happiness, sun, holidays, love ect thus combining this emotive word with sadness emphasises how depressed she must feel now that even summertime can't make her happy\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_65": "\nI've heard it's about how her boyfriend passed away and her new boyfriend doesn't love her as much as her boyfriend who passed away did.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_66": "\nTo me the song is about a lesbian couple who's love is like infinity, but one commits suicide and the girl is so sad but can't let her go.
