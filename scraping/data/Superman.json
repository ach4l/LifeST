{"comment_0": "\nDude, it's a *parody!*  \n\r\nEminem's just making fun of all those songs out there that are like \"I think I love you baby, I think I love you too...\"  etc.  He's basically saying that they're full of shit and guys who say those things are most likey paying their girl lip service to score.\n\r\nHe's also saying (between the lines) that girls who buy this BS are stupid; he's not slamming females in general.\n\r\nIt's strange how intellegent his lyrics can be.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nim sure a lot of people are gonna get pissed off by this song but im a feminist, and i think this song is kind of sad.  it says a lot about him.  His mother was a drug addict, and it sounds like his wife was a cheating drug addict, so of course he doesn't trust women!  Doesn't sound like he's met one that is worth his time.  If a female came out with a song like this no one would blink an eye, but its true, women can be just as cruel as men.  I wish the best for him, hopefully someday he'll meet someone who really cares about him, so he wont have to put up anymore walls.

And this is the irony, he's refering to the bitches in the song as shallow people in the world. Read the song again, and you'll see it... I got a laugh out of the comments on here though, all the women saying they love him, et cetera. He's talking about you kind of people in the song... \n\r\nRegardless, though, I like the beat and the fact that Eminem is not reserved in his songs. Anyone's who's been with a shallow or slutty girl may not feel this passionate but they can definately relate to an extent.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\ni really can't understand why everyone can't lighten the hell up and laugh at this song, cause i think it's pretty funny. I am a female, but unlike many people who've already posted, listening to this song does not make me want to jump Eminem's bones, nor does it make me want to cause him bodily harm. how can you get pissed at him for speaking the truth? yeah there are women out there who are sluts and liars and only want to hook up with him because he's famous or rich or whatever. more power to him for calling them on it. does it make him sexist if its true????!!!!! Furthermore, the majority of the insults in the song are directed to the following types of women: Sluts, Hos, and Bitches.  I don't fall into any of those categories, so maybe that's why i don't take it so personally.\r\nalso, guys are liars and sluts too, we all know that. if a chick sang this song would you all be jumping on her calling her sexist?? probably not, but there's the double standard.\n\r\ntazzy:\r\n he said you want what you can't have, don't touch what you can't grab, end up with two back hands...\r\n*to back hand someone generally means to bitch slap them as far as i know, so he probably means you can't have me, don't touch me or you're gonna get smacked* \r\nthat's what i get out of it anyway.\n\r\nBlackberry: you are so right, i thought the same thing when i saw Kill Avrils name \n\r\ndesperacidea (sorry if i spelled that wrong) don't worry,:  i would run the other way as fast as i could. lol\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nVery easy...  The girl is too messed up in the head and looking for a guy she will never find.  He comes around and is the best thing she will ever get and she still acts like a dumb ho.  He finally realizes this and he tells her there is no chance he can be her superman (who is the stongest and best) Sorry Susie but it is the truth.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nA lot of things in this song are funny (yeah, the anthrax lyric is \"pure eminem\" as someone said), but it's also a very melancholy and touching song...\r\nThe thing I love about it (and about a lot of Eminem's music), is it isn't nearly so mindless as some of the rap you hear where they're just pure \"sex fuck bitch whores ima gangsta woo drugs\"\r\nThere are actual meanings and stories behind his lyrics, and real feelings, and the sounds within the songs give his music a huge touch of personality. (This is partially in response to the person who disagrees with this music btw) Even if some people might take the music \"seriously,\" it is unfortunately because they're too stupid to listen to it closely, and that is something that is unavoidable with any medium (and I don't think that a stable person will actually imitate what they hear in this music anyway). As far as bad treatment of women in his music, yes, it is unfortunate, but it isn't bad treatment of women, and a lot of his songs are really mocking more than anything. (And he does seem to love his daughter and care for her greatly, which implies that it is more that he's jaded, than that he's just inherently an asshole, especially what with bitterness at his mother and his wife, etc etc)\r\nAnyway, regarding this song specifically: it isn't just about hating on women, really. At least, I think it's more about encountering all these fake, whorish women (and perhaps he just attracts them, or it's partially because of his outlook, but nonetheless). It's basically the outpouring of a very very hurt individual who has put a barrier. The lyric \"maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll some day grow\" is very important in this, as well as the lyrics when the girls are talking about being unfazed, in which they're portrayed as trying to prove they can be trusted, even though they more likely just want to hump the guy (and again, vice versa ... eminem obviously feels the same way)\r\nIt's just a statement of his state of mind saying that relationship(s?) have fucked him over and he's just too sick of it to care anymore - for now.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nAck, sorry, putting another post.

I don't see why this song is funny, it's really dark IMO.

He is basically mocking people who got offended after his first 2 albums. It sounds super sweet at the beginning and as soon as you think he might actually be making some sort of love song, he's like \"Bitch you make me hurl.\" \n\r\nAlso, he is saying that a lot of (not all) women are fake, gold digging whores who act nice in your face and the next day, they are gone with your bank accounts cleaned out.

To me, this song is about how screwed up things are in the world (what I think the majority of his songs are about), particularly that have to do with relationships. He's not degrading women or anything like that, I think he's simply putting out to the world the things that are really messed up out there. Eminem is no idiot, he's not going to put such extreme ideas out there because he truly believes in them, he's doing it to reveal to everyone what he has only been \"lucky\" enough to experience. Also, his life definitely never was the bes and still isn't so he's got a lot of problems to rap about. And he came straight out of the gutter with nothing to build off of, so his idea, in my opinion, to get noticed has always been to put out the most attention-grabbing material. Maybe I'm just taking this all naively, but I think everyone should get off his back and at very least appreciate his originality.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_103": "\nThis song is about Jennifer Watkins, who wrote the tell-all book \"Cleaning Out My Closet.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_104": "\nhes making fun of superman, what he doesn't know is that he could be a good super hero to if he chooses to.  friend or foe?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_105": "\nhe was telling everyone hes not superman, \n he knew it was a guy in fort wayne Indiana, and hes been downing him his whole career, the moral of the story is, never bet against God, because superman is right here\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_106": "\nYes\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_107": "\nThis sums up his frustration With the women who just wanted to fuck Eminem talking game trying to play like it's love.\r\nHe was in love with two other women who constantly did the same exact type of thing to him as addicts, he can see through it.   it's actually sad to me that he can't trust anyone because anyone he really likes is behind a curtain and groupies are what gets behind his curtain everyday with the same story, the story portrayed here.

Whilst I don't completely agree that \"he's a bastard and should die\" or whatever, I do think that this song is quite offensive. From all the comments here you can tell that. Almost everyone is saying \"women are bitches\" \"don't do anything for them\" \"just get what you can then leave\" etc. This just proves that this song is creating a terrible perception of women and that his lyrics are quite sexist and they have a lot of influence. Also to wicked1, yes I would think this song were sexist if a woman were singing it.\n\r\nAnother point, any girl who says \"omg now i love enimen after hearing this song\" you either have not actually considered what this song is saying or have no self-respect. This song should not cause you to love him, that's just ridiculous. I agree with Desaparecida, if a guy says this is his \"themesong\" run as fast as you can.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_111": "\nhahah fuck ya bitches\r\nstop fucking wasting or times with ur high expectations and standards.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
