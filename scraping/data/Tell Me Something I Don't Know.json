{"comment_0": "\nno comments???\n\r\nwell, to me...I relate to this song, because it's like when someone tells you that you're not good enough or in this case \"you'll never do that\" or they don't support your dreams, and you're like \"ya know what, tell me somethin i don't know!\" and then when you finally prove them wrong, it's an amazing feeling!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nZacly!

She thinks before she acts and she is always fully clothed.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis song relates to me alot. I am a girl who loves to play football. Everyone thinks I shouldn't because I'm a girl who is sensative.Well to me,I can knock those boys down in seconds!LOL!Well thats y this song relates 2 me!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis song is defenitely about fullfilling your dreams, no matter what. And so what if you know the chance you\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00b4ll actually do it is not so big. Without dreams this world is nothing. That's what I keep saying to myself, anyway. \r\nAbout the disneypart; yes, she STARTED at disney. that doesn't mean she'll be staying there. Gomez took her shot and is now taking her talent to another level. Go and get 'em is what I'd say...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nThis song is nothing to me other than another Disney-fied pop piece. Now, there's a place and time for that.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nGood Charlotte covered this song!\r\nI think that's so cool lol [=\r\nAnd funny\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\ni dig it...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
