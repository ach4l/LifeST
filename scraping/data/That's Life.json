I used to think Frank was just for old, boring people, but that's so not true.

It is a happy song mixed with a bit of melancholy. It was my grandad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favourite song my mother tells me. Maybe it was him sending me a message to get through this empty nest syndrome as my last child moves off to University. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Life ! \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
