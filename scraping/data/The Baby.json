{"comment_0": "\nI love this song! It's so true about how a mother thinks of her children... My father is the youngest in his family and my grandma has alzheimer's disease, she doesn't remember a thing and has quite facinating hallucinations but that's beside the point. Yesterday during Christmas my dad was late because he had to work, but all my grandma would say was \"when's mitch getting here, he's coming right\"... But she didn't make mention about other members of the family not being there. Part of that is probably that he visits her house everyday to see how her and my grandpa are doing.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nWhen my grandmother on my dads side passed away this song came out around the same time. And i will always remember that because when my dad heard the news and left to Illinois from California to go see her. He was too late she was already in a coma and they to decide then what to do. \n\r\n\"I got a call in Alabama, said come on home to Louisiana\r\nAnd come as fast as you can fly.\r\n'Cause your momma really needs you, and says she's got to see you,\r\nShe might not make it through the night.\"\n\r\nThats exactly what happened.... it still makes me cry to this day to see the look on his face when this song comes on the radio.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
