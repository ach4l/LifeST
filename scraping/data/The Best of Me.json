At the beginning of the song he \"finds a box of memories\" which is easy he finds things in a box that remind him of his ex.  Once he starts remembering, the feelings start flooding in and he must start drinking to try and forget, but the thing is \"her memory is getting the best of him\" causing him to drink. Causing him to get angry \"punching the walls and carrying on like i've gone insane.\" \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
