This always reminds me of my schools football team. \r\nThe only thing is that i feel like this is something Brad Paisley would write and sing, not Kenny. But it still works :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nIt's \"Well it's turn and face the Stars and Stripes\"  I also think it's \"Kings of the school, man, WE'RE the Boys of Fall\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nHonestly, I love this song, especially with the video. I am in the marching band and us and the football team are brothers in arms at our second year high school. I am going to cry when this season ends.\n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI hate country, but, it's where I was raised, and this song... I'm never gonna have those days back\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
