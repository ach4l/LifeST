I've been listening to this song a lot likely and for me, it takes a more general perspective on everything I've seen. When I coupled the lyrics with the instruments, it came together for me.\n\nBorn to push you around\nYou better just stay down\nYou pull away\nHe hits the flesh\nYou hit the ground\nMouths so full of lies\nTend to black your eyes\nJust keep them closed\nKeep praying\nJust keep waiting\n\nThe idea of \"just stay[ing] down\" when in the eyes of some kind of adversity (someone \"born to push you around\") is of course suppose to be the opposing voice of the songs message. The person goes to hit the ground i.e. having some sort of struggle such as being bullied or maybe failing at what someone aspires to be great at. The \"mouth so full of lies\" could be akin to naysayers surrounding this individuals or even to those trying to console the person saying \"things will get better\" which tends to black your eyes because it doesn't get any better or because the negative things said only hurt you. Classically, this individual is weak and meager and just hopes whatever they are going through will end.\n\nWaiting for the one\nThe day that never comes\nWhen you stand up and feel the warmth\nbut the sunshine never comes\nNo the sunshine never comes\n\nThis individual sits around waiting for the day he will be free of whatever problems he has- the day that never comes, the sunshine that he won't feel because the sun won't come. \n\nPush you cross that line\nJust stay down this time\nHide in yourself\nCrawl in yourself\nYou'll have your time\nGod I'll make them pay\nTake it back one day\nI'll end this day\nI'll splatter color on this gray\n\nThis individual has been pushed by whatever problem he has so much that he crawls inside of himself and hides, hoping that one day he can make whoever caused the pain pay for what they did. But again, this is all \"wishful thinking\". He speaks in the future but it has never happened. We see that \"the day that never comes\"- the day of redemption- doesn't come because these individuals are sitting back and taking it and not standing up. In a way its about making that day come, not waiting for it.\n\nThe music goes from sad, depressed and painful to full of angst, passion and energy as the lyrics come to with \n\nLove is a four letter word\nAnd never spoken here\nLove is a four letter word\nHere in this prison\nI suffer this no longer\nI put it into\nThis I swear!\nThis I swear!\nThe sun will shine\nThis I swear!\n\nThere is no love because the problem has been overthrown by \"the prison\" (the problem entrapping the individual). He must deal with his problem head on, fully facing it and create his own sunshine because it won't simply come to him. And this individual swears he will break free from his problem and feel that sunshine.\n\nAfter this, the music becomes immensely powerful and full of passion, the same passion we see during the chorus, but that passion ends and becomes a sad melody again because the individual simply gave up and waited. Now, the power is in full force because the individual had sworn to make change and to take all of the empty promises they had made in the second verse and make them happy.\n\nI believe this song is about standing up and fighting, not sitting back and waiting for the good times to come. You have to make your good times and fight hard and energetically for them- The sun will shine, this I swear.\n\nThis song is so powerfully emotional and raw. The lyrics fit the music and the song is a masterpiece and my favorite of the whole album.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI believe this song is about the release of Tools next album!\n\r\nAs a tool fan you feel beaten and lied to with hope of a new album but the day never comes....\n\r\nMetallica like the rest of us just want to hear more Tool.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI don't know what it means, and i don't care.

Doesn't have to be a romantic relationship but a relation of any kind where someone is a bully, and the the hate the bullied starts to grow when he/she is oppressed and beaten. As the lyrics says the beaten never seem to be able to to reach out and feel the warmth of real love, the hate grows and he/she thinks of revenge but the day when it'll happen never comes, as most people in abusive relationships never does take  the stand, they just take the beating and hope it'll end (on the day that never comes).\n\r\nAnd now I understand what Hetfield meant when he said that he didn't want the song to be interpreted as being only about the Iraq war. As the video is made by a director who's interpretation is expressed in the video. \n\r\nI think the song is great, the lyrics can be interpreted in many ways as great lyrics should be. And Hetfield again proves his skills at writing great lyrics and great riffs. And of course the other guys did a great job on this.

There are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions, and people believe it's more valid because they're popular.

METALLICA IS REBORN!\n\r\nWhen you listen to it, you can hear Metallica's adaptation once more to the more current trends of music, only mixed with the classic metallica style. To me this sounds like The Black Album mixed with Load, and some new stuff thrown in.\n\r\nGreat job overall. Hetfields passion filled vocals (best of his career, even topping S&M). Rob Trujillo's awesome bass, Lars even stepped up his drumming game. The only person im somewhat dissapointed about is Kirk. The solo's were good, but not vintage Kirk (i'm talking the Kirk from Ride the Lightning). Great job though, I am DEFINITELY copping this one on the day it comes out.\n\r\nBut on to the real meaning, since this isnt songreviews.net. \n\r\nI think this is about resentment of ones life. Someone has been abused, or felt abuse in their life. OR, maybe just neglected and discouraged by someone. Whether it be a family member, friend, girlfriend, teacher, etc.\n\r\nHe is waiting for a day where he can show them wrong. That he is worthy of their praise. This is just my interpretation.

Well, either way, they're Metallica, and they have always rocked (except on St. Anger), and always will in my opinion.\n\r\nMy interpretation of this song's lyrics are of child abuse.  Since the child in the song keeps hoping to be saved from his abusive family, and that day never seems to come, and it just goes on and on.  \n\r\nThis song reminds of me of Dave Pelzer's autobiography, \"A Child Named It\".

This sound like a pretty good comeback to me ;)\n\r\nAnyway, the actual reason I posted.  Any ideas on the \"love is a four letter word\" bit?

If that's the case then don't like any band. They're all bound to change. The fickle masses will never be content with something they've heard repeatedly and will eventually cry out for change, but when that change comes they're unwilling to accept it... They shun it, shove it aside, and try to degrade it. St. Anger was an amazing album. It reinvented Metallica, while still bringing back the aggression of Kill 'Em All. This album, will no doubt be just as spectacular.\n\r\nOn to a meaning.\r\nTo me, this song is about abuse. Not just physical, \"He hits the flesh\", but mental, \"Push you cross that line\". The obvious physical abuse is there. But the mental is something I believe to be buried under the physical. This person is dying to be free, but it's a day that can't come. \"When you stand up and feel the warmth, but the sunshine never comes\" references the impossibility of leaving. Which is most likely where the director of the video pulled the war idea. As for \"Love is a four letter word\" it obviously falls under the mental, but is it about a relationship? You could say that. The person could be trapped in a loveless relationship and unable to leave because of the abuse. But, I think it's brainwashing due to the mental abuse and the insane mind has finally snapped and is unable to tell what is real and what has been forced into their head. The sun will always come, but this person can't see that. \"Love is a four letter word... Here in this prison.\" Seems to back up the whole brainwashing and conflicting opinions. \"Love is a four letter word, I'm confined, it means nothing.... But I can't fight this... It's too powerful.\" \n\r\nI realize this is really long, but this song just speaks to me.

(the ones who enslave people into this prison).  \"I'll end this day...\",  knowing that there is no \"one\" that will come to save the world, he takes responsibility of the issue, ending the days of waiting, giving color to everyones grey perception of life.  \n\r\n\"Love is a four letter word...\", love, in this prison, is used religiously by people.  in other words, love is not what is needed for the world to change.  understanding this, he does not \"suffer\" from this confusion any longer and again takes responsibility and \"swears\" by his own self that the world will change.\n\r\nsorry if this was too long but it is important that every verse is explained and not just some of the lyrics, like some people on here.  so this is not about a relationship, or a war with armies, or just a story.  all of james' songs have to do with life in general in which we can all relate to.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_65": "\ngreat song death magnetic sounds like the missing link between ...and justice for all and the black album\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_66": "\nThe way I initially interpreted it was for it to be between a person and a drug habit they can't kick. In this sense, it is about an abusive relationship, but it's a relationship between a person and their habit, not about a relationship between two people necessarily. \n\r\nThe way I would summarize the lyrics with this interpretation is as follows: the addiction pushes you around and makes you more and more reclusive. You lie to everyone around you and become hostile towards those who love you and end up crawling inside yourself amidst all the destruction the addiction is causing around you -- it's the only place you feel safe and sane, is in your own head in your own world and you're basically imprisoned there. You keep hoping for the day that you will be free of the imprisonment of addiction and feel the warmth of redemption (the sun shining on you), but it's ultimately a day that never comes.\n\r\nThat's just my 2 cents on the song.

Most of them are true, of course, since you can interpret the lyrics of a song in many different ways.\r\nI like to combine all these interpretations.  I think that the song is about fighters. Fighters in war, fighters in relationships, fighters in sports and fighters in real life. I really don't see the aggressive people in these lyrics, I would even say that the song is about people who are way too less aggressive or hold their aggression back. About people who were \"born to be pushed around\" and to \"stay down\".  Whatever the reason for this behavior may be, those people either think that they are not able to fight or they don't want to fight even if it's necessary. Whatever reason, maybe because they were raised by their parents to believe that aggression is not a solution.\r\nThe lyrics describe the way of dealing with such situations that require more responsibility, more reaction, more aggression and less waiting for better days. \"The day will never come\" if you don't put up with the things in your way.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009eMouth so full of lies\r\nTender black, your eyes\r\nJust keep them closed\r\nKeep praying\r\nJust keep waiting\u00e2\u0080\u009c\r\nDescribes the first reaction to circumstances that require responsibility. If people are not able to take this responsibility, they tend to look away, dream of better days and wait for them to come true. But, as the chorus tells us, \u00e2\u0080\u009ethe sunshine never comes\u00e2\u0080\u009c.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ePush you cross that line\r\nJust stay down this time\r\nHide in yourself\r\nCrawl in yourself,\r\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have your time\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009c\r\nEven if those people are pushed across that line, they still feel the force to hold themselves down. They hide in themselves, but they start to think of a fight: \u00e2\u0080\u009eMy time will come\u00e2\u0080\u009c. The first thoughts of taking action.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009eI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll splatter color in this gray\u00e2\u0080\u009c\r\nIn this part of the process, people start to believe in justice.

Watching all the unjust things that happen to you or others, you stop to believe in love. In the video, this meaning is shown very clearly. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the scene where the soldier loads his gun, gets on the military vehicle and starts his own fight against the war. When the lyrics end in this song, the video even continues the plot. We see the soldier getting into a dangerous situation. Saying, when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in your fight, don\u00e2\u0080\u0098t trust people implicitly.\r\nThe message of this great song to me:\r\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be sorry for yourself or the things that happen to others. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way life goes. The only thing you can do is to take responsibility, stand up for yourself and others, and fight. For me, the song is a motivation to stop dreaming, worrying or waiting and get up and contribute my share to more justice in this world.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_80": "\ni think that james is speaking to robert trujillo that his armpits smells really good.

IN A NON-BULLSHIT CHRISTIAN CATHOLIC WAY!!!!*******\n\r\nFirst let me start by saying THANK GOD Metallica created a few songs that were deep but still simple. I loved Saint Anger, But nothing like I loved THIS album just like the REST of the old Metallica Albums.\n\r\nWhat I mean by Deep but still simple is that, Well, after a song converts you, you tend to show it to other people to show it's effects. Every person i showed it to had a COMPLETELY different interpretation of what the lyrics ment, but at the same time, was touched just as much. Writing a song, that can apply to just about everyone, and remain deep to those who listen to it, THAT is a TRUE masterpiece.\n\r\nTIME for LYRICAL Interpretation!!!!\r\nThis is what it ment to me. As crazy as I feel i sound when i make myself read it now.................\n\r\nBorn to push you around\r\nbetter just stay down\r\nyou pull away\r\nhe hits the flesh\r\nyou hit the ground\n\r\nThis doesn't show much for how I interpret the lyrics actually. Maybe other then how I feel. Hurt, in a \"can't win\" situation.\n\r\nmouth so full of lies\r\ntender black, your eyes\r\njust keep them closed\r\nkeep praying\r\njust keep waiting\n\r\nThis is how I see society with things that walk a moral fine line. How do you know what is truly right or wrong? you can't tell, because the way that society sees it, hinders your view, and BLACKS your eyes.\r\nThe rest says that there's no point in trying to fight or struggle to figure out what society / god? would really consider right or wrong and to just keep praying and waiting......\n\r\nwaiting for the one\r\nthe day that never comes\r\nwhen you stand up and feel the warmth\r\nbut the sunshine never comes, no\r\nno, the sunshine never comes\n\r\nThis explains exactly how I felt. Literally.\r\nIt's Like I was waiting for god to come down and tell me the answers because no one else would tell me the truth of what was truly right or wrong.\n\r\n*When you stand up and feel the warmth*\r\n*but the sunshine never comes, no*\r\n*no, the sunshine never comes*\n\r\nPretty much exactly what it says. Like it's saying \"when \"he\" comes down and tells you the truth, your answers, all the questions you've been seeking, but.. \"he\" never comes\"... Like they're saying.. It's hopeless. It's too late. maybe we'll never know. I've also found several references to \"sunshine\" and connected them to another song by Metallica called, \"The Unforgiven II\". This makes me feel very much as if, maybe we're already in the apocalypse. Maybe evil won, and it's too late. So it made me ask myself what did \"god\" want then. what could I do. And the answer which I felt was correct was that I'd have to lead by example and nothing more. I would have to be the \"Christian/Catholic\" \"he\" wanted me to be. I'd have to undo Years of damage by the Christian/Catholic church. I know TOO many people who \"are\" their Religion, but they don't practice they're religion. And hey, to each they're own, but there's a reason why such a HIGH amount of people have strayed from their faiths. Primarily, the attitude of the church, which i don't agree with half the time, the fact that some church groups will force quotes from the bible on you to try to sway what you do, or how you think. And it just gets increasingly more judgmental and aggravating. Do Not Judge. ITS RIGHT UP there with do not Kill/Steal/Cheat. If people were just left alone to figure out their own PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP with \"god\", everything would be fine. Instead people are forced, judged, directed too harshly, etc. All I can do is admit that I am what I am, show it's OKAY to be what I am, and show it's okay to have a relationship with god, even after previous mess ups, and hopefully people will see my convictions, that i am what i am and HOPEFULLY (this is all I really want) reconsider their own personal relationship with god/jesus/whatever saint you feel closest to. and when the time is right, things will work themselves out and things will be good. just keep that door in your heart open.\n\n\r\n****************LYRICS CONTINUED****************\n\r\n***push you cross that line***\r\n***just stay down this time***\r\n***hide in yourself***\r\n***crawl in yourself***\r\n***you'll have your time***\n\r\nSame as the first set of lyrics. just set the mood for how you physically feel? \n\r\n***God I'll make them pay***\r\n***take YA** back one day***\r\n***I'll end this day***\r\n***I'll splatter color on this gray***\n\r\nThis is AGAIN exactly how i felt. \r\nI was so upset. I was literally crying to myself thinking about God. How I felt like he just wanted to love with open arms. How everything should be unconditional. But i denied him for so long, and that society couldn't see the truth. how so many people hate religion based on what they've seen from others and how they practiced it. How many people reject god/jesus/whom'ever, because of how an entire group/society treated them. And all god wants to do is offer salvation. Love. Open Arms. But you need to open your arms as well to receive him. As gappingly homosexual as this all sounds to the majority of you, i broke down.\r\nTake ya* back one day can mean a lot of things.You could just be saying. just give me time. but hell .it's pretty generic.\r\n***I'll end this day***\r\n***I'll spatter Color On This Gray***\n\r\nExactly how i Felt AGAIN. It was like after realizing how my religion was, and how other people were directly effected by it, especially all the while it was like, \"he\" just wanted to give love and be there for anyone who wanted to come, It's like me making a vow. That I'll end this misconception. I'll fix the problem by showing the truth. I'll spatter color on this gray. People WILL see the truth. And that's all I could DO for \"him\".\n\r\n***love is a four letter word***\r\n***and never spoken in **HERE***\r\n***love is a four letter word***\r\n***here in this prison***\n\r\nPretty simple. take it for what it is / for what you want. Love's not felt in this prison. Prison of lies and misconception and lack of truth. \n\r\n***I suffer this no longer***\r\n***I'LL PUT AN END TO*****\r\n***this I swear***\r\n***this I swear***\r\n***the sun will shine***\r\n***this I swear***\r\n***this I swear***\r\n***this I swear***\n\r\nHim Swearing that he'll put an end to the lack of unrebuttaled love. Wanting to fix everything, swearing that The sun WILL shine. That the truth will be seen, that god's still here.\n\n\n\n\n\r\nOK. Now that was extremely RELIGIOUSLY based. Perhaps no one else will see it the way i did, like i said, i showed it to quite a few people, and every person came to their own relization and conection on how it exaplained their life. FROM A ATHEIST - CHRISTIAN ALLLLLL THE WAY TO AN ANAREXIC EXPLAINING HER SITUATION AND HOPING FOR RECOVERY! really... i swear that was one person's interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nEither way, this song rocks. \n\r\nSorry to include so much religion.

One very familiar from a abusive relationship.  I agree this isn't there best musical composition, or lyrics. The combined emotion created by the two is what makes the song real. \n\r\nI agree it is about a abusive relationship, but more accurately I think it is about a abusive father-son relationship.  \n\r\nIt captures that rage of an abusive father-son relationship.  You are powerless to stop it, so you develop a deep rage.  You allow yourself to be put into submission because that is the only thing that makes it stop, and your hatred is the only thing that can't be taken away. \n\r\nWith this interpretation the lyrics make perfect sense to me. Having to fit it to music can distort the strict interpretation of lyrics. In that there I can see two lines that are iffy:\n\r\n\"God I'll make them pay\"\r\nThem isn't singular, so perhaps his mother was in on it to?\n\r\n\"Born to push you around\"\r\nWhile your father may be abusive he isn't necessarily born to abuse.

This is when the person being abused has something that pushes him to a point where he gives up, He literally has reached a point where he will no longer try, fuck the world cannot begin to describe what this person feels. Since he cannot be a good person and he cannot find any peace inside himself. He gives in to his hate, he closes his eyes, and the only two things that remain inside himself are revenge and pain. He makes a promise with himself, so absolute that even if he wants to he will not be able to break this pact. He has sold his soul, and it will never come back, The title of this song is also rather amazing. It is called \"The Day that Never Comes\" because even though you are now a husk of a person, and are dead inside, probably forever. That pact that you made with yourself to BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY no matter the workload or task before you. is void because there is absolutely no way you will get revenge on the entire human race. It is a physically impossible task and even though the promise stays strong inside you. The best way to explain it would be that the world get in the way of your ambition of revenge. That is why the song is called the day that never comes. \n\r\nThis song.... is the abyss of the human spirit, this is basically the outcome of abuse. Bullying, probably domestic violence, among other things. Metallica IS THE BEST. anyone who says otherwise is literally shallow and they don't even know it.\n\r\nThis is why you don't bully people and this song is why people bring guns to school, WATCH WHAT YOU F**CKING say because you don't know who you are pissing on.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_121": "\nI think it's about bullying(but my interpretation on bullying is close to war)\n\r\nBorn to push you around - The bully is born to push you around\r\nYou better just stay down - Or else he'll hit you again\r\nYou pull away - You try to run or you refuse to fight\r\nHe hits the flesh - He still hits you\r\nYou hit the ground - you fall down\r\nMouths so full of lies - People call you a loser\r\nTend to black your eyes - You start to believe them\r\nJust keep them closed - Keep your eyes closed to stop believing in their lies\r\nKeep praying\r\nJust keep waiting\n\r\nWaiting for the one\r\nThe day that never comes - The day when the bullying stops\r\nWhen you stand up and feel the warmth - The warmth of love from other people\r\nbut the sonshine never comes - the son is not exceptional and will never break free. He will never shine.\r\nNo the sonshine never comes\n\r\nPush you cross that line - It's the last straw\r\nJust stay down this time - You are begging yourself not to fight them\r\nHide in yourself - Don't show your feelings\r\nCrawl in yourself - Live inside yourself\r\nYou'll have your time - Your revenge\r\nGod I'll make them pay\r\nTake it back one day - \r\nI'll end this day - I'll end this bullying once and for all and start a fresh new day\r\nI'll splatter color on this gray - Splatter is defined in oxford dictionary as:\r\n\"splash with a liquid, typically a thick or viscous one\" A thick liqued would be blood on his gray life.\n\r\nWaiting for the one\r\nThe day that never comes\r\nWhen you stand up and feel the warmth\r\nbut the sonshine never comes\r\nNo the sonshine never comes\n\r\nLove is a four letter word\r\nAnd never spoken here - I feel no love and I am not sure it exsists \r\nLove is a four letter word\r\nHere in this prison - In this awfull place love is only a four letter word and not a feeling\r\nI suffer this no longer - I will stand this any longer\r\nI put it into - I put all of my hatred into these words\r\nThis I swear!\r\nThis I swear!\r\nThe son will shine - I swear that I will shine!!! I will break free.\r\nThis I swear!\r\nThis I swear!\r\nThis I swear!\n\r\nAnd then comes the instrumental part which in my ears sound a lot like a school shooting. Metallica has used guitars to simulate machine guns before(disposable heroes) and the fast riffs do sound like a machine gun.\r\nHe knows that school shootings is not an option for him because to him it's madness but in the end he has been pushed so hard that he has become insane and is laughing as he shots his fellow students(The laughing being the higher pitched fast riffs together with the sound of the gun, while the low is just the gun). \r\nThis is just my interpretation.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_122": "\nIt's about a soldier who loses his friend to an I.E.D. and is angered at the Muslim people but learns to forgive them.

I agree, I think the song is about abuse, but not as a broad statement. \n\nJames and Jason did not have a good relationship. James could never get over the loss of Cliff and he took it out on Jason. While the other members learned to accept Jason as a full member of Metallica, James never could and subsequently, did not let Jason contribute very much artistically to Metallica. James continued his stranglehold on Jason when he told him he could not go do his side project. Jason drew the line there and quit Metallica. \n\nThe downward spiral of Metallica ensued resulting with James in rehab for alcohol. It took getting sober for James to realize what a control freak he was being and why he was being that way. James' admissions start to come out lyrically with All Within My Hands from St Anger...\n\n\"Love is control. I'll die if I let go.\"\n\nThe Day That Never Comes is a further explanation of that line, why it is important and what it means. The lyrics don't really expose the true meaning of the song until the second verse...\n\n\"Push you cross that line\nJust stay down this time\nHide in yourself\nCrawl in yourself\nYou'll have your time\"\n\nThis is James controlling Jason's contributions while attempting to comfort him with the notion that this is your one and only family and one day, you will shine. James continues to explain his behavior with this...\n\n\"Love is a four letter word\nAnd never spoken here\nLove is a four letter word\nHere in this prison\"\n\nThis ties back to the \"Love is control\" line from All Within My Hands. Love did not mean \"love\" in the general sense to James. Love meant control; control meant love. James did not want Jason to do his side project because he did not want Jason to \"like\" that better and leave Metallica. \n\nHowever, this control over Jason is what ultimately lead to his departure. Jason was never allowed to make the contributions to Metallica that he wanted to, nor was he ever truly accepted by James as a full member of Metallica. That is The Day That Never Comes.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_124": "\nI believe that this song and video are about the choices and decisions that soldiers have to make under pressure. Metallica shows us that a hardened soldier can still have a soft side to them.\n\n\nWhen his friend is shot, he feels sad or hurt or like the love has been \n\nbroken. As the lyrics state \u00e2\u0080\u0098love is a four letter word, and never spoken here\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nwhich means that love is like a swear word on the battlefield. Like anyone, the soldier is upset when his friend is shot.He channels his anger to go and fight for justice.\n\n\nWhen the team spotted the Arab couple they were on to it straight away as they were tense and uneasy. The soldier was primed and ready to shoot but then he remembered his friend and made the decision to cease fire and break the cycle. Otherwise everyone ends up killing each other.\n\nI think Metallica wrote this song to show people how the soldiers are actually all good. They are not stereotypical war machines.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_125": "\nTo me this song is about a guy who likes this girl that is in an abusive relationship. The guy is saying \"the day that never comes\" is when the girl will realize that the she doesn't belong in that abusive relation ship. When it is said \"love is a four letter word never spoken here\" the narrator loves this girl but she doesn't love him at all. When the narrator says \" I suffer this no longer\" and \"the sun will shine\" I think he is saying he moved on because he knows he will never have a shot with that girl.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_126": "\nNot only their best song in my opinion but delivers a strong message along with it.

Growing up, I was bullied and beaten by my dad. I once tried to enlist in the marines and he saw the paper in the mail. Said I was too stupid and weak to make it and continued to beat me. When I heard this song, it hit me like a brick. Love this.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_130": "\nMost of you got a decent intuition imagining that it is about an abusive relationship.  I probably would as well if I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t luckily found out long ago that every instance of sun in the lyrics is spelled son.  After finding this out I did research and my new feelings about the song were close to what I newly imagined.  Anyway, the song is essentially about a child growing up in a loveless, occasionally abusive family with unfeeling parents.  Specifically it is about Hetfield\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own upbringing.  So sorry it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t about relationships at its heart.  But hey, music can be what you want it to be and honestly the relationship angle works so go with it if you like.  Either way pretty good song man.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_131": "\nGreat song. Metallica are back!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
