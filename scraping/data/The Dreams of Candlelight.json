{"comment_0": "\nThis song is supposedly based on Beethoveen's short relationship with his one true love. The meaning is pretty obvious: she's telling him to forget about his worries for now and just spend the night with her.\n\r\nVery beautifully written and performed, in my opinion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
