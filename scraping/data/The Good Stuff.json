It's a song that every generation can appreciate.

A celebration of the moments that add up to a good life with your life partner, and how even things that seem trying at the time can become precious with time.  Plus *news flash* trying to drown your sorrows or frustrations with booze isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the way to a good life.  The passage of wisdom from an older, wiser man to a less- experienced young one is a great theme, too.  This song makes me misty-eyed (and choked up) whenever I hear it.\n\r\nI also think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit of a magical angle; the bartender seems to know exactly why the young man is there even though there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no indication they know each other, they have the bar completely to themselves for quite a while, and the young man felt somewhat compelled to go there.  The bartender seemed like a spiritual guide to help the younger man choose a path that will prove very fulfilling.  Perhaps he is a spirit; \u00e2\u0080\u009csoul\u00e2\u0080\u009d is used, rather than \u00e2\u0080\u009cperson\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or some such. \n\r\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another mark of a good song, too; giving you more to think about!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_28": "\nGreat song to put things into perspective. The \"good stuff\" is also the most important stuff in life. Sometimes it's all too easy to take for granted or want more or be dissatisfied, but in the end, these are the moments! So, drink it up! Perfect song to play on your anniversary to remind you...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
