{"comment_0": "\nJust like schism86 said, i had this post before the site re-vamped...  I'm just gonna copy what I wrote before.. It's hella long, so only read it if your REALLY interested.\n\r\nFirst off, sorry this is gonna be so long, I'm gonna disect pretty much every line\r\nWell guys, I'm not here to clear anything up on the meaning of this song, cuz I don't know it for sure.  I like to think my interpretation is right (some of you are probably closer though), but it's open to everyone's views, and I love reading what all of you think.  But anyway, here goes.\n\r\nI think unlike most songs, Tool is pretty straightforward on this song.  It doesn't seem allegorical, but it is quite deep.   To be honest, after buying lateralus and hearing this song, it became my life motto.  I hate grudges, and I can't stand holding them now.  It just seems so childish.  \n\r\nI think Maynard is almost throwing the idea of grudge holding back into the faces of people that do it.  He's making fun of them for such a savage thing.  Like the first line... \n\r\n\"wear the grudge like a crown of negativity\" (go ahead, put your grudge out where everyone can see it, let everyone know that you're mad and that you want to be that way).\n\r\n\"calculate what we will and will not tolerate\" (decide exactly what you want to get mad over that would make you hold a grudge. this way when it happens, you can keep putting that crown back on)\n\r\n\"desperate to control all and everything\" (you don't want to be on good terms.  you WANT the grudge.  if you can control the grudge, you can control the person you hold the grudge against.)\n\r\n\"unable to forgive your scarlet letterman\" (although they know they've done wrong, you won't forgive them under any circumstance)\n\r\n\"clutch it like a cornerstone, otherwise it all comes down\" (clutch the grudge that you hold like a cornerstone, because you know if you don't then the grudge dies. you don't want that)\n\r\n\"justify denials and grip em to the lonesome end\" (come up with excuses to continue holding the grudge, and stand by them until the end, even when everyone hates you for what you're doing, hence lonesome)\n\r\n\"Terrified of being wrong, ultimatum prison cell\" (you're scared to death that someone can prove that you have no reason to hold a grudge.  you worry about it so much you put yourself in your own little prison over it)\r\n[Remember this whole time, I believe Maynard's making fun of the people that do this.  Almost reverse psycology by showing them how stupid it is]\n\r\nThen I have to agree with 'Insecure Dilusions' idea on the Saturn thing.  Saturn was god of all greek gods.  he was sooo worried he could be overthrown he ate his children.  Yet Zeus was the one thing that Saturn overlooked.  That one thing overthrew Saturn and killed him.  Hang on to the grudge like saturn would, because if you don't you'll be humbled in your ignorance.  And later he says \"ignorant to the damage done\"... ignorance isn't stupidity, it's not knowing about something.  in this case, Saturn was ignorant to the damage done to himself until Zeus killed him.\n\r\n\"unable to forgive and we're sinking deeper\" (you won't forgive, and for this you're slowly creating a larger grudge)\n\r\nThe grudge begins to define you, confine you, even control you.\n\r\nAgain to the Saturn reference for almost the rest of the song.  Saying that Saturn, almost as if, takes over your body.  He and you become one, you make the decisions Saturn chose.  And not until you end the grudge will he quit tearing you apart.\n\r\nFinally Maynard quit's criticizing and simply tells them what they need to do.\r\nGive away the (corner)stone.  Let the oceans take and transmute this cold and weighted anchor (that was your grudge, holding you down).  Give away the stone.  Let the waters take and transmute these leaden (heavy burdensome) grudges into gold.  LET GO.\n\r\nAnd thus ends my entirely too long interpretation.  However, this is what I believe and exactly how I feel.  This pretty much explains my life motto.  I thank each of your for your time in reading such a long and drawn out post.  You deserve a pat on the back for putting up with my jabbering.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nSorry for the length of this.  It's a paper I wrote in school about the grudge.  Let me know what you guys think.\n\n\r\n    Letting go is the sometimes the hardest thing to do in life.  Moving on is hard whether we are facing a death or holding a grudge.  Both circumstances take an emotional toll, but they can be amplified by an unwillingness to let the past rest.  Perhaps the hardest part about situations like these is that the longer we hold on to the past, the stronger its grip is on our lives.  The Grudge, by Tool, is the first song from their album, Lateralus.  Simply defined, a grudge is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeeling of deep-seated resentment or ill will\u00e2\u0080\u009d. A grudge is more than a surface unwillingness; a grudge takes on a personality, it grows in strength, and it eventually controls our life.  Destruction is the only outcome for someone who cannot escape the deadly grip of a grudge \u00e2\u0080\u0094 he has to let go.  \r\n\tIn the first line, Maynard James Keenan, Tool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lead singer, describes the grudge as a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrown of negativity\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Crowns are usually seen as something glorious, brilliant, and beautiful; Keenan takes this symbol of power and authority and twists it into something dark and terrifying, but the idea of power is retained.  He is almost saying we are imbued with some sort of negative power when we allow this grudge to define us.  He goes on to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalculate what we will or will not tolerate/ Desperate to control all and everything\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  With this false sense of power created by a grudge, the person becomes filled with a sense of being able to control everything around them.  Typically, with the presence of a grudge comes a plan for revenge.  A person wearing this crown of negativity is oftentimes so blinded by it they are unable see the limits of their power.  \r\nI believe the next line, \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnable to forgive your scarlet lettermen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is an allusion to Nathaniel Hawthorne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Scarlet Letter.  The antagonist in this book, Roger Chillingworth, is seeking revenge on his ex-wife.  He believes that she has committed an act of adultery against him.  His quest for revenge consumes him so much that it affects his external appearance.  His ex-wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, dies before Chillingworth is able to exact his revenge.  Chillingworth soon follows him.  His life had become so intertwined with his grudge that they were interdependent.  When the source of power, the target, of his grudge was gone, the life drained out of him.  He died with nothing.  Just like Keenan said in his song, \u00e2\u0080\u009cClutch it like a cornerstone/otherwise it all comes down/justify denials and grip it to the lonesome end\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  A cornerstone is the source of stability for any building.  It needs to be solid and immovable.  Similarly, a grudge provides stability for a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, no matter how false that stability is.  Friends around us may point out how silly we are, but the holder is blinded by power.  Part of us is, \u00e2\u0080\u009cterrified of being wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Keenan says.  In the eyes of the holder, if he is found to be wrong, he will be put in an \u00e2\u0080\u009dultimatum prison cell\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  \r\n\tIf the song ended here, we would be without hope \u00e2\u0080\u0094 locked away in a prison cell, left to our own devices.  But Keenan tells us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaturn ascends/choose one or ten/hang on or be humbled again\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  The reference to Saturn ascending is an astrological idea of changes in life associated with the completion of a revolution by Saturn around the earth.  At this time in life, a choice has to be made.  When he says \u00e2\u0080\u009cone or ten,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I believe he uses this to express to polar opposites.  There is no middle ground; either the grudge is given up or held on to for another period of life.  The one glimmer of hope here is the presence of a choice.  Despite all of the power the grudge has, we can still choose to cast it away.  \r\n\tEven though Keenan provides a way for escape, he does not want us to become complacent; he reminds us of the only outcome if we choose to hang on to the grudge.  If we are \u00e2\u0080\u009cwear[ing] the grudge like a crown/desperate to control/unable to forgive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d then we will be \u00e2\u0080\u009csinking deeper\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  This begs the question, deeper into what?  I believe when a grudge comes to be, it is born out of reason.  We were wronged in some way, but as a grudge lingers in our mind it begins to create a false reality.  The truth we see with our eyes becomes distorted when it passes through the filter of the grudge.  The grudge becomes \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefining, confining, [and] controlling\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Our real self is buried away within our subconscious; seemingly powerless to regain control.  So we continue downward.  \r\n\tThen \u00e2\u0080\u009cSaturn comes back around to show you everything\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Now is the time to make a choice.  This stanza is the first time in the song that Keenan refers to the grudge as a stone.  He says, \u00e2\u0080\u009c[the grudge] drags you down like a stone\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  The other option is to be treated like \u00e2\u0080\u009ca child, light and innocent\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  The process of separating ourselves from the grudge is not easy.  We have to completely humble ourselves to the level of a child.  He is saying there must be a return to innocence; all of the unnecessary weight in life must be eradicated.  All the \u00e2\u0080\u009c[calculations of] what we will or will not tolerate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009c[desperations] to control all and everything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d serve only to complicate and fill our life with meaningless pursuits that waste any chance we have of living.  We must be like a child because only a renaissance of innocence will bring freedom from this \u00e2\u0080\u009ccold and fated anchor\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  \r\n\tFinally, Keenan begs us to \u00e2\u0080\u009cgive away the stone/let the oceans take and transmutate this cold and fated anchor/give away the stone/let the waters kiss and transmutate these leaden grudges into gold\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  His imagery of the oceans and waters is an allusion to baptism.  A thorough cleansing is necessary for change, but with change comes reward.  If this trial in life is endured, then \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese leaden grudges will be turned into gold\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Perseverance breeds greatness. \r\n\tKeenan breaks down in the end of the song.  He lets out a passionate scream \u00e2\u0080\u0094 I envision him falling to his knees with his hands on his head.  He knows he must let go, has to let go.  He begins whispering \u00e2\u0080\u009c[l]et go, let go, let go\u00e2\u0080\u00a6,\u00e2\u0080\u009d over and over, almost chanting it.  The song crescendos as he chants louder and louder until he is screaming \u00e2\u0080\u009clet go!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He knows where the grudge is taking him; he sees the destruction waiting for him if he cannot let go.  Change is never easy, but he has to try.  \r\n\tA grudge begins in reason but transforms into a powerful entity capable of destroying lives.  The only way to escape the endless spiral of increasing desperation to control everything around us is to choose to change.  No matter how attractive the crown is, we need to take it off.  Maynard James Keenan begs us to throw away \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis cold and fated anchor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but no one can make us let go, it must come from within.  In the end, it is up to us\u00e2\u0080\u00a6it always has been.     \n\n\n", "comment_2": "\nMaynard once said he used his music to get out frustrations he had of his past, and this I believe is him letting his past go. About his Family life, his look on other people, and even God. He really sees his life of anger leading him no where. Tool's earlier records showed Maynard's and the bend's anger and frustrations to the point where they were called an anti religious band by many. (In ways they were) Well Lateralus came and showed us a new side. \n\nMaynard sees the problem of hate and grudges, and the \"Prison cell\" it puts you in. As Saturn comes back around to show him everything, he sees it will consume him and spit him out until he chooses to let it go. \n\nThe ending is so powerful. I just picture Maynard thinking of all the things he's mad about, and not just letting them go, but literally changing his mind set as he screams his heart out. \"Turn these leaden grudges into gold\". This song is an utter masterpiece. Plugged in online didn't give this album enough credit, cause I see more Christian lyrics in this song alone than I do in some songs on Christian Radio. Funny actually. (My opinion though)\n\n-Zach\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nPeople use grudges as a means of control and supremacy, to make other people feel lesser. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about how letting go of past indiscretions and moving on will lead you to absolution, but allowing yourself to feel guilt because of someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resentment of your actions will only tie you down. Resentment is futile. but that's just what i get from the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nHere is my interpretation of 'The Grudge' \n\r\n\"Crown of negativity\" \r\nThe first thing that pops into my head is Jesus' crown of thorns, a burden. The crown is thereby also a symbol of religion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but this is a negative symbol. Because these days Christianity is a controlling power, which has decided for us what we will and will not tolerate. But the crown of negativity represents the reduction of our thinking IN GENERAL. We carry the crown on our heads, the highest place of our body, and it overshadows everything else. \r\n\"Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen\" \r\n\"The scarlet letter\" is a book by Nathaniel Hawthorne in which a woman who has committed adultery forced to wear a crimson 'A' on her chest for the crime. We stamp other people, judging them and refuse to forgive them. \r\nThis hatred of a foreign party - another person, another religion, another culture - most people have to maintain. Many people clutch their grudge as if it were a cornerstone, everything their unity (if is a group of people) is build on. But it may also be that the individual clings to this feeling to keep himself/herself together. In such cases we always try to justify denials. We cultivate our hatred and dare not to let it go, because we are afraid to make mistakes. So we put ourselves in a prison cell of ultimatum. \n\r\nThe most interesting part of the song deals with Saturn. After a little research has been up to me that everything in the song forms a synthesis. First, it takes Saturn about 29 years to go round the sun. 29 years symbolizes a mid-term crisis, a split. \r\n\"Choose one or ten\" \r\nThis refers to the zodiac in astrology, Aries is the number one and Capricorn is number ten. So the choice is between Capricorn and Aries. \r\nCapricorn is ruled by Saturn (Saturn is the creator of civilization and the social order, representing authority). Capricorn is stubborn, cautious and disciplined. \r\nAries is ruled by Mars (Mars usually associated with strength, spontaneity and energy). \r\nAries is bold and impulsive. In many ways it is the complete contrast to Capricorn. You could say that Aries is the Zodiac pioneer. By the way \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Maynard a Ram himself. \r\n\"Hang on or be humbled again\" \r\nBy choosing Capricorn you will again submit to the Authority and thus be humiliated, bow to other powers. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue living with this ugly feeling, unaware of how much damage we have caused to the outside world and ourselves. The grudge will narrow thinking further define and say that things can only be one way. \n\r\n\"Saturn comes back around to show you everything \r\nLet's you choose what you will, will not see and then \r\nDrags you down like a stone or lifts you up again \r\nSpits you out like a child, light and innocent \" \n\r\nThis refers to the myth of the Greek god Cronos (which the Romans later called Saturn) who ate his sons, so they would not kill him. Rhea (Cronos' wife) gave birth to another son, Zeus, and she gives her husband a stone instead of the child, and Cronos swallows the stone, believing it is his son. Later Zeus kills his father and sets his siblings free. The song raises the question: Will go down like a stone \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just like all the others ones \u00e2\u0080\u0093, or you will be like Zeus (Aries), escaping it all?\n\r\n\"Let the waters kiss and transmutate these leader grudges into gold\" \r\nIf we look at everything in an alchemical way, the solid substance, which is associated with Saturn, is lead. Lead represents decay and death. When Saturn ascends, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the choice between remaining the way you are and fall into decay, or to let go of a part of yourself (death, in a way) and thereby transform lead to gold - dissolve \"the cold and fated anchor.\" \n\r\nJust try to imagine all the energy we would have, if we did not spend so much time on bearing grudges.\n\r\nLike so many of Tools songs, this song is a metaphor for personal development.\n\n\n", "comment_5": "\ni think this song is pretty straight forward.  Grudge, holding onto it, gives you a sense of worth, knowing whats wrong, who to blame. But it also holds you down, not letting you overcome what happened.  Its refered to as a prison cell, confining you. You can hang on to it, or let it go and be humble.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nI think \"one or ten\" means \"all or nothing\". In other words, \"no compromise\", \"my way or the highway\", etc.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nThe 'Saturn comes back around' and 'Saturn ascends' lines makes me think of the No Doubt album 'The Return of Saturn'.\n\nSeems like an astrology reference to me.

I feel as if I am completing treason by literally translating it for you but afterall, this song is the holy gift in every sense of the term. Tool is heavily aligned with the esoteric and masonic occult symbology. Many people fail to make the parallels between these truths and our advanced ancient civilizations. The scarlett letterman are in fact alien beings who are in contact with many people on this earth. They created the human race and have directed our progress over many thousands of years. Saturn signifys destruction and mortality. The ancients were not savages like we were told, in fact they were far from it. The earth is surrounded by a false ascension matrix, it is a prison planet. It is more like a zoo than anything. When humans reach a certain technological peak we are wiped from the globe again by great flood and catastrophe. The only truth left is inscribed in the only thing that survives, stone. The grudge is the enlightened humans who are fully aware of this profound truth that resent their creators for placing them in a kind of matrix or prison. We have reached this technological point many times already, only to succumb to greed and depravity. Afterall, many different alien beings have attempted to have a hand in the path humanity decides to take. Transcending this barrier or obstruction and breaking free is knowing forgiveness and reaching true polarity of the soul. Ultimately, it was what we refuse to see that will decide our fate [or anchor]. We can walk with the Gods in eternity or we can be doomed over and over again. Spit back out like an innocent child with no recollection whatsoever. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nAs for the mythological aspect, I really think it has af few key verses about Saturn, (Greek Cronos.) In the Cosmogony (Creation of existance,) there is a constant war of succession; It starts with Ouranos, who, to avoid being succeeded by his children, prevents their physical birth from Gaea by entraping them in her womb. A beautiful scene progresses where Cronos (Saturn) sits in the womb with an adamantine sickle, given by Gaea, poised to cut off his dad's wang when he gomes to fornicate with Gaea. Well, he does just that, and the children, the Titans, escape and Cronos takes over as the prime deity. \n\r\nThe counter-succession continues when Cronos has children, but instead of trapping them inside like his father did him, he takes them directly from birth and devours them. Hence this whole idea of Saturn 'consuming' in the lyrics. \n\r\nThe 'stone' mentioned comes in as well--Zeus, who's craft is everlasting, decides he wants to succeed his father, and to avoid being devoured, he takes a chance, and dresses a stone in child's clothing. Cronos is fooled by the ruse and consumes all children but Zeus, and the stone. Zeus then overthrows Cronos and reigns as the Prime Deity. \n\r\nWhile I'm sure there are other intended meanings, you can see how I came to take this song as \"The Grudge\" of children against the oppression of their authority figures, and the chances they took to overcome and improve their conditions of living. \n\r\nMaybe I'll also mention the part where the ocean transmutates Ouranos' castrated grudge of a penis into Aphrodite (Roman Venus).\n\r\nAgain, I'm sure this song isn't a literal telling of the Cosmogony, but it has some hints towards it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_10": "\nok i don't get it. why are a lot of people saying \"What this song means is...\"? what they should be saying is \"What this song means to ME is...\". people shouldn't just be putting words in maynard's mouth. although some theories may be true, you'll never really know what the hell a song means because you aren't the one who wrote it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nallrighty first comment on this site k\r\nits not maynard its tool its a collective thought on all members of the band they all agree its just that maynard is the brilliant one with the words, danny carey is the brilliant one that actually composes most of the actuall music, one does the videos and other art shit anywayse its tool not one of the magnificant men, tool is also multi-interperated, i really like the use of saturn in this song and the relation to comes around again cause saturn was a ancient god that judged people and it would come around twice in ur lifetime... and it would judge your life ur choices and your values ect..., in a way that god does in monotheistic belifs buty u chose 1 or 10 theyre was no gray area u held on to ur grudge or let it go, but that is me and tool is great but baboons will be baboons. . . .\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nlead and gold are both heavy. even if the leaden anchor were transmuted into gold, it'd still drag you down.\n\r\nalso, the song points out (by means of repetitios implication) that holding a grudge also tends to fabricate a vicarious point of existence. for instance, take the widely-used (in American mass-media, at least) cliche of some bad-assed protagonist's family, friend, well-loved pet, etc. being mercilessly slaughtered. he'll cry for awhile, then he'll get a gun and start killing people and blowing shit up left and right. he is more-or-less immortal, kept alive only by his resolve to kill all of the antagonists before finally either dying or riding off into the sunset.........still, all thats accomplished is more people having been hurt and killed.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nMaynard is such an amazing charater, his music and meanings have made me have a whole different look on life and has changed me.

It makes perfect sense. \n\r\nSaturn is esoterically linked to Karma. Saturn intensifies feelings of isolation, sadness, depression, etc. Cronus spent the last of his life as a prisoner of Tartarus, a dark, gloomy place that can be described as a pit of blackness. Depression is often a pit of darkness to those who suffer from it. Saturn, badly aspected, gives us this feeling. But once the dark side of Saturn is recognized, his bright side can be brought into view and enhanced. Sadly, Saturn has been regarded only as miserable and attributed to despair and darkness, lending to the thought that there is no way to escape it's confines. Feelings of shame, fear, guilt and humiliation shackle us and keep us confined to the pit of darkness. The way to get out of the pit is to stop placing blame on others and take personal responsibility for our situation in life.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\nAs with many Tool lyrics, these have deep spiritual meaning. It's a very simple truth.  You don't have to cut the songs into a million pieces to realize that he is writing as his own ego.  The EGOIC (thought based on form) mind clings to suffering to form our self projected identity.  It's not who we are, Watch your thoughts and you'll realize that they are happening to you, it might make you laugh.  GRUDGES cause suffering to yourself, it's pointless because what happened happened, it is what it is now, the past is the past and does not exist but as a thought. until people start to recognize that these thoughts (grudges, hatred, the ego loves it, the ego is that bastard thinker of your thoughts.  You can either sit in the unconsious state and watch it happen or do something about it.  the way the song is written is through the egoic (thought projections without basis) mind singing.  If you let go of your grudge your ego will lose part of it's identity, which seems bad at the time but in the long run can be a blessing. it CONSUMES YOU. It took me a long road of suffering to realize that there is an easy way out of that prison cell and that is through recognizing that bastard voice we all have which is the ego telling us what's good and bad, keeping hold of that grudge, the longer you hold it the stronger the ego gets.  I know I wrote a lot and no one has to agree with it but if you read this far certainly you must see some truth in it? your-self implies two. Can't live with your self? = 2 then recognize it and live as yourself. (see parabola for another crystal clear truth) Past and future are just thought forms, right now is the gateway and if you get angry at this examine that thought.  Eckhart Tolle helped me realize most of that. Just realized Tool is hitting on the subject bigtime, it's like talking code to the egoic mind though. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nJust wanted to leave a bit of feedback about the use of Saturn in this song...\n\r\n\"Saturn is the planet of responsibility and symbolizies the ethic of hard work. Under its influence a person's character is strengthened through trial and difficulty. It has been said that Saturn disciplines us until we can learn to discipline ourselves.\n\r\nSaturn was a symbol for Father Time, for he brought to an end all things that had a beginning.\n\r\nIn astrology, Saturn is the planet of diligence, self-control, and limitation. Its domain is patience, stability, maturity, and realism. Its influence is stern and restrictive, cold and severe.\n\r\nSaturn is called the Celestial Taskmaster, for it teaches us the lessons we must learn in life. In the grand plan of the universe, Saturn does not give us more than we can handle. Under Saturn's influence we achieve by overcoming obstacles and hardships. Somtimes the effort itself is the reward, for effort is what builds character. In the end, what we learn under Saturn's influence we keep for the rest of our lives.\n\r\nSaturn gives the power to endure and provides the tenacity and perserverance to realize your potential. Saturn's effect is to delay rewards until they are earned. It perfects human nature while it bestows an ability to wait. It is the planet of courage, steadfastnes, and integrity.\n\r\nIn its symbolic form, Saturn is our destiny.

He's making fun of them for giving in to such a savage and pointless concept. I do not truly believe that he thinks knowing whats wrong, and who to blame give you a sense of worth.

The Metal genre is usually stereotyped as angry and hateful but this is another song that proves it wrong.\n\r\nThis song is about a hate or a grudge. Something has happened to you that you can't let go of that you can't undo. It festers and seethes within you. a Grudge this deep can take hold of a person until all thats left is that feeling.\n\r\nThis song is that process. and its ultimately telling you to let go and be free.\n\r\nThey sing as your grudge as being a corner stone. Something that holds up the foundation of your life. Anchoring you to one spot. The best part of the song however is the last verse. Speaking of the ocean, letting it kiss you clean of your anger and hate. Letting go of that Grudge and letting the anchor it had become sink into the sea. Water in many traditions and stories has been cleansing.

I found an interview with Maynard where he explains it.  (Not word for word) He basically says when you're born, Saturn is in a specific position.  It takes about 28/29 years for it to make a full rotation around the sun back to it's original position.  This represents a time in your life when you can evaluate where you are.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_25": "\nThis song is obviously about the failure of men to let go. Every person has things she likes or dislikes. She wants to get what she likes, and struggles to change what she doesn't like. \n\r\nAlmost everyone must have probably heard the definition \"control freak\". Those people can't stand anything happening outside their grasp. I think every person has this to a certain degree. This song is about our struggle to control and change everything. \n\r\nI smell Buddhism all over this album and this song is no exception. Gautama Buddha says there are no errors or no flaws in anything. Everything is perfect and everything is just what it is supposed to be. Everything is in perfect harmony. It is our \"ego\" which interprets them as good or bad. The ego is formed because we want to identify ourselves. If you are neutral about everything, then you are no one. So driven by this instinct, we form something called \"ego\" which is no more than a dirty glass we wear. It makes us perceive things according to some components (a very simple example : you ate a stale apple in childhood which caused a serious nausea you still don't like apples) which are formed during our experiences, mainly in childhood.\n\r\nSo to summarise, we are not \"programmed\" from the start to like or dislike things, it is just a struggle of our consciousness trying to identify itself. \n\r\nSo to go one step further, we try to change or erase things we find faulty. Or we try to control things we like because of the fear that they can go astray. \n\r\nWhat we must do is to accept everything as themselves and make peace with the things we don't like.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_26": "\nI loved everyone's thoughts thanks for sharing guys!

There are multiple obvious references to the cold war, being:\n\n-\"Scarlet letterman\", red, commonly used to describe communist, and letterman being surname, or more importantly origin. In other words, unable to forgive the individuals from communist origin.\n\n-\"Ultimatum prison sell\", countries constantly trapped in their threats to others. Notable examples of ultimatums, during the cold war are the conflicts on the borders of east and west Berlin, where both parties were trapped, unable to give up, or win. \n\n-\"Calculate what we will, and will not tolerate\", obviously referencing the response to threat strategies employed by the US and USSR.\n\nI don't think the song is SPECIFICALLY about the cold war, but it does use it as an anecdote, or example. We infer the overall message the Tool are pushing in this song is that people need to:\n\n\"let go\" of global conflict. \n\nThe references to Saturn, are references to the Greek god, which suggests some sort of revolution (as Saturn was know for leading his associates into a mythical revoltuion).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_28": "\nI'm shocked to see most people think its literally about grudges, and that nobody knows who David Icke is. Go to YouTube and watch David Icke's speeches about Saturn and the reptilian race. In short, aliens of the ancient past have been farming and literally controlling the human race, using Saturn as a massive broadcast tower and the moon as an amplifier. On the north pole of Saturn is a hexagonal gas formation. That shape in nature happens only when there is a frequency distortion, sort of like when you see people create amazing geometrical shapes with sand on a plate which is sitting on a large speaker. The rings around saturn are literally the same that you see on a CD. It's not acoincidence, it's a fact that saturn is producing strong frequencies, and we have no idea why. The frequencies being blasted from saturn are literally codes of instruction that control the behaviors of humans. The so called \"junk DNA,\" aka the 90%+ of our DNA that scientists have no idea what it is, is the program code that the aliens designed us with in order to receive and react to these frequencies. Scientists also have no idea why the moon has the density, or lack of, that it is. It should have a much higher mass and gravitational pull, but it doesnt. David Icke explains the hollow moon theory, which is actually more convincing than the lack of science explaining why it's so lightweight. In fact, Neil Degrasse Tyson even said that it's easier to explain the non existence of the moon, than to explain it exists. David Icke explains that the reason for this is the moon is acting as an amplifier to Saturn's frequencies. Consider what Tool fans say is the \"proper\" order of listening to Lateralus. You start with the last track which is audio from the radio broadcast where the Area 51 worker is frantically explaining that aliens will triangulate on us soon before the FCC cut the feed. That song transitions into the Grudge, which speaks very literally about Saturns affect on humanity. Now, re read the lyrics, and tell me every metaphor about prison, defining, controlling, and transforming after we break free, isnt exactly the theory David Icke proposed. Maynard is hiding the meaning of the song by being so extremely literal about it that we're blinded by it. In fact, you could even argue that the entire album is based on the Saturn theory. We are eternal, all this pain is an illusion - the illusion is the fake reality the aliens have created by broadcasting these signals. Ride the spiral to the end, it may just go where no ones been - the rings of saturn spiral, but literally ending the spiral means there is no more broadcast, and then the human race is free. And dont even get me started on the occults symbols relationship to Saturn ;)\n\r\nSeriously though, listen to Lateralus again after watching David Icke's lectures.

Hmm, I had a long post on here, maybe I can say this again without rambling.  Basically, I related the song to some psych theories of Karl Jung, which almost always tie in mythological and astrological aspects of our culture.  I think it's worth doing again.  First, I think the Saturn (king of titans) reference is valid, but perhaps not the only reason for mention of saturn.  The metaphors of transmutation of lead into gold--like medieval alchemists attempted to do--lead me to Jungian theory. (Some Jungian influence has been seen in tool before, such as the album Aenima, especially 46 & 2).  Anyway, Jung called an issue that must be confronted (like a grudge, per se) \"base matter,\" \"lead\", or \"saturn\" (names known to alchemists).  Some sort of heat/process is required to transmute it to gold--something good and beautiful obviously--which could be confrontation/resolution of the grudge.  So this reference I think covers many lines of the song.  Also, Jung considered astrological phenomenon and mythology in culture important to the subconscious...perhaps Maynard thinks ties like that are important too, since Jung's ideas have had influence on him.  Personally the application of Jungian theory seems to be central to this song's lyrics, with myth/astrology secondary (always more than a single meaning).\n\r\nGreat song though, I always hate to analyze the good ones to any point beyond getting a basic understanding of them.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_32": "\nOh yeah, where I said \"issue to be confronted\" that really means anything that you make fully  conscious.\n\r\nAlso, the transmutation metaphor fits the song nicely, as far as letting go of the grudge.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_33": "\nI've read a few Jung books and I gotta agree with Almighty that Maynard has used some jungian theories in his songs.

They have gone there many times before.  They go there because they don't want to go to a stinkin' resort type place, they don't like all the rules.  Many of them have kids now and they come too.  But the whole time they're worried about what the kids should and shouldn't be doing.  They're constantly telling them not to do things and I bet that this is exactly how they said they didn't want to raise their kids.  I was listening to this song while I was about to go to sleep and I kept on relating it to the adults in the way they raise their kids and in the substances they abuse.  For the 3 days that we were there they were drinking from about 11 in the morning until they went to bed and some of them get high too.  They don't realize that they have to let go of these things if they want to be the best possible parents for their kids.  The best example was my cousin who is a few years older than I and has a son of her own(she isn't married either).  She drinks and smokes weed, she leaves her son with her parents a lot while she goes out partying, basically she doesn't raise her son.  Marijuana, or any drug for that matter, is the worst thing you can do while you are raising children and IT MUST STOP!  If there's one think that our generation must learn from Tool, our parents, and even the older kids of our generation, it's that we have to learn when to stop making stupid mistakes.  If we're still fucking up while we're trying to raise kids, then they're just going to be fuck ups as well.  Life is all about the younger kids because they are life.  If you took the time to read this post I hope you agree with me or have learned something from it.  It's time to grow up, we do know more than our parents and we can see what the real problems are.

Let's take Christianity for example, something we know that Maynard has strong opinions about (Opiate, Judith, Eulogy).\n\r\nMaynard is describing people who need to hold on to their beleifs despite all defying logicial or spiritual influences, in order to stabalize their lives. Holding a Grudge against all possible truths that could defy or disprove that beleif is the grudge that is described. \n\r\n\"Calculate what we will or will not tolerate\" speaks of weighing between what to accept and what not to, according to that central beleif, thereby attempting to \"control all and everthing.\"\n\n\n\r\nHe says \"Clutch it like a cornerstone, otherwise is all comes down.\" Meaning that he can't let go of his beleif (religion, whatever) or else everything else will crash down with it, the mental structure that you've built for your life.\n\r\nHe's willing to \"Justify denials and Grip 'em to the lonesome end,\" placing himself in a virtual prison cell, created by this limitations that he's send for his mind. (what he will and will not tolerate, confining and defining factors). \n\r\nThen comes the references of Saturn ascending, and aspect of this song that you cannot ignore. As stated in previous posts, Saturn completes its orbit around the earth every 27 or 29 years, therefore beginning a new one. This is supposed to be a time of renewal, of the heart and mind. This may be a reference to a midlife crisis, someone going through this process and possibly coming to the epiphany that the beleifs in their life are false, challenged by new insights. \n\r\n\"Hang on or be Humbled again\" refers to the choice of remaing stalwart to a cause or releasing and accepting, a life changing choice.  He is torn between his inevitable acceptance, and then the release of his grudge. \n\r\n\"Lifts you up like a child Or drags you down like a stone to Consume you till you Choose to Let this go.\" This again illustrates the two possibilities of acceptance or continued denial, and their emotional impacts. Although here, he insinuates again that acceptance is inevitable. \n\r\nThe end stanza refers to the release of the grudge, allowing this \"cold and fated anchor\"   (the grudge/stone) to be \"transmuted\" (changed) into gold.\n\r\n...and that...is the result of my heavy obsession with tool's lyrics.\n\n\n", "comment_40": "\njoshthack, i totally agree with you. so much information is avaliable to us today about the damage we are doing our bodies and spirits by abusing them. we do have to stop, we cant plead ignorance as our excuse anymore. as for the song, u guys are so amazing, u tell me everythign i could possibly need to know about the meaning of all of tool's songs! i love reading what you write cos there is no way i'd come up with this stuff myself! \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_41": "\ni think this song is about maynard having a hangover.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_42": "\nDon't forget to notice the 2001 a Space Odysee refernaces :D....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_43": "\nthe song is basically about negativity, and mocking people who hold grudges etc. the first line of the song, \"wear your grudge like a crown of negativity\" is a metaphor, meaning that he is mocking people that tend to show off how negative they are, therefore wearing it like a crown. then \"calculate what we will or will not tolerate\" means that he is now mocking them for finding out exactly what piss people off & doing it purposely just to be negative. \"desperate to control all and everything\" is self-explanitory. \"unable to forgive your scarlet letterman\"...actually i'm not quite sure what this means but i'm guessing it means he is mocking them for not forgiving anybody, and just simply holding a grudge. then here's where the part about the stone comes in: \"clutch it like a cornerstone, otherwise it all comes down\"...he is now saying that negative people will hold their negativity and grudges because they don't want people to see them as positive. \"justify denials and grip them to the lonesome end\" means that they are now making up reasons to be negative and will stick with the reasons until the end, in which they will be all alone. now the part that confused me at first, the whole thing about \"saturn ascends\"...well, i thought it referred to the planet saturn, but i thought about it for awhile & it makes perfect sense if it is referring the roman god saturn, who was so worried that he would be overthrown (that he ate his own children), until one day he was killed by jupiter. i guess this is a metaphor for people with negativity not wanting to be positive, but one day they will be killed or something, i don't know i still really haven't figured it out....anyway, \"unable to forgive and we're sinking deeper\"...this one's a give-away of what it means. they're sinking deeper in negativity & they can't forgive anyone. then finally at the end of the song, maynard quits mocking negative people and now tells them this: \"give away the stone\" (referring back to the whole cornerstone thing, meaning if you give it away you will just give up on negativity)...\"let the oceans take and transmute this cold and weighted anchor\" (i'm guessing the weighted anchor and cold was the grudge holding you down (?)....\"give away the stone. let the waters take and transmute these leaden grudge into gold.\" (if you \"give away the stone\", you could actually turn your negativity into something good)...and then the final words (after the awesome 30-second long scream) are just simply \"let go\", which you should definately know what that means by now. so there, your overly long explanation.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_44": "\nHrrrrrrrrrrrrr.....

Whether this has some metophorical interpretation is questionable. If Maynard did have a metophirical meaning for planet, it would be undoubtably be repeated in other songs, for he has a habitual habit of this. To me this song is about galileo, and his discovery of the formation of the planets in the solar system, namely, the sun is the centre, not us. The way Galileo disproved the church's model of the universe was to trace the path of the moons around the larger planets, namely Jupitar and Saturn. The church had said that the planets sat on crystal stands, but how could these stands exist when these moons were flying directlty through them. Only a hundred years before Copernicus was burnt at the stake for defying the church's model of the universe, so obviously the church had somewhat of a grudge against these freelance scientists who were on a mission to disprove the church. And the church were 'terrified of being wrong,' the people couldn't 'let go' of their faith, or the church would lose power over them, the church wanted to 'control all and everything,' for in those days, the church acted as goverment. So 'Saturn came around to show them everything,' to show the followers the faults in christianity. The lyric 'clutch it like a cornerstone' would be directed at the church, its like saying, \"hold on to your faith while you've still got it.\" The cornerstone originating from the saying, \"a cornerstone of faith.\" And I don't think I really need to backup Maynards feelings on religion, just listen to Euology!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_47": "\nhaha i found out this one when i was stoned.....but u guys already mentioned just about everything, but it thought it was tight when he was like \"Give away the stone, let the waters kiss and transmutate these leaden grudges into gold\" and i found out that that means to be baptized, perhaps when the world was flooded??? \"give away the stone\" (take away the actual land of the earth) \"let the waters kiss\" (let them cover all of the land) \"and transmutate, these laden grudges into gold\" be baptized...get rid of the grudge. just my .02\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_48": "\nSaturn ascends, choose on or ten has a basis in Enochian and hermetic majik (if you'll notice my post under \"faaip de oiad\" there is a lot of occult reference on this album)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_49": "\ni found out something that could relate to the \"saturn ascends,choose one or ten\" part of the song. if you look on the back cover of the salival set (the plastic part with the ten circles connected by lines) that is the \"tree of life\" which is the basis of all existance, according to Qabalists.\n\r\nThe first sphere is known as Kether and is the crown (top) of the tree.

They are also naturally irritating and suspicious.

Written here is a very basic description of the song and what each line means to me, based on my knowledge of Qabala and its interworkings.  If anyone is interested in learning more about the other Tool songs or how the Qabala plays it role throughout each, just ask and I will start writing more in depth on it.  Overall I think the basic theme of this song is that through change comes hardships which must be overcome to acheive something greater.  This song refers to something more than a materialistic life, and to that of the soul behind what we do.  It also mainly refers to Saturn's influence on our lives like schism86 said.  The Grudge's placement on Qabala and the Tree of Sephirot would be in its 10th spot, in Malchut (\"World\").  Anyway heres my very basic meanings(mind the poor condition of spacing due to the fact that its all typed up and copied over from my WordPad documentation):\n\r\n\"Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.\"\r\n\tUse your soul as that of a marking of the power in denial.\r\n\"Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.\"\r\n\tFind out what you keep and what you change.\r\n\"Desperate to control all and everything.\"\r\n\tStrive to control every factor that influences change.\r\n\"Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.\"\r\n\tCannot forgive what has been done through whats right or wrong.\n\r\n\"Clutch it like a cornerstone.

You all know his mythological position. You've even touched on a little of the planetary revolution being 27 years and all...that's nice. That's probably the closest thing you've all said to the meaning of the metaphor...though inadvertantly. Think... \"Saturn\" the ROMAN version of the father of the gods, borrowed from GREEK mythology. What was the Greek versions name you ask? Why it was \"CHRONOS,\" the ruler, creator, and god of all there was and what would be--the Greeks cyclic/seasonal concept of time, or passing of events. And what is Chronos the root of etimologically. Why the word Chronology, meaning of or relating to time. So, Maynard is pointing to the word \"TIME\"...in a clever indirect sense, as well as the story of Saturn.

His performance on The Late Show was censored and he was not allowed back on the show. after this, Bill Hicks wrote and 39 page letter to John Lahr from The New Yorker in protest. His act was the first ever to be cencored at the Ed Sullivan's Theater. The reason for the cencorship was his all-out attack on prolifers. He said something like:\n\r\n\"If you're so pro-life, do me a favour: don't lock arms and block medical clinics. If you're so pro-life, lock arms and block cemeteries.\"\n\r\nDavid Letterman later apologized for this incident, although it was, sadly, after Bill Hicks had perished. \r\nThe reason I believe that this song, to a certain degree is about this incident, is because of the line\r\n\"Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.\"\n\r\n Of course, it's a long shot, but it seems sensible, since Bill Hicks was very aggressive in his material, and he held a grudge against CBS for quite some time. Also, Tool have previously honored Bill Hicks. It is also widely believed that the song \"Eulogy\" is about Bill Hicks, and that \"Aenima\" was inspired by Bill Hicks' material.

Although of these things very large volumes have been written by the antient wise men, so that there is no need to declare them here, notwithstanding I will recite a few of them; for they made, from the operations of Saturn, Saturn ascending in a stone, which is called the load-stone, the image of a man, having the countenance of a hart, and camel's feet, and sitting upon a chair or else a dragon, holding in his right hand a scythe, in his left a dart, which image they hoped would be profitable for prolongation of life; for Albumasar, in his book Sadar, proves that Saturn conduces to the prolongation of life; where, also, he says that certain regions of India being subject to Saturn, there men are of a very long life, and die not unless by extreme old age.

This may be someone who gives you a heads up. It progressively rears its head on you, the grudge, and then you realize you are begrudging others for inhabiting their OWN being. The realization that one can slink into this is cause for self-reproach, moreover. That others possess content identical to your own makes you not only question the grounds for your own self-identity but strikes at something even more fundamental: do I really OWN anything I think? Is it a product of my own adeptness or more likely do things just occur to me in too similar a character as it does for all if not many other beings. He can realize he is being seen as someone with a grudge. Trying to cling to some last shred of something substantial or all his own, he 'wears his crown of negativity'. Get an image of Jughead's paper tapped crown... 'yes, and?' So he sets out provisionally, awkwardly and with abandon to reconstruct his character (which can never be anything more than a self-percept) about this grudge. It doesn't seem to be a move made to advance ground with any scarlet lettermen, it is a move made in last dash for an inward sense of peace. Hang on or be humbled again, likely what should be inferred from the scarlet letterman's prompt. I have read briefly that Saturn is usually evoked as a symbol for the epithets 'the opportune moment for harvesting from life' and 'the death of old ways'. Also, more abstract and generally designated meanings of authority, steadiness, construction, integrity. So, yes the grudge could be spawned from someone keeping you in check. What spins the grudge tighter is your lacking the grounds to utterly hate them based on a smooth, kindred, genuine delivery they made for you, with whatever that sentiment is. Some specific species of love. The grudge and concomitant self-loathing is escaped from temporarily by denying of others their real inhabited being, 'justify denials', which is to go back to a state before the letterman spoke, where the now grudge-holding was conceiving himself or simply reclining into the self-percept of being the master of the show. While this might have something to offer in other spheres, when it enters into issues concerning realizing or evoking, if you are an idealist, the presence of others it can cause some problems. While it may be true of you it is just as well true of the other, in like character. The letterman called your behavior, preconscious or calculated, into the open maybe. Cause for soreness or indignation, seems to be the case in The Grudge. This is not someone with any immediate desire to seek a sort of penance. A sort of penance is the way out. Perhaps the grudge has an inherent recursive structure, meaning it rebounds or linearly, thought about the character of the grudge causes its character to get more pronounced. One has met a blockade which may be rerouted or assuaged with some ol' integral penance: acknowledgement of self-deceiving behavior and appropriate recompense in a spirit of seriousness. The fact that the grudge holder can understand himself to be occupying this pending position incites them to resign themselves to smoldering in fecklessness. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_110": "\ni dont think this song even has a really straight foreward meaning, but nonetheless its a god song, one of the best of lateralus\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_111": "\nand cutyou i love the comparison between the song and fight club\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_112": "\nI'm not sure if anyone else mentioned this, and I'd hate to repeat, but about the \"scarlet lettermen.\"  Hawthorne wrote the novel \"The Scarlet Letter.\"  It's about being punished for a sin that the character committed.

In the book the scarlet letter, the scarlet letter was a peice of cloth with the letter \"A\" for adultry.  It was sewn in to her clothes so everyone knew what she did.  In modern times a scarlet letter is known to be a mark of shame.  So what do I think this song is about?  Coming out.  Yep I said it.  Now before you blow away my theory at least hear me out.\n\r\n\"Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity\"  \r\nIf you've ever seen a gay person in denial (if theyre good at it you'll never know), they'll publicly denounce anything that may cause suspicion, even if it goes against what they feel inside.\n\r\n\"Calculate what we will, or will not tolorate\"\r\nSelf explainatory, stay inside the lines or risk being different.\n\r\n\"Desperate to control all and everything\"\r\nAlso self explainatory.  Trying to make sure all your actions are predetermined, and you have full control of all your actions.\n\r\n\"Unable to forgive your/these scarlet lettermen\"\r\nThe scarlet lettermen are the ones pinning the letter on you, but you arnt able to come to terms with it.  \n\r\n\"Clutch it like a cornerstone \r\nOtherwise it all comes down\"\r\nClutch your beliefs and the person you've created as tightly as you can, otherwise your whole life will change, even if it may be for the better.\n\r\n\"Justify denials and \r\nGrip 'em to the lonesome end\"\r\nAnother key point in the song that seems to be overlooked.  It seems a bit too obvious that he used the word \"denial\" here, which is often used for people in the closet.  If you justify them, you will obviously cut off all potential relationship and be alone for the rest of your life.\"\n\r\n\"Clutch it like a cornerstone \r\nOtherwise it all comes down \r\nTerrified of being wrong \r\nUltimatum prison cell\"\r\nPeople in denial almost always see being gay as \"wrong\".

(Hence \"clutch it like a cornerstone\")  Sepher Malchut is also called \"Kingdom,\" and is the realm of the earth, of the body, and immediate physical sensations. MALCHUT is before thought. It is in the \"Assiah\" world, the precinct of human embodiment. Qabalistic meditation and pathwork should always be firmly grounded in MALCHUT. Anyways, this is the beginning, where the soul is united with source. This is the beginning of separating desire, the urge to individuate. The realm of separating desire is among the middle sephirot, with desire for source bringing reunion in Keter. The number \"ONE\" refers to concentration, attention, and focusing the field of activity.\n\r\n    Saturn's placement at birth influences the person's work in life, their obstacles, the challenges that will test them and build character. Saturn shows how a person will mature, and how they will learn to cope with adversity. Saturn teaches transformation, and initiation. Saturn's rewards are the sweetest, for they are the hardest won. Afflictions to Saturn can create inhibition, timidity, cruelty, violence, melancholy, a knack for trouble, bad work situations, abuse of power, or resentment. Saturn, and the earth signs it rules, are the arbiters of the highest initiation. Christ, Buddha, and the Virgin Mary are Capricorn, Taurus, and Virgo, respectively, in our mythic systems. Initiation is earned, and only when the aspirant can use higher consciousness in the Real World is the initiation authentic. Saturn is associated with the \"Ring Pass Not\" - a term normally used when referring to the orb of energetic influence of a planet or body, and can also be applied to other forms of life. The ring-pass-not is the combination of the different energy sheaths that human or cosmic spirits gather around themselves.\n\r\n    \"A profoundly mystical and suggestive term signifying the circle or bounds or frontiers within which is contained the consciousness of those who are still under the sway of the delusion of separateness -- and this applies whether the ring be large or small. It does not signify any one especial occasion or condition, but is a general term applicable to any state in which an entity, having reached a certain stage of evolutionary growth of the unfolding of consciousness, finds itself unable to pass into a still higher state because of some delusion under which the consciousness is laboring, be that delusion mental or spiritual.\"\n\r\n    Saturn is the boundary between the inner or \"personal\" planets, and the outer, \"impersonal\" planets. The inner planets are about refining our responses; the outer planets are things beyond our conscious control. Perhaps the most carefully watched planet (other than the moon) is Saturn, which has a 28 year orbit through the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The dreaded \"Saturn Return\" is just one of many Saturn tests we are put through. When Saturn, in its year to year progress, aspects its position in a person's birthchart, it performs its function: it tests, analyzes, it challenges. For about two years, 28 year olds face themselves and hard reality, usually as never before. Spending a little over two years in each sign, Saturn tweaks itself against its own position in the natal chart every seven years. (Two squares, an opposition, and a conjunction - the \"return.\") Thus, the 7 year old's first loss of dreamy childhood innocence, the 14 year old's hormonal hurricane, the 28 year old's full fledged adulthood, and so on. The milestones of 55 and 56 usually mark turning points in people's lives. In its 28 year journey, Saturn also aspects the other points in a natal chart, and it is useful to keep an eye on Saturn vis-a-vis your other natal planets. Most people can map changes and stages in their lives just by looking at Saturn's position for a particular time. A long period of testing in your life can often be traced to a Saturn square with your natal Sun, Moon, ascendant, or other planets. Saturn's connection to 'The World,' Key 21, and earthiness, is symbolic of its hard reality. The square and the cross are associated with matter; while we live on this earth, we are like spirits nailed to a cross, clutching our cornerstone. Spirit, coping with material existence, is forced into transformation, and growth. People with strong Saturns are slow to change, so Saturn aspects often mean the difference between testing and Heavy Testing. Alchemy, on the surface, was the medieval attempt to turn lead into gold. It is really a metaphor for a much greater work, that of transforming the 'leaden' soul into the 'soul of gold.'\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_131": "\ni agree with some of the other posts. its about holding on to something that you base your life off of (in this case of course a grudge) but then struggle t o hang onto  to it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_132": "\nAGAIN as MAYNARD himself said-he reads some of these interpretations & theyre SO far off,BUT thats ok,As it means something different for everyone depending on the experiences in your life,where you're at in youre life,etc..though this song DOES have spefic references to apiritual alchemy or 'self gnosis'-'let the waters kiss,& transmutate the leaden grudges into gold'.Alchemy was the process of turning lead into gold,but more importantly a 'hidden meaning' for occultist(meaning anyone who perceived 'realities' the 'realm'-king-church or consensus didnt recognize)of turning base man into pure spirit,as tyou would base metals into gold.I knew someone woul;d mention the Kaballah &though SOME of LATERAUS has obvious references to it,theres a site that tries to link every song,every lyric into kabbalistic interpretations...\ntoolpantheon.com/\u2026\r\n Pretty interesting,again as we all have our own take on TOOL's meanings.They intentionally couch their songs in ambigious metaphors to FORCE you to think,before someone does it FOR you!\r\n AM\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_133": "\nThis song was released just a little while before a sun saturn opposition..... the feast of saturn takes place on december 17th, and in the year 2002, there was a sun saturn opposition that took place. it turned out that the sun and saturn completely opposed each other in the night sky.\r\n 2002 Dec 17 17:27  8.0519     +22\uff70 03'\r\n:)\n\r\nso i'm thinking it's just a little saturn worship.... nothing super-awesome or anything.....\n\r\nmaybe taht's what the song really means. :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_134": "\nMaybe I just have a different far-fetched take on this, but I feel this song might be about the Jewish oppression and what they have had to battle throughout the ages.\n\r\n\"Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity\" \r\nThey definitely have a reason to hold a grudge for the wrongdoing against their race thoughout the ages...and Jesus, a jew, wore a \"negative\" crown of thorns at his death.\n\r\n\"Calculate what we will or will not tolerate \r\nDesperate to control all and everything\"\r\nThey are tired of tolerating the prejudices, etc. that have been done to them.

You were born as Saturn rose in the east. The closer Saturn was (see orb) to being exactly on the eastern horizon - your Ascendant - when you were born, the more reluctant you as a soul were to come into your body. Your birth was probably difficult for your mother, and if Saturn is within a few degrees of your Ascendant (see orb), may have caused her great trauma, a Caesarian, or in extreme cases even death.\n\r\nBob Dylan's verse, \"I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.\" is really true of your life. You were born old, and had many responsibilities while still a child, as well as a feeling of not having been loved at an early age. There's often a feeling of lost childhood with this placement of Saturn. As you mature into an adult you will have the desire and the opportunity to regain and relive some of your lost youth.\"\n\r\n'The Grudge' may be a reference to these unspoken resentments.

It could also relate to the myth of Saturn, read up on it, v. interesting\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_187": "\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY MAYNARD!!! hes turning 40 on the 17th of APRIL\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_188": "\nwhat does \" scarlet lettermen\" refer to ?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_189": "\nJesus\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_190": "\ncrown of thorns = Jesus \r\ngrudge = crucifixion\n\r\n\"Saturn comes back around to show you everything \r\nLet's you choose what you will, will not see and then \r\nDrags you down like a stone or lifts you up again \r\nSpits you out like a child, light and innocent\" \r\nJUDGEMENT DAY\n\r\n\"Give away the stone, let the waters kiss and transmutate these leaden grudges into gold \"\r\nALCHEMY (ANCIENT FORMS) (remove restrictions)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_191": "\nThis record is a ritual process in my interpretation.  It begins with a cleansing sacrifice to move on to the next step.  \n\r\nIn Alchemy, the practitioner's goal is always to transmutate something worthless like led into gold (albiet that is a pretty basic view)  And this song is asking you to find one of those pieces of led in your life in the form of a grudge.  It begs that you identify it (clutch it like a corner stone) then asks you to see it in the bigger picture.  What good is this grudge doing you in your life.  How many missed opportunities or lost friendships has it cost you.  \n\r\n\"Wear the grudge like a crown, negativity, calculate what we will, will not tolerate desperate to control, all and everything\"\n\r\nThis is the kind of broken thinking we can fall prey too when fixating on a grudge.  But for the ritual to move foreword, a sacrifice needs to be made.\n\r\n\"Give away the stone, let the waters kiss and transmutate these leded grudges into gold\"\n\r\nNow, I don't care if you follow the same spiritual path that I do, this is a wonderful exercise for anyone, Listen to this point with your eyes closed, focus on a grudge.  Something specific.  Maybe not even a grudge, but something you need to move on from.  Now, try to imagine an object two wrap that feeling, action, grudge, into an object or symbol of some sort.  Imagine a large etherial space where you can hold it up in the palm of your hand (around the 6:00min mark)  Keep your hand extended and imagine this grudge being sandblasted by the sound.  And as they chant \"Let Go\" imagine that led symbol becoming something golden and usable.  You first must really want make this work though.  And be willing to let go.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_192": "\nAssuming you even look, you have Two ways you can see the Infinity.
