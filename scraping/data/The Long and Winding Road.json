Abbey Road is.  The disappointment and despair of the Get Back sessions led the Beatles to try and attempt one more album before they broke up, which was Abbey Road.

The road is long but it isn't as winding as the song suggests - it's fairly straight in most places. There are actually two roads to his place - the coastal road takes a little longer to drive but the ocean views are indescribably beautiful.

But before I knew any beatles history, when the beatles were just a 20 greatest hits tape to me, I thought it was about a man who wants to take a relationship to the next level, marriage. Many times before he has proposed and been turned down but he keeps coming to the same point in his relationships. The you in the song I didn't think was one person, but more like, all of the women he'd known. The \"many times I've been alone\" part is saying his relationships have been lost a lot there and hes cried about it but hes saying its not their fault because they don't know how many times hes tried (the Naked version blows this theory away though, maybe in the naked version she was just a bit of a bitch). And all the ways hes tried to propose or maybe even steer the relationship in a different direction, they keep leading him back to that same point.
