{"comment_0": "\nI don't know how this one could have gotten past me, but I just discovered this song. I guess everyone else already knew this, but clearly one of the master works of the era, and the amazing cover by Cash will likely seal it as an all-time classic. I want to share some of my thoughts about this song, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have time to write this as well as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like. Please forgive its excessive length. \n\r\nFirst, a note on the music. It's very unusual for a song from the rock tradition. No verse course arrangement, just a building repetition, interrupted early in the song by narration in the same voice. Clearly a product of its time, the studio version is produced as an \u00e2\u0080\u009calternative\u00e2\u0080\u009d cut with a pretty typical post-punk sound. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost like no one quite knew what to do with this song, including, one assumes, Cave himself. It takes a few listens for it to sink in that there is something much deeper going  on here than the style initially suggests. In later, live versions, Cave seems to have come to grips with exactly what he has here and performs it in a more fitting way. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not to take anything away from the studio version. The kind of weird juxtaposition of substance and style make it something that you have to discover and lets you go deeper into the song with repeated listens. The work it takes to pick through the pop veneer makes you appreciate your discovery that much more.\n\r\nThe construction of the song has a great trick that is remarkably effective. The chord progression itself is wonderful, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eight measures long, and seven of them build a tension that is only briefly resolved by the eighth before it immediately returns to uneasiness. It makes the whole song feel incredibly intense and unrelenting, which is analogues to the subject: a man on death row awaiting the electric char. \n\r\nWhich brings us to the lyric. There have been great song writers whose lyrics stand alone as poetic statement, but this has to be one of the best bits of poetry in its own right released on a rock record. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that I want it to be even better than it obviously is, but I read a little more into it than some. In the beginning monologue he proclaims his innocence, or at least sort of. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Later he talks about his hands and fingers, one evil and one good, of which he observes \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As if to proclaim his innocence, blaming the whole incident on these filthy five fingers. Tellingly, it is the \u00e2\u0080\u009ckill-hand\u00e2\u0080\u009d that \u00e2\u0080\u009cWears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He calls the ring \u00e2\u0080\u009ca long-suffering shackle collaring all that rebel blood\u00e2\u0080\u009d. \n\r\nI read all of that to give an ambiguous meaning to guilt or innocence. A man, maybe not cut out of the same cloth as everyone else, doing his best to live as society dictates but finding himself unable to live up to the expectations. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cognitive dissonance that eventually plays out in murder, but a murder this complex man does not blame himself for. This is a character that lives uncomfortably in a world not of his making. And as such, death can almost be welcome, a sentiment repeated throughout the song.\n\r\nThe middle verses about Jesus are the key to the whole thing, I think. He notes the irony that Christ was born and then, after making a life as a carpenter, he is crucified on a work of carpentry. He paints, quickly, a view of Jesus as another character who wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to live as others expected and ultimately met the same fate he himself awaits. He then goes on to further identify himself as a Christ figure by noting that He now sits on his heavenly throne, but down here it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made of wood and wire, an obvious reference to the electric chair he will soon take his seat in.\n\r\nBut what to make of that last line: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid I told a lie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think this is a confession of guilt. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already happened, really. We know he did it, and we know he did it for no reason anyone else could call \u00e2\u0080\u009cmotive\u00e2\u0080\u009d. So what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lie? I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a clue in the verse structure. The line comes in the same resolve measure that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repeatedly told us \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not afraid to die\u00e2\u0080\u009d. A man who has lived his life with conflicting thoughts once again has to face the fact that what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s told himself to be true may not be. As he climbs into what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s convinced himself is the mercy seat, he realizes that he actually is afraid. \n\r\nWeather he means it the way I hear it or not, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to argue that this song is anything but brilliant. Clearly one of the best songs of the era, maybe one of the best rock songs ever. As an observation at the end of a review about a song that deals with death, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say this to Nick Cave. Walk through life confidant that, in a world of mortal men, you have made a mark that transcends mortality. A true masterpiece that will leave a strong legacy. \n\n\n", "comment_1": "\nGreat work all. Cave is a master of metaphor and it is good to see so many people care about what he is actually trying to say.\n\r\nWhile there are many themes in the song, the predominant one uses guilt and innocence to explore the objectivity of truth. In this regard it is greatly influenced by books such as \"The Outsider\" and Crime and punishment. The \"I begin to chill to objects and their fields\" line is taken straight from Dostoevsky.\n\r\nFrom our characters view, having denounced mans right to judge him, God is the paradigm of truth, and the song explores the implications of such belief with great depth and subtle precision.\r\nThe uncertainty of his actions and and as such why he would commit them if they were wrong or unjust, leads to the analogies with Jesus, who is the ultimate victim of his own fate. \r\n It is fitting that as the song begins to reach it's climax and his disdain becomes bolder that he picks the wedding band, a symbol of Gods holiest institution on earth, as the shackle of his rebel blood, life and spirit, which is suggestive of a truth he can't explore, indicating the fallacy of his God.\n\r\nThe last line \"I'm afraid I told a lie\" is not a submission of guilt, it simply sums up a fearful yet enduring uncertainty on all matters, as he is not sure of guilt or innocence or god or truth or any other yardsticks, right or ability, to measure his supposed crime.\n\r\nCash's version is of a different flavor, his emphasis put on haunting nobility, a beat prince trudging towards a destined fate in almost heroic fashion, while Cage focuses on the subjective, with dark, all too human, undertones creeping through the prose. Which makes it, lyrically at least, a far more interesting work.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI must say that this song confirmes that nothing is black or white.

As already stated above, i believe in the final line he is admitting he is scared. i think the song could also be pointing out the ludicrousy of the belief that all things are \"good or ungood\". The convicted is shown as having conflicting morals as is shown by his good hand and the evil of his \"killing hand\" and also him being \"nearly, wholly innocent\". He himself is also not wholly good or bad, this could suggest, as is everyone. I think cave was trying to examine the meaning of evil (maybe this is pulling it apart too much) or/and get into the head of the murderer and imagine what the convicted was thinking as he was being put into the chair. Of course, the murderer could infact be cave himself and he's thinking about his own guilt: this could be true as other songs on this album talk about not wholly \"good\" characters in the first person.

Eminem also talks about this:  \"I am whatever you say I am , if I wasn't then why would i say I am?\"  The system can exert SO much pain upon the human soul, through it's earthly mechanisms, and that pain is unrelenting even into death - and threatens to be beyond it if the 'truth' ain't admitted to, that the 'good son' will surely confess - yield to whatever the system dictates is / should be the case.  The mercy seat is the ultimate place of cleansing - and that being so, being placed upon it to be cleansed, a man must surely need cleansing.  The best part is where death takes over and the man is cleansed - but not of his sin, but the sin of the system.  ie.  I am cleansed of you all.
