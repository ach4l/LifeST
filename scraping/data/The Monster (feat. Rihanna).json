{"comment_0": "\nI believe this song is just about Eminem's life as an artist. \"Call me crazy, but i have this vision, one day that ill walk amougst you, regular civilians.\" Hes say that he believes that one day he be a normal person and not have to deal with the negitive things of being famous. \"I aint here to save the f**king children, but if one kid out of a hundred million, who are going through a struggle, feels and relates, thats great\" he is saying that he is not writing songs that are for children to relate too, but if there are children, that are going through rough times, that listen to some of his songs to relieve some of their frustrations, then he thinks thats great. \"Im friends with the monster thats under my bed.\" Hes is speaking about slim shady, which is his vulgar alter ego. How he is friends with his alter ego, the\"monster\". \"Maybe i need a straightjacket, face the facts, im nuts for real, but im okay with that, its nothing.\" He his refering to his alter egos video \"my name is\" where he is wearing a straightjacket. He saying that he is really that weird and that he is okay with being that way, cause it doesnt affect him as a person, that he will countiue to be friends with his alter ego, slim shady, his monster, so he will continue to make some vulgar songs that slim shady creates. Marshell Mathers all the way!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis song is about schizophrenia. \"Friends with the monster that's under my bed\" is the halusinations and \"get along with the voices inside of my head\" is about the voices the person hears in their head. \"Your trying to save me stop holding your breath\" the hospitals and medication \"you think I'm crazy yeah you think I'm crazy\" is from how people say the things you say don't egsist. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThis song is tough- maybe his past is haunting him, like a monster from under his bed.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\ni think this is a generalization of obsessive compulsive intrusive thought disorder i.e the monster\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI feel like the person is damaged to some extent, possibly from past experiences or failures and is regretting that. The person claims to be \"friends with the monster under their bed,\" the opposite of normal reactions to a thought of that situation. Same with listening to the \"voices\" inside of their head. They reference a person or figure attempting to help them sort their life out and they block this person out. Hopefully anyone that feels they can relate eventually sorts their problems out! There are several references to famous figures in this as well, which add to the uniqueness of the song as well. One of Eminem's more laid-back songs, which I find to be a breath of fresh air from an artist like him.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nHere you go, the original lyrics, whatever is on here is what people think they heard.
