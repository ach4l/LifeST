He wrote Mama Said as a personal song which he was persuaded to put on the album. I think this one might be his 'album track' about his mother. In Mama Said he talks about needing her to love him and comfort him and now never being able to have that. I think the outlaw moniker here suggests the recklessness that drove him away from his mother and then the searching is his endless search for her love. If you have the S&M dvd, at \"the more I bless\", James folds his hands in prayer. I think he is symbolizing the idea that the closer he gets to a spiritual life, the more he is reminded of his mother's spirituality (which he believed had failed her - The God That Failed).\n\r\nI struggled a long time with the \"smash the clock\" line, but now I think I have it. It means he is angry at time for continuing on past this death and then the \"i'd rather die behind the wheel\" bit means he would rather have lived through that time with the person who died (his mother) than escaped it (by running off with the band). Sort of saying he would have rather struggled through rough years against his mother, secretly knowing her love than to have been free of the pain so early and never get that part of the relationship.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\na truely great piece of music i love kirks solo, this song made me think, the lyrics are so deep, this may be the way i would feel if i lost a close loved one. ne way metal up your ass!!!!!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nIs it me or Metallica is the most visited band on this site??????

The term Outlaw describes the individual, becuase if you've ever lost someone close to you, you go through a stage where you try to blame it all on yourself, making you feel like a criminal, or someone who's unwated, hence Outlaw. The reason the song has such a lonesome and sad theme is becuase its trying to convey the feelings you have when you just want to be seperated from the world. You just want to be left alone, but at the same time you want someone to help you through it, which leads me to the chorus. \n\r\nHear me\r\nAnd if I close my mind in fear\r\nPlease pry it open\n\r\nHere we have the individual wanting to shut themselves away from everyone, but desperatley wanting someone to intervene and lend a hand with the grief.\n\r\nSee me\r\nAnd if my face becomes sincere\r\nBeware\n\r\nTo me, this is the stage where you want absolutely no human contact. You lash out at everyone around you, trying your hardest to pushe everyone away so that you dont get close enough to anyone to get hurt again.\n\r\nHold me\r\nAnd when I start to come undone\r\nStich me together\n\r\nNow this is definatley after the grief and anger have subsided, all you want is someone to comfort you. You crave attention and desperately need someone there for you.\n\r\nSave me\r\nAnd when you see me strut\r\nRemind me of what left this outlaw Torn\n\r\nThese lines are about once the whole ordeal is done with, and you;ve started to move on, you feel almost obligated to not let anything joyful back into your life, like becuase that person is gone you dont deserve to be happy anymore.\n\r\nOk, now on to everyone favorite debate:\r\nYou make me smash the clock and feel\r\nI'd rather die behind the wheel\r\nTime was never on my side\r\nSo on I wait my whole lifetime\n\r\nThe line \"You make me smash the clock and feel\" to me describes the sheer madness that engulfs you after the intial shock of the ordeal, and how you want time to stop, you dont want to have to go on, you dont want to see the next day, and no matter how numb you feel from it all, you still feel the anger and grief tearing at you.\n\r\nOk, I know I'm going out of order, but this is just how I interpret it.\n\r\nNow, on to: \r\nAnd now I wait my whole lifetime... for you\r\nAnd now I wait my whole lifetime... for you\n\r\nI ride the dirt; I ride the tide... for you\r\nI search the outside, search inside... for you\n\r\nThis is the time period that is a few weeks, maybe even a few months after everything is said and done. \n\r\nThe lines: \"And now I wait my whole lifetime... for you\" are about how even long after the person is gone, you feel that somehow they'll be back. Something deep down still hopes that it wasn't real, but you know it is, so the terms \"my whole lifetime\" to me mean less of an actually time period, and more of the feeling of how the word \"lifetime\" portrays a sense of drearyness the way its sung. \n\r\n\"I ride the dirt; I ride the tide... for you\r\nI search the outside, search inside... for you\" to me is about how no matter how much time passes, somedays you'll search just about any memory for fragments of that person. Images of what they looked like, the feelings they gave you. \"I ride the dirt\" to me sounds like how sometimes all you can think about is the few fights you may have had with the person, or maybe the small flaws you used to point out in your head. \"I ride the tide\" is more of the good times you had with the person. \"I search the outside, search inside\" to me again is more literal of how on the outside you'll try to hold onto maybe a few pictures or even an article of clothing, whereas the search inside is again trying to latch onto the few memories you can still vividly remember.\n\r\nOk, for the last part.\n\r\nTo take back what you left me\r\nI know I'll always burn to be\r\nNo one seeks so I may find\r\nAnd now I wait my whole lifetime\n\r\n\"To take back what you left me\" to me means that you try your hardest to live up to any form of guidance, or try to follow something that person believed in, as if it would give you some kind of solace to know that you're carrying on maybe their dream or trying to succeed at something they failed.\n\r\n\"I know I'll always burn to be\" talks about how no matter how much time passes you still consider them to be your friend, and the passion in your heart never fades.\n\r\n\"No one seeks so I may find\" is about howyou feel hopeless soemtimes becuase you think that you're the only person who keeps the memories alive, and no one else cares anymore.\n\r\nOk, if you read that whole translation, I thank you for experiencing something very tragic that occured to me. I lost a very close friend in a very horrible way, and this song helped me through so much of it, I wanted to share my feelings about it. Again, it may not be how everyone feels, including the band, but maybe you can get a better personal connection to the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_34": "\nI think it could mean about how after Cliff died,they had such a hard time finding a replacement bassist.

It's not even sure if the protagonist exactly knows who he's seeking.\nThe last part is the protagonist motivation to continue his quest. His goal is the only thing he wants, so he doesn't want to fear anything that may distract him. If his face becomes sincere, the searched person shall beware, the protagonist is about to get his revenge.\nIf he starts to come undone, the goal will motivate him once more. This thought process seems to be what the song is about.\nThe protagonist wants his enemy to knock him down of his high point, once he see's him strut.\n\nOverall I think this makes sense, I can agree with what songanchorange said.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_48": "\nI always thought The Outlaw Torn was about James' internal battle between who he is really and who the public/fans think he is, and want him, and Metallica, to be...\n\n\"And now I wait my whole lifetime for you\"... I liken this line to Neil Peart's lyric in Rush's Limelight, \"I can't pretend a stranger is a long-awaited friend\". However, I also think there could be an element of fame addiction here as well.\n\n\"I ride the dirt, I ride the tide for you\"... Alludes to the continuous touring Metallica does to play for as many fans as possible.\n\n\"I know I'll always burn to be\"... Alludes to the Montreal incident that left James badly burned due to a pyrotechnics issue.\n\n\"The more I search, the more my need for you\"... James' further admission that fame and adulation are addicting, \n\n\"You make me smash the clock and feel, I'd rather die behind the wheel\"... Best lyric of the song, and probably the most debated. My interpretation of this line is that James is tired of getting up day after day after day, to cater to fans/kids that really don't know who he is, or really care. I do agree there may be a Cliff reference here; James was certainly distraught over Cliff's death and maybe a bit angry that he had to carry on while Cliff did not.\n\nAnd then there is the whole \"Hear me...\" lyrical bridge, literally begging the listener to understand that he (James) does not want to be this way, and to cut him some slack and help him to cope. My favorite line here is:\n\"And if my face becomes sincere... beware\"... This is James declaring that it's all fun and games until you push him to the breaking point, and then watch out, because he is Metallica... and you do not want to get Metallica mad at you.\n\nAbsolutely my favorite, and in my opinion, far and away the best track from the Load/ReLoad albums.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_49": "\nThis song is about not being able to move one from the death of a friend or lover.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_50": "\nIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this such a powerful song?

It is played during the quiet parts of the song. Before the very first lyrics \"and now i wait my whole lifetime\" there is a quiet part. Turn up the volume and you can hear bass notes. Is this just a tuned down guitar string or can the guitar not hit this low of a note? Why isn't newsted in the song credits if it is base? Is it a roadie? Geez...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_56": "\nThis song is clearly about an ongoing battle with drug/alcohol addiction. He's looking for something or someone who will make him feel the way he used to when he was high, who will fill that void in his life. The implication is that he fucks up, and will likely continue fucking up as he tells his friend/lover/whatever 'if i close my mind in fear, please pry it open...if my face becomes sincere, beware...when you see me srtut remind me of what left this outlaw torn' The profile here is that of a true addict, he wants closeness and companionship, but his ongoing search for internal peace leads him only back to his addiction. This in turn distances him from everyone, thus he is an outlaw and constantly torn between two states of being: sober and accepted/loved by whoever, or intoxicated and free of all restraint but alienated from those he cares for. This song perfectly expresses the ongoing hell that is recovery from addiction, all the while being very subtle about it. Awesome song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_57": "\nThis song is most definitely about the book The Outlaw of Torn by Edgar Burroughs \n\n\nAnd know I wait my whole lifetime... for you\nAnd know I wait my whole lifetime... for you\n(An allusion to the hole in Norman of Torns life that eats away at hime. He was raised by a fencing master to be a killing maching and thusly never recieved the love a father can provide, so on her searches for what can fill this hole.)\n\nI ride the dirt; I ride the tide... for you\nI search the outside, search inside... for you\n(Allusion to escapades Norman gets into as he plunders the country-side, but still missing something to make him whole\n\nTo take back what you left me\nI know I'll always burn to be\nNo one seeks so I may find\nAnd now I wait my whole lifetime\n(Norman of Torn lashes out at the de Vac who raised him as a killing machine but never taught him love and its true potential)\n\nOutlaw of Torn\nOutlaw of Torn\nAnd I'm Torn\n(Norman is Torn between pleasing de Vac an annihilating the English as he raised him to or trying to fill this void in his life that has been left by not receiving the love of his father growing up.)\n\nSo on I wait my whole lifetime... for you\nSo on I wait my whole lifetime... for you\nThe more I search, the more my need... for you\nThe more I bless, the more I bleed... for you\n(Search for love whether its through de Vac's wishes or his endevour with Bertrade, the daugter of de Montfort for whom he has a relationship with)\n\nYou make me smash the clock and feel\nI'd rather die behind the wheel\nTime was never on my side\nSo on I wait my whole lifetime\n(Again, he stills feels this whole that de Vac has created by raising Norman to be a brutal killing machine.

As de Vac is dying he reveals that Norman of Torn is in fact King Henry long lost son Richard who de Vac stole as a part of his plot for vengeance. In the end, its revealed that Norman did not die and awakes to reconcile with his real father and take the hand of Bertrade who is the daughter of de Montfort essentially ending the crisis between the two familes. The final stanza's in Metallica's so appear to be, and this is my opinion, Norman of Torn calling out to the newly found love in his life that his life has been a struggle and he isn't quite whole yet, but with there love he can be the best person he can be.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_58": "\nSomeone close to him died,\r\nI'd say he's seeking answers from someone who is dead\r\nWhen they died they smashed the clock because hetfileld began to feel emotions about that person he wanted to ignore, time was never on my side, maybe because time only matters with loved ones\r\nThey died and now he waits his whole lifetime\r\nDying behind the wheel , dying in the fast lane rather than feeling,,drugs alcohol whatever\r\nThe other person is someone he loves that he spilled those demons to, because this there the one that can save him with their love\r\nMy outlaw torn probably is that part of him that doesn't care and runs from pain\r\nTorn between love and hate\r\nThe Dark side of him \r\nMy outlaw eg the part of him that ran away from the pain and numbed himself\r\nHe says ' I know I'll always burn to be the one who seeks so I may find' \r\nSeeks answers to find himself who he was before that dead person changed him and tore his life to pieces with guilt and anger and hate \r\nBecause he loved them \n\r\nI think it's bout his mother\r\nI feel similar emotions about my father\n\n\n"}
