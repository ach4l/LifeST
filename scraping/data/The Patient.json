I Haven't read them all but I'm going to post what I think this song means from Maynard, and what this song means to me. First what I think Maynard wrote it as:\n\r\nIn this song he describes his journey as a musician. I'm going to break apart the main 'paragraphs' of this song sequentially. This might get a bit long...\n\r\n\"A groan of tedium escapes me, startling the fearful\"\r\nHe's groaning about how tedious it is to continually analyze his thoughts and translate them into an attractive message designed to get our attention and teach us something\r\n\"is this a \r\nTest? It has to be\"\r\nHe's talking about his life in general. Life is testing him, his way of passing the test is to send his message, teach what he's learned to as many as possible.\r\n\"otherwise I can't go on \r\nDraining patience, drain vitality, this paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little \r\nOld \"\r\nIn putting his message together he has to contantly think about the ignorant and unaware that he's 'teaching'. Just paying attention to them and trying to lift them up drains him. If this wasn't a test that he thought he was passing then he'd quit.\n\r\n\"But I'm still right here, givin' blood, keepin' faith and I'm still right here \"\r\nHe's still living the best he can, passing the test the best he knows how by continually finding new ways to open our minds, to teach us the things he's learned. He's still giving us his attention.\n\r\n\"Wait it out \r\nGonna wait it out \r\nGonna wait it out (Be patient) \"\r\nHe's sticking to his path, he's gunna continue to practice his chosen path because he still thinks its worth it. He still has hope for the ignorant.\n\r\n\"If there were no rewards to reap \r\nNo loving embrace to see me through\"\r\nThe rewards = monetary and social gain, the loving embrace = the love and admiration of his fans.\r\n\"This tedious path I've chosen here\"\r\nThe tedious path is the work he does, him teaching us.\r\n\"I certainly would've walked away \r\nBy now \"\r\nHe would have quit trying to lift people out of the gutters, or help them lift themselves out. If it wasn't for the good he could see coming out of it, he would have quit doing it.\n\r\nThis next part is where I decided that this song was specifically talking about Maynard's will to continue helping people as he is.\r\n\"If there were no desire to heal\r\nThe damaged and broken met along\"\r\nWe, his listeners, are the damaged and broken... He has a desire to heal us, to help us by helping us realize more of ourselves. This small difference from the previous version of this same paragraph points to us, points to his attempts to help us.\r\n\"This tedious path I've chosen here \r\nI certainly would've walked away \r\nBy now \"\r\nIf he didn't have a desire to heal us, he wouldn't be doing it.\n\r\n\"And I still may \"\r\nI do not like the implications of this line as seen through my interpretation. He's saying he still may quit his life's work, which is helping us... He may quit making music. I'm sure he will someday, I just don't like to hear him considering it yet. I'm sure I have a lot more to learn from him.\n\r\n\"Must keep reminding myself of this \r\nI must keep reminding myself of this \"\r\nI think this line comes from the times Maynard feels fed-up with the bad side of his career. He has to keep reminding himself of the rewards and the loving embraces.\n\r\nThe rest of the song re-iterates previous parts of the song in ways that time them together:\r\n\"If there were no rewards to reap (I must keep reminding myself of this)\"\n\r\nHe has to remind himself of each and every part of the whole to make an accurate decision to continue. \"I must keep reminding myself of this\" is repeated after every line of the paragraph sung earlier in the song. He's taking the time to recognize each reason each point of why he's doing what he does... This is where my meaning begins to come in.\n\r\nI see this song in a broader light, personally. When I listen to this song I think about the different situations in my life and all of the different factors that affect those situations. I try to look at every person, every feeling, every THING as a whole. I try to see every single part of what I'm thinking about so I can accurately judge how to interact with it.\n\r\nThis song reminds me to keep being vigilant, keep taking the entire picture into view before making decisions. It keeps me from being irrational, and makes me think rationally when I'm angry, or depressed. When I can't seem to focus on the right things... I listen to this and step back to take a larger look at the picture.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nthe song from my point of view is someone at the bottom of a horrible experience who isn't sure they want to live anymore. but then the person decides that there is still hope for a resolution for the better so they decide to \"wait it out\" not acting upon the situation but hoping that by sitting by time will heal the situation. The song does not end with a resolution.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_14": "\nfor those of you that want a real interpretation: C.S. Lewis wrote a book called the Screwtape Letters--a christian satire that is about a demon guiding a junior level demon on how to keep a man out of heaven. he (screwtape) tells the junior demon (wormwood) that the key to successfully taking a man is through boredom and confussion, rather than to get him to something entirely evil. (\"the safest path to hell is a gradual one\")\n\r\nwhat does this have to do with this song? the lyrics clearly show that the narrator is questioning his own faith and is continuously choosing this tedious path of some sort.\n\r\nso what's the main kicker in all of this? throughout the 'Screwtape Letters', the demons always refer to the man in question as...you guessed it...\"the patient\"\n\r\n...your welcome\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\nI've always thought that this song explores the definition of the word \"patient\" in more than one way. \n\r\nHe uses patient in the tense of a person or people waiting for something, anything really.\n\r\nBut, he also uses the tense of a person who is sick, or is at a hospital of some sort. \"But I'm still right here, givin' blood, keepin' faith and I'm still right here..\"\n\r\nThe saying, \"givin' blood\" could be taken literally, like the song is a story about a person who is donating blood and no one is noticing, or he's reaping no benefits, so the person is trying to be patient with his surroundings.\n\r\n\"If there were no desire to heal \r\nThe damaged and broken met along \r\nThis tedious path I've chosen here \r\nI certainly would've walked away \r\nBy now\"\n\r\nIn this paragraph, the \"damaged and broken\" are the sick people in need of blood, and he desires to heal them.\n\r\nJust a thought \n\n\n", "comment_16": "\nMy take on this song; is that it is about maturity!\r\nWhat makes this song so special is the atmosphere of enlightment and the confrontation of your own flaws (tedious path..), compared to much of Tools earlier work.

I can really connect to this song and I assure you that it have helped me keeping myself calm when I have wanted to explode.\n\r\nIt's about being the bigger man but in a humble way and not in a self righteous way. There are always people who will try to drain you, but it's up to you if you want to make a beef out of it, or turn the other way and wait it out.\n\r\n\"I must keep reminding myself of this\" is a mantra I will keep within me until I forget. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nVampires are a metaphor for evil/The-Devil/temptation.

But the other person is afraid, and is simply using that as an excuse \"paranoid, paralyzed vampire.\" He keeps reminding himself that there is a reason he is still here, the love and possibility of moving further \"if there were no reward...\" if it wasnt for that he would have surely moved on to someone else, and he still may, regretfully.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_22": "\nTo me this song represents a man losing his faith.

To go through the pains in life, the suffering, the torment, just knowing that the road you decided is true.  And though it may get you down, you can always ask yourself what Maynard has.  If it's too bad for you to go on, why not just walk away?  I ask myself that, and then the realization comes to me.  That there will come a time when you get everything you've wanted.\n\r\nThink about this.  For I have.  If I were to win the lottery and a million dollars tomorrow would I be happy.  Would you really be ready to go from being tight with your money to being able to buy everything in sight?  I myself would lose my ambition for hard work and making it to the top, because you were elevated to it from some random number.\n\r\nNo, I will work hard and when the things come to me that I want I will be surprised, but inside I will know that I had it long since coming.  \n\r\nA second part to this song is what I think is a message to all of you people who are religious.  Please don't feel ashamed for wanting to pray or follow your path of belief because you want to better you life.  I mean what are you trying to hide?  I have spent too much time feeling guilty for praying for finding a lover, for being successful, for just being happy.  No need to feel bad, as I don't think a person should be destined to live their life in suffering for their belief.  Unless they choose to.  I can't hide the fact I have followed my spiritual path to be healthier, happier, and to have my needs and wants satisfied.  It's all a part of accepting and loving yourself.  How can you love and accept God, without doing the same for yourself?\n\r\nIf there were no rewards to reap, no loving embrace to see me through, I certainly would have walked away.\n\r\nTo follow your belief, to breathe it, and to let it thrive in you.  It will make you a matyr.  You will have to work.  There are times you will be outcasted and have to suffer.  But I refuse to believe that this will be your entire life.  Because the light will rescue you when you have made the right choices.  And chose that inner path that you feel connected to.\n\r\nWhen I was taught my Merkaba meditation, I was told there were two kinds of people.  Service to self and service to others.  Service to self people are like vampires, they will leech onto you and try to suck your energy.  It's how they live.  Inside they are constantly draining away because they rely so much on others.  I've seen it.  One of my best friends is like that.  He will try to degrade you in front of others just to look better himself.  But people can always change.\n\r\nI know I'm the opposite.  I have an inner energy that keeps me going.  And I happily supply others with it.  But unfortunately, this draws in a lot of these \"vampires.\"  Be careful, and think about yourself before others.  Because you must maintain that balance within you before you can offer help to others.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_52": "\ni know that feeling.. i deal with people like that every day at school. sucks ass. i feel like one of very few in this damned hell that is a service to others. i was made a fool in elementary because of this. i'm like.. extremely open and nice and shit. x_x. people use me...but..i've tried to raise a shield to protect myself from that. people have \"leeched\" my energy to the point of suicidal intentions. but..the \"inner power\" of being patient and waiting it out is much stronger than whatever they could take from me. i won't let them do this to me. i am my own. and because i'm my own, people admire me now. =/. i had one friend say that she..well..saw me as a person who became something different, you know.. out of the stereotypes..stood up for what i believed..you know.. that kind of stuff. she looked up to me because i did that...i was kind of surprised when she told me that..cause..i didn't really expect it, truly. i just *try* to be what i can. i try to listen to MYSELF. \"..But our inner voices are yelling.

For me, I think of Pulp Fiction, Ezekial 25:17, The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities and tyranny of evil men. Blessed is He, who in the name of good will shephards the weak through the valley of darkness. For He is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children....I was raised with a strong Baptist background(my Grandfather was a preacher) and so was Maynard.

My \"religion\"- is all about how we have free  will and control over our own destinies. This comes with a lot of responsibility, but I also believe that we can choose to either make life a struggle or not. To make it interesting or not. We all have this potential within us, but so many choose to let external conditions rule our lives. This is the vampire. Sometimes it is tempting to forget this and feel like a victim, but I believe that we are truly free when we take responsibility for our own power. How can we heal or create if we are so busy being martyrs? This is for the small minded. Remaining small and meek and a victim does NOT help to advance the human race. But it is a difficult path. I keep thinking of Luke Skywalker... \n\r\nThis song is about temptation- when we are in despair, it is easy to think about walking away from it all. We know we have a higher purpose, but sometimes it just gets so exhausting. How many themes are there in movies and literature and myth about a reluctant messaiah? That's what we all are. They all face temptation- to walk away from their mission. It's a temptation we all face every day. Then you get strength from songs like Lateralus and Parabola...\n\r\nWe are all powerful beyond measure,  not in the small \"ego\" sense- but in the \"higher self\" sense, which we should all take the time to be guided by.

In my case this song is about being close to someone but they aren't ready to go further. Bordem has set in \"teduim\" because the narrorator wants to go beyond where they are. But the other person is afraid, and is simply using that as an excuse \"paranoid, paralyzed vampire.\" He keeps reminding himself that there is a reason he is still here, the love and possibility of moving further \"if there were no reward...\" if it wasnt for that he would have surely moved on to someone else, and he still may, regretfully.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_69": "\numm, okay, I like think that this song is about like patience.

Isn't this really the basis of life?  To be patient?  Sometimes it just feels like too much to bare ... always just waiting.  Perhaps it's just me, but I've never been anyone else so I don't know - but waiting is all that I've ever done.  And this song is really comforting.  Sometimes I forget that life has benefits, that there are things worth waiting for.  Sometimes I feel like I'm never going to get anywhere, like it's always the same - I'm just waiting and waiting forever (and HOW tedious).  Like, right now I am waiting and it feels almost impossible to take.  But I realize that I'm still here, that I'm waiting anyway.  It's not always so bad ... looking back the waiting has done...something...maybe very small, but something is all I need.

It's basically a person weighing the options: death being absolute, or death leading to something else, and the person is trying to keep faith, trying to convince himself there will be something better, something to look forward to, a future after death, because, otherwise, everything the person has lived for, everything he has suffered, every obstacle he has overcome, every time of happiness, has all been in vain if there is nothing after. The person thinks that, if there is no experience after death, then life is irrelevant, a insignificant fleeting dream with no ultimate direction.\n\r\nI think this is a decision or a belief that everyone must  make at some point in their life. Keep in mind, I'm absolutely certain Maynard isn't referring to religion. In fact, Maynard seems to stick well clear of it. I think the parabola that Maynard has explored in Lateralus is simply a very abstract concept of hope. It's definately spiritual, but it's not religious. \n\r\nIn this song, Maynard seems to rest on a point with his choice unmade. It seems as though he is almost despairing because, although this 'parabola' is a source of solace, he can't quite bring himself to believe it, or he is at least having doubts.\n\r\nAs for me, I'm an atheist and I think there isn't anything 'supernatural' beyond the end of life. However, in the end, aren't we all just stardust anyway? We are immortal. We will always be here, in one form or another. Whether we are conscious to experience it is irrelevant. We have our time to live, and when it is over, our ashes, our legacy, will become the foundation for the lives of others, the foundation of the universe in fact. So what's there to despair about?

It's a tedious path, that of a surgeon, whose craft often means life or death to the patient on their table. Were it not for the rewards of occasionally getting to witness the loving embraces of family members relieved to know their loved ones will be okay, this song suggests that perhaps the constant stream of death would be too much to bear, and a normal person would have walked away. This song, to me, means that the miracle of saving even one life makes up for the frustration of not being able to save 10 more, and that's the force that keeps a human being from giving up and walking away from such an unpredictable field such as treating terminal illness, where the odds, in most cases, are stacked against you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_155": "\nHere's what I think it's about, this is just me though, no offense to anyone else.\n\r\nI've always looked at this song as being about addiction, with such lines like \"You left me with no desire to heal\" and \"Wait it out\" having strong meanings. \"Giving blood\" could mean selling the essence of what keeps us alive for some other kind of gain, \"Vampires\" being a metaphor for the life we suck out of ourselves through addictions. The whole \"faith\" aspect is metaphorical as well, not so much religious, but personal, and dealing with rendering yourself free of all hazardous dependencies. The line \"No warming embrace to see me through\" sings volumes to me on a personal level. This song says a lot to me, and it really hits home when I look at myself and past addictions.  \"Is this a test? It has to be, otherwise I can't go on\" says so much about how damaging an addiction can be and your own personal limits being tested.

After all why would he be suffering for no reason it must be a test against his will. The patient is still there waiting and giving blood and having faith that he can make it through this and be rewarded. Possibly he feels better but the pain and depression and the thoughts of suicide are coming back but he must remind himself that he has gotten pass this test before and will surely be awarded and cannot give up yet for he has been on this path for a while now and will eventually come out. So he will wait it out to see if he can make it through this tedious path reaping the rewards having a loving embrace in the end.

If this is what the song is about, then it is saying not to waste your time helping someone or being with them through any type of healing/helping process if you are nont getting anything out of it... very unlikely, but its a thought\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_182": "\ni think this song is about his mother and longing for spiritual unification:\r\nhe fears to lose her but he believes that the pain is an illusion but he can't escape the situation and the only way, is to be patient(patient also resembles his mother) as the path of spiritual unification that he has chosen can only be achieved through patience.\n\r\nif he had known already that their is going to be no healing through this path he would have totally broken down a long time ago\n\r\nmother and spiritual unification have a common meaning as every mother loves her child and the unification with god is gaining that love again and being loved\n\r\nbut to go through this he has to be patient and not lose himself in emotions\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_183": "\ni think this song is about his mother and longing for spiritual unification:\r\nhe fears to lose her but he believes that the pain is an illusion but he can't escape the situation and the only way, is to be patient(patient also resembles his mother) as the path of spiritual unification that he has chosen can only be achieved through patience.\n\r\nif he had known already that their is going to be no healing through this path he would have totally broken down a long time ago\n\r\nmother and spiritual unification have a common meaning as every mother loves her child and the unification with god is gaining that love again and being loved\n\r\nbut to go through this he has to be patient and not lose himself in emotions\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_184": "\nI think a lot of the meanings here are better than mine, but when I really started to listen to this song I thought it was about procrastination.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_185": "\nTo me this song has always reminded me of relationships I've had, being committed to something but every now and then there would be a doubt in my mind, waiting for a change in the person to make the doubt go away.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_186": "\nEvery time I get blood work, I sing this song to myself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_187": "\nto me right now this song is about a long day in the office, finding meaning in that, and looking forward to the good things at the weekend!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_188": "\ni think this song is my favourit lyrics. anyone waiting for a big something like a change or whatever can relate to this song + the composition is awsome with rael progression and the drumbs are helerious as always\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_189": "\nI believe this song is about a relationship.

He is accordingly the doctor, or healer. He will be patient (wait it out) because he believes there will be a loving embrace at the end of it: explaining why he puts up with it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_190": "\nI recognized this song as young men being the vampire.  No more, but for a while I was. I have to say, I never physically abused my wife, but mentally, I did.  I made her take my shit, just to prove she loved me.  Reminds me of the Pink Floyd lyrics, \"I'd make her prove her love for me. I'd take all that I could take.  And I'd push her to the limit, just to see if she would break.\"  This song is about most young relationships, because I've seen so many like that.  I think of it as being sung from a young woman's point of view.  She is putting up with a young man.  If you didn't realize it yet, nobody is more emotional and insecure, and harder to deal with than a young man.  As usual TOOL is dealing with the realities of everyday life struggles.  \n\nYoung men, especially those who weren't raised in the best manner, are scarred to a degree (but aren't we all), and struggling to become what they think is a strong man.  Because of that, they are abusive and controlling to their young girlfriends or wives.  And God knows why, way more often than not, the young women take it.  They see inside of the want-to-be-tough guy, and see that he is hurting, and his abuse is a symptom of his pain, and they are going to heal him.   Because God knows after he abuses her, he's going to be Mr. nice guy again and give her that loving embrace to see her through. \n\nEvery now and then they just get sick of the same old cycle and a groan of tedium escapes them....startling the fearful.  The fearful would of course be the young man himself, or his family who hopes that the good woman is going to stick by him and help him dig out of his pathetic existence, make a civilized human being out of him, and of course lighten their burden from him.  Maybe even a judge who sees that he has a chance because he has a good woman who may straighten him out. \n\nEven though she's tired of it all, what does she say after her groans....I'm going to wait it out.  But then she may walk away....and she still may.  But she keeps taking it because this sick man who needs her help is her.....Patient.  Blood sucking bastard.  Grow up and start giving back what you've taken.  Treat her like she deserves.  We all see you for what you are.  A weak little boy trying to pretend to be a man,  who is more emo than a teenage girl.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_191": "\nI can somehow relate to the lyrics and to comments people provide. I currently attend college of medicine in my home town. My country just got into EU so the education system changed. I've chosen this college to learn and help people but it is still not happening. All that's happening is mostly just mindless learning things I will never require in my life again. I feel so unsatisfied with that, like it all is meaningless. It drains my patience and sometimes destroys my social life. But I'm still doing my best, trying to pass all the tests on time because I believe that one day it will all fall into place and make sense. Keeping faith, giving blood... for the patients in the future.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_192": "\nthis is sung from the perspective of someone who's gnostically convictional about knowing the purpose of both life and death, and being tempted to skip to the latter, as the former seems tedious at this point (especially in light of what death really \"means\")\n\nkeenan is more often than not having a dialogue with himself, not others.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_193": "\nThe prior post says that this is a song about somebody contemplating suicide.  That poster also states that Maynard more often speaks to himself than others.  I couldn't disagree more on either account.\n\nOther songs have clearly noted Maynard's disdain for suicide.  He wouldn't write this song, as a sympathetic understanding for the desire.  See Outsider - A Perfect Circle, among others.  \"Suicidal Imbecile\", \"Narcissistic Drama Queen\".  These are not words of sympathy for those contemplating leaving.  But this song does give sympathy to the one being tested.  And the Patient is somebody else - the vampire.  The poster has totally ignored the fact that there are two subjects in this song as he wants it to be about suicide.  I can only guess why he wants that to be the meaning.  Perhaps he's one of the young men I speak of in my original post....\n\nAnd to the second point.  Maynard has told us they are trying to be our TOOL, to help us through this life.  What kind of a TOOL would they be if they didn't speak to us, and just spoke mainly to themselves?  I'm sorry for you that you haven't yet understood the band or it's songs, but yet don't realize your blindness.  Keep working.  That's what life is about.  Nobody finds enlightenment without work and reconsideration of all things.  If TOOL gives you some meaning you can hang on to and find value in, great.  Keep listening.  Perhaps you will find what Maynard has, some peace in this world through all of the ugliness he has had to express.  He has admitted he has healed some and though this may mean a demise to TOOL we should be grateful, as this means there may be some hope for the rest of us.  Sounds like you need it.

We have the decision to take our life away because it's easy, but there is better days and a chance to be better as a whole. By being patient, good things will come. I believe the instrumentals play a huge role in this song, they match with the lyrics so well.

Then she breathes deeply and decides to keep being patient for her patient.\n\nI think the only reason so many don't see it as the tired, frustrated woman is, most of the people who listen to this are the emotional males, who are so self-absorbed they can't see it being about her, they see it about themselves instead, and all that THEY are going through.  Of course.  It just goes to prove my points.  Keep listening and let them be a TOOL for your growth.  \n\nThe recurrent theme in most TOOL songs is a soul sucking frustration from dealing with the shit hole of a world we live in due to the self absorbed assholes.  When that's how you feel, like I do, you hate them with every fiber.  When you hate them that much, you start to look at yourself and try to make sure you are not one of them.  That self-analyzation, leads to awareness, leads to empathy, leads to growth.  Keep listening.  As you age, experience, and reanalyze, you will see it differently, not just as your own self-centered drama.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_196": "\nVery simply put this is about patience. Its clear as day. Essentially he is addressing the tedious and repetitive path one takes, one that may be necessary, to being with the one they truly wish to be with. Along the way time is shared with those who use the patient person. Leaches, emotional vampires, users. Its part of the journey and almost everyone goes through this. \n\nThey remain optimistic in the idea they will find that one, or finally be with the one they know is meant for them. Relying on the idea that in the end there will be a loving embrace, the love of that one, is seeing them through all the hardship along the way.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_197": "\nYou know, maybe Maynard is human after all.
