And people that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, because eventually they get back what they've dished out.\n\r\nThat's a clear reference when he talks about pissing on the black kettle.

I see this as a general middle finger to hypocritical demagogues, who do wrong to others for their own gain by hiding behind their perceived authority. That's self-evident to anyone who's heard the saying \"that's the pot calling the kettle black,\" if you add that with a few other references in the song.\n\r\nSpecifically, Keenan did mention marijuana prohibition as inspiring the lyrics, but he did say it's about hypocrisy in general but could apply to many things. In any interview I've heard with him, he seems to play his cards pretty close in revealing meanings of his songs. He's not the type to get on his \"soap box\" to ram something down people's throats, and wants people to think for themselves instead.\n\r\nKeenan has reportedly spoken publicly that he thinks the U.S. government was involved in 9/11. At a concert, which had been scheduled the day of 9/11 and rescheduled a few days after, the crowd was chanting \"USA, USA!\" when he said a few words about the victims. When they chanted, he reportedly said something like \"You all are going to really be bummed out when you find out we did this to ourselves.\"\n\r\nIf you apply the lyrics to that situation, they fit as well as marijuana prohibition. \"Who are you to point your finger\" (Patriot Act, Real ID, TSA screenings, domestic spying, police state), as an example. \"Kangaroo done hung the jury\" (like a rigged \"kangaroo court,\" the Patriot Act didn't examine all evidence purposely and many feel it let the guilty go. \"He's as guilty as the government\" (many people realize bin Laden was formerly funded by the CIA, and see more evidence of complicity in 9/11 when they look at the government than they do bin Laden) The examples can go on.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nSo, I decided to avoid doing a paper on Tim O'Brien and instead wanted to try my hands at cracking this one. Though not one of Maynord's deepest recordings, it contains some pretty interesting symbolism, along with a convoluted meaning, and no I didn't edit this or make all fluid and \"smart\" like- I just took it line by line and study the etymology behind this, which should still be pretty decent. If you don't care to see the break up,  just skip to the last paragraph. \n\r\nSo first verse... This verse is extremely accusatory. He says who are you to judge me when you don't see what's going on \"eye hole deep in muddy water\". You talk so highly about yourself, that you assume a Godly status \"raise the dead\". \"Rob the grave to snow the cradle then burn the evidence down\" These lines boldly describe a desperate and loathsome individual, but who? To Snow actually refers to over compliment someone and over flattery in order to take advantage of them, it can also refer to cocaine, but you wouldn't coke a cradle, unless you are creating an environment of delusion.So taking this into consideration, you steal from the dead, and lie to the innocent to get what you want, and then you hide your actions. The rest is a given a \"House of Cards\", a House of \"Glass\"..these things are fragile, this is in reference to New Testament ideology, he who lives without sin... I bring this up because the album as a whole has a very religious awakening theme throughout.\n\r\nSecond V: The speaker accuses the recipient of being delusional and so full of shit, he then makes fun of them. In this line there also seems to be a change in direction towards the audience. \"It must be difficult to dance this one, til you pull it out.\" This statement, says you, the listener can't fully understand the meaning of this song, til you get your head out of your ass. \"Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference\" You are relentless in your actions in order to support your belief. \"kangaroo done hung the jury with the innocent\" A kangaroo court doesn't always refer to an actual jury. It also applies to legal matters in general, such as legal misleading, it carries the theme of the dishonest individual. When we take the two lines as a whole we see a legal authority who is hell bent on getting there way. \n\r\n\"now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo. (musta) got lemon juice up in your eye when you pissed all over my black kettle.\" Cozened, to win over someone by ways of deceit. Indigo- Historically one of the most important colors. Indigo was mandated to be worn only by authoritative figures. It also has another meaning in classic literature it often refers to the deepest sorrow, or an overwhelming depression. The Black kettle, ques into the Title, The pot calling the kettle black. Meaning: Your criticism of me and my belief, are blinding you and causing you harm.\"You musta been high\"- Delusional. \n\r\n\"who are you to wave your finger? so full of it\". How dare you judge me, us! \"Eye balls deep in muddy waters. fuckin hypocrite\". You actions disallow you from judgment \"liar, lawyer, mirror show me. what's the difference?\"  Our political system is full of lies, and lawyers are liars. \"Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent.\" Our judicial system is corrupted and malfunctioning. \"Kangaroo be stoned. he's guilty as the government.\" now we get the juxtaposing kangaroo, Kangaroo meaning someone dumb... it was first believed that Kangaroo meant \"I don't know\". So kangaroo be stoned either this idiot is high, or this idiot is being judged. He's as guilty as the government meaning that he is to blame for his actions as much as the government who created the laws against him.  \n\r\nGanja, please. Ganja, only means pot, it has no other meaning. Ganja, please.. please as in whatever, you must have been outta of your mind. The juxtaposition again either, it is the you, the listener, are crazy to think that this song is about pot. Or it is How dare you think that it is correct to destroy someone's life over something so dumb.\n\r\nI think this a criticism towards the current judicial persecution with the example of marijuana users persecution. It's main message though is to the listener that this is not a Pro-Pot song, it is a pro-activism song, because he is saying that the reasons that our government is so out of control, is because \"we\" the listeners are high, and we have allowed them to get this power. We have allowed them to blind us. Eye ball deep in muddy war in this context is us the listener, the baby in the cradle, the innocent. He is trying to get us accept responsibility, get our heads out of our ass and to actually do something.   \n\n\n\n", "comment_4": "\nWow, some of the interpretations are quite... interesting.\n\r\nA couple of things to note... this song is multi-layered, but the most obvious theme here is satire. Tool is playing on words right from the title!\n\r\nThe song is called The Pot, referring both to marijuana and the dirty pot looking at its own reflection.\n\r\nPeople seem to be really confused by robbing a grave to snow the cradle, the muddy waters, lemon juice and weeping shades of indigo. \n\r\nRobbing a grave to snow the cradle: Drug meaning: Doing DMT.  Hypocrisy meaning: Possibly using the deceased to pad election votes into a win.\n\r\nEye ball deep in Muddy Waters + Lemon juice in your eye: Drug meaning: An alcoholic drink containing lemon juice. Hypocrisy meaning: Being blinded by drunkenness and making a poor decision making the decision maker as guilty as whomever he is accusing of wrong-doing.\n\r\nWeeping shades of indigo: Drug meaning: Having purple tears is an idiom for someone who is high. Hypocrisy meaning: Shakespeare referenced \"purple tears\" in more than one of his plays, which was actually not talking about crying at all, but rather bleeding and dying, and in all the times I'm aware of, the protagonist had slain an enemy and referred to his blood-loss leading to death as crying/shedding purple tears. Cozened basically means \"coaxed by deceit\". Of course, this blood would not be literal, so the bleeding hypocrite is up for interpretation.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nTrexor,\n\r\nIf you go back and read my post, you might get some insight as to what we are talking about here.  The song is about hypocrisy, not marijuana.  Marijuana was just a vehicle or literary device for Maynard to talk about people committing atrocities and hiding behind laws or positions of power.  Diverting our attention from their wrong doings by waving fingers and keeping the looking glass pointed the other way, and policing us.\r\nDo yourself a favor and read up Kangaroo courts and what is happening in Guantanamo Bay, or find out who Black Kettle is and what happened to him.  Why was he killed?  Think about how that might relate to what is happening right now in the world.  How that might relate to the US war in Iraq.\n\r\nI know this stuff is tough for a 19 year old such as yourself to digest, and may include a sort of textual analysis you are not familiar with, but please stop spamming the TooL boards.

Conditioning almost, for the innumerable times the government has tried, and will try, to lie and hide what it has done to protect those who have committed said atrocities. \n\r\n\"Soapbox house of cards and glass so\r\nDon't go tossin' your stones around\" -  'He had a voice that was strong and loud' Eulogy. A proud and seemingly unshakeable foundation to preach what is right and wrong. When in fact, everything hinges on a cornerstone, deceit, as long as the general public is fed with distractions, the need to to speedy remedies to government loopholes and general stupidity will be almost non-existent. \r\nDon't go tossin' your stones around is simply a warning, to the government to tread softly.  \n\r\n\"You must have been high\" - No relation to actual drug doing, it's saying that what you're doing is so crazy, outlandish, and/or stupid that you must be under the influence. Like Trexor, saying Tool sucks.\n\r\n\"Foot in mouth and head up ass\r\nSo whatcha talkin' 'bout?\r\nDifficult to dance 'round this one\r\n'til you pull it out. boy,\" - snowball effect. Nothing will truly be gained or accomplished until the trend of sweeping it under the carpet, the lies and evasions are stopped.\n\r\n\"Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference\r\nKangaroo done hung the jury with the innocent\" - I do not know much on the Guantanimo or Gitmo cases, but it seems very apparent that the ability to adjudicate someone without the evidence is the subject. \r\nCorruption follows the trickle-down principle to, it fits, the broader subject of government taking away mans 'unalienable' rights may not hurt him physically, or immediately, but good men do suffer seems to be the best fit.\n\r\n\"Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo\r\n(Musta) got lemon juice up in your eye\r\nWhen you pissed all over my black kettle.\" - Cozen: verb, to trick or deceive. I Interpret this as the government is trying to cover up itself by lying, and destroying the evidence, but now we've caught on. We see through the shroud. Apparently Black Kettle is a specific person or case. The entire song has wording which has a 'We're on to you' voice to it. Almost like Fight Club, more specifically, Brad Pitt's lines \"We've grown up being told we're going to be famous movie stars, Astronauts, and rock stars; but we're not, and we're slowly learning that right boys, and we are pissed.\"\n\r\n\"Kangaroo be stoned.

You must have been outta your head\" -> Refers to the \"pot calling the kettle black\", but also to being stoned, \"outta your head\".\n\r\n\"Eye hole deep in muddy waters You practically raised the dead\" -> Not too sure, but seems to be an allusion to war, oil, disaster, etc.\n\r\n\"Rob the grave to snow the cradle Then burn the evidence down\" -> Do something illegal/morally questionable, but then hide all the evidence (common in corrupt governments). Also, \"burn the evidence\", though I've never heard it used as such, could also be taken to mean smoking marijuana.\n\r\n\"Soapbox house of cards and glass so Don't go tossin' your stones around\" -> Refers both to a \"house of cards\", a fragile structure that can come tumbling down in a moments notice, and the addige \"those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones\". Again, also a reference to \"stoned\", or being stoned, which turns up a lot.\n\r\n\"You must have been high\r\nYou must have been high\r\nYou must have been...\" -> Obvious reference to marijuana intoxication, but also to \"being on one's high horse\".\n\r\n\"Foot in mouth and head up ass-hole Whatcha talkin' 'bout?\" -> \"Foot in mouth\" means to shut up.\n\r\n\"Difficult to dance 'round this one 'til you pull it out, boy\" -> Prosecution of marijuana is a difficult dance because so many damn people use it, also corruption is hard to dance around.\n\r\n\"Steal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference\" -> Talking about corruption again, refers to \"refer\", i.e. marijuana again, and \"shady inference\" means \"shady implications\", akin to lying about a political opponent or simply scare-tactics.\n\r\n\"Kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent\" -> Kangaroo referring of course to a \"kangaroo court\", \"hung the juror with the innocent\" i.e. blamed him for doing what's right, not what the party line is, because he defended the \"innocent\" (i.e. drug users, who hurt no one but themselves).\n\r\n\"Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo\r\nGot lemon juice up in your eye\r\nWhen you pissed all over my black kettle\" -> I heard someone say \"weeping indigo\" could mean blood, i.e. deaths from the hypocricy and war, \"lemon juice in the eye\" refers to kicking dirt or lies at someone, while \"black kettle\" again references \"the pot calling the kettle black\".\n\r\n\"Who are you to wave your finger? \r\nSo full of it \r\nEye balls deep in muddy waters\r\nFuckin' hypocrite\" -> A variation on the first stanza, only more angry and outright. Last line sums it up.\n\r\n\"Liar, lawyer; mirror show me, what's the difference?\" -> Lawyers are usually thought to be lying fraudsters.\n\r\n\"Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent\" -> Almost the same as above, only I don't know what implications changing \"innocent\" to \"guilty\" has to the meaning.\n\r\n\"Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo\r\nGot lemon juice up in your eye, eye\r\nWhen you pissed all over my black kettle\r\nYou must've been...\" -> Repeat of above.\n\r\n\"So who are you to wave your finger?\r\nWho are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?\r\nYou must have been out your mind\" -> Starts off the same as the first stanza again, only \"fatty fingers\" refers to politicians, the \"grubby little piggies\" with their hands in everything!\n\r\n\"Liar, lawyer; mirror for ya', what's the difference?\" -> Same line of as above.\n\r\n\"Kangaroo be stoned. He's guilty as the government\" -> A command to fight the kangaroo courts who are as guilty of hypocrisy and corruption as the government proper.\n\r\n\"Eyeballs deep in muddy waters\r\nYour balls deep in muddy waters\r\nGanja POLICE*\r\nYou must have been out your mind\" -> First things first, I'm 95% sure it should be \"Ganja police\" not \"Ganja please\". Ganja police referring to those who wish to keep marijuana down and illegal, i.e. War on Drugs.

I believe the title is a double entendre which includes both marijuana and the old idiom about The Pot calling The Kettle black, which is generally understood to imply hypocrisy.   I believe the line saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cpissed all over my black kettle\u00e2\u0080\u009d is just a cool way of saying \u00e2\u0080\u009ccriticized me\u00e2\u0080\u009d.   I think the song is about pot, laws, political machinations and the hypocrisy of those in power to judge others.   And like the beauty of nuance in other classical music composition, you can infer many other threads of meaning woven in.  With all the metaphors we have to imply hypocrisy, Tool chose to highlight the pot and kettle.  Now look at the lines in the 1904 book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaxwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Elementary Grammar\u00e2\u0080\u009d:   \u00e2\u0080\u009cOho!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the pot to the kettle; You are dirty and ugly and black!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Tool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lyrics conjure images of racist fingers pointing at all the black men this country jails for marijuana offenses.

I read a theory about \u00e2\u0080\u009ccozened indigo\u00e2\u0080\u009d I like on this page toolnavy.com/\u2026 that links religion and deceit. Psychic aura color interpretation says Indigo \u00e2\u0080\u009crelates to the third eye\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Dark or Muddy blue indicates \u00e2\u0080\u009cfear of future and facing the truth\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Draw your own conclusions.  Politicians who rub lemon juice into their eyes to make them water have false, mechanical sympathy . It reminds me of the saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cspare me your crocodile tears.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Crocodiles cry, not because they feel sorry for their victims, but because their jaw is so close to their eyes that the pressure of chewing makes their eyes water.

The title is in reference to marijuana, and the phrase \"The pot calling the kettle black\". The kangaroo is symbolic of the judicial system. \r\n\"You musta been high...\" is a sarcastic remark for the ridiculous claims that the government and especially, the judicial system make. \n\r\nAlcohol is legal, and look how many people have died as a result of it's use, abuse, and driving under the influence of it. \r\nHow many people do you know of that have died in a marijuana-related accident?\r\nWhen people get stoned, all they want to do is sit on their couch, eat, and laugh at really stupid jokes and tv shows that normally wouldn't be funny. \r\nWhen people get drunk, they're defensive, obscene, rude, loud, emotional or angry, and can be very violent. They tend to want to beat the shit out of everything that walks past them, and driving doesn't seem so difficult. \r\nSome pot-smokers, such as myself, use it as a means of perception, and a way to get a new perspective on topics, or to help ease writer's block.\r\nIt helps me write better, and it helps me paint better. When I'm stoned and have conversations about very big issues, I tend to understand things on a different level, and perceive things from a different perspective.

Put some fucking THOUGHT into your posts, idiots. The song is about hypocracy. In an interview, Adam Jones said himself that the line, \"Who are you to wave your finger?\" is in reference to \"the pot calling the kettle black\". Tool purposely lined the lyrics with apparent drug references to hide the true meaning of the song from those who are shallow enough to think it truely is about drugs.\n\r\nHere...let me break it down for those of you whose IQ's seem to be equivalent to that of a tick.\n\r\n\"Who are you to wave your finger? / You must have been out 'your head\" = He's calling the person a hypocrite, saying that he must have been mad to think that he was any better than anyone else.\n\r\n\"Eyehole deep in muddy waters / You practically raise the dead\" = The hypocrite is up to his eyes in trouble, so to speak, with his act of greatness. Yet he continues to act high-and-mighty as if he's better than everyone else. \"You practically raise the dead\" is a metaphor for the hypocrite acting as if he's on par with God.\n\r\n\"Rob the grave to snow the cradle / Then burn the evidence down\" = The hypocrite performs immoral acts and profits from them. \"Snow the cradle\" could be considered a metaphor for \"showering one's home in riches.\" This shows that the hypocrite has gained his self-proclaimed \"greatness\" (i.e. wealth) through improper means. The hypocrite then proceeds to attempt to cover up his doings.\n\r\n\"Soapbox house of cards and glass\" = The hypocrite preaches as if he knows better than they, yet the base on which his points rest is as sturdy as a house of cards. It's easily shattered, like glass.\n\r\n\"So don't go tossin' your stones around\" = This is another common statement about hypocrites altered into Keenan's own words: \"Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.\"\n\r\n\"You must've been high\" = The hypocrite must've been really high on himself to actually think he was better than anyone else.\n\r\n\"Foot in mouth and head up ass / So what\u00e2\u0080\u0099chu talkin' 'bout?\" = Again calling the person a hypocrite, this time two times in succsession, and in different words each time. \"God your foot in your mouth\" and \"God your head up your ass\".\n\r\n\"Difficult to dance \u00e2\u0080\u0098round this one / \u00e2\u0080\u0098Til you pull it out, boy\" = A bit hard to show someone how hypocritical he is unless he pulls his foot out of his mouth or his head from his ass, isn't it?\n\r\n\"Steal, borrow, reaper, savior / Shady inference\" = The difference between right and wrong is presented here; opposite sides of the spectrum, if you will. Sealing is to reaper as borrow is to savior. The hypocrite has been stealing, as evidenced in the earlier lyric, \"Rob the grave to snow the cradle\".\n\r\n\"Kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent\" = This applies to the term \"kangaroo court,\" in reference to shady and improper trial proceedings. Here, it's telling the hypocrite that his ways are like that of a kangaroo court: shady and improper (i.e. stealing).\n\r\n\"Now you're weepin' shades of chosen indigo / Got lemon juice up in your eye / When you pissed all over my black kettle\" = The metaphor of the hypocrite urinating on the other's kettle is used to describe the hypocrite disregarding what the others say against him as unimportant garbage. Similar to peeling/squeezing a lemon and it squirting its stinging juice into his eye, his urine (i.e. his downtalking of what the others warned him of: the warnings they gave him of the consequences for becoming too prideful) has splashed back up off the kettle into his eye, stinging. He now realizes what he's been doing was wrong and breaks into tears, regretting his immoral deeds. This is metaphorically explained with the line, \"Now you're weepin' chosen shades of indigo\" in that he chose this path, yet is now crying in regret over it. He chose his own fate, his own tears, if you will.\n\r\n\"So full of it\" = Referring to when he was being prideful and holier-than-thou: his statements proved he was full of shit with his almost Godlike claims of being so great.\n\r\n\"Fuckin' hypocrite\" = Check and mate. This line fully proves my theory.\n\r\n\"Liar, lawyer\" = This further ties into the earlier line referencing the term \"kangaroo court\".\n\r\n\"Mirror, show me what's the difference?\" = Reference to Snow White and the queen's magic mirror. The queen would request the mirror to show her who the greatest one of all was. Here, the person is saying that all are equal: no one is better than any other.\n\r\n\"Weeping shades of indigo / Shed without a reason\" = The people still don't know how he became so wealthy and prideful; they know not of his wrongdoings or what he's crying over. He is crying over those wrongdoings, yet they do not know that. They cannot figure out the reason for his tears.\n\r\n\"Mirror, for you what's the difference?\" = A mirror has no sense of preference or bias; it simply shows what's put in front of it. It knows not what ego, stature, position, or power are; it shows anyone, no matter what part they play in society. This can be seen as the basic idea of all being equal. All are simply human.\n\r\n\"Kangaroo be stoned / He's guilty as the government\" = The hypocrite has been sentenced to death by stoning by the government, which is hypocritical in and of itself.The government is just as guilty as the \"kangaroo courts\" themselves for allowing them to happen, for not having a way of stopping them from happening.\n\r\n\"Eyeballs deep in bloody waters\" = His own blood has been shed from all the trouble he's built upon himself.\n\r\n\"Ganja police, you must've been out 'your mind\" = Ganja is a slang term for cannabis, the plant form of marijuana. Similar to the government not having a surefire way of preventing kangaroo courts, police trying to uphold the anti-marijuana laws really can't do anything to stop the drug from getting around and being used, no matter how hard they'd like to try.

He sure did but he must have been so high!!! \uf04a I have nothing against pot and I personally believe that everybody has to get high in this world we live in, but not everyday, not without a good reason and not with chemical shit that can kill your ass!!! Getting high goes way back in the days and I'm not going to analyze that. If you are interested read some ancient history. Also as someone else said, many of the greatest song composers were probably high when they wrote those hits!! At Download 2006, Maynard whispered a little something about G.W.

You have a very nice country, which your ancestors created with a lot of hard work but it's currently controlled by the wrong people!!  I come from Greece but I used to live in U.S.A. for some time a couple years ago and I now leave in England.

Tool tried to share some thoughts about his image in the past aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they?? But as many of you said, goes to all hypocrites who have the daring to support laws so as to send people to jail for stupid reasons (like smoking some pot) while they commit much worst crimes that they easily get away for.\r\n{Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent}\r\n{Rob the grave to snow the cradle and burn the evidence down}\r\nNot only that they have the nerve to force the rest of the world to support those laws.\r\n{Who are you to wave your finger?}{Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go tossing' your stones all 'round}\r\n{Ganja Polease(Please+Police).

It is calculated yes, but as a whole, it is very subjective to the listener. I think thats what good art does. That doesnt mean that you can just write some shitty poem that doesnt have a meaning simply because some idiots will overanalyze it enough to give it meaning. But it does mean that song lyrics are designed with less literal structure than prose, to match the music, and allow for some listener thought and interaction. I think that is the point of good art. A lot of you have mentioned general hypocracy as the meaning of the song and I agree to an extent. But as a musician, sometimes simplicity just makes for better music, and this group of 40 year olds is not going to throw away a good song just because it is not \"deep enough\". So, it very well could be about some current issue like Katrina, or it could just be about weed (and so what if it is a simple weed debate song). I also think that the mind is an extremely powerful thing, so dont be so sure that you heard \"hair instead of head\". I for one have been convinced of a lyric, but when the actual words were published by the artist later, my mind convinced me of the contrary. The last thing that I wanted to say was regarding Tool's \"trickery\". I think that they obviously like to have fun with idiot interviewers and fans making claims of decoy albums, but I dont think that they want to decieve everyone just for the fun of it. They are in a very strange position as a heavy metal band. They are very popular across the world, but their image and music seems to be very natural and unique. In a recent interview, they said that they \"were the band that slipped through the cracks\". I think that pretty much sums it up. There is a good chance that right now, if Tool were to be a new band coming out in 2006, without showing themselves in videos or having the sound that they do, they would not make it at all. So lets just be thankful that they exist on as grand a scale as they do without selling out. If you dont like the music that is one thing. But dont say that 10000 days is a shitty album just to avoid being labeled a blind Tool follower. In my opinion, most Tool fans that I have met are intelligent human beings, so we should be proud of that.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_165": "\nlady, limerence, lost, and introspection... a high tint yet pungeant.    ohh how ive dreampt of taps ....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_166": "\ntee hee hee grey globs and silver slobs\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_167": "\nHe's singing about politics, to people such as Bush and Cheney.

The indigo child thing is more like a reaction to the drugging of kids for ADD, and I don't think it has much to do with the song, although it could relate to drugging kids to conform to society but saying other drugs are bad, but I digress.\n\n\r\nnow you're weeping shades of cozened indigo. (musta) got lemon juice\r\nup in your eye\n\r\nOk, so cozened deals with deceipt, so it's talking about false tears.  False tears of what?\n\r\nIndigo.  Now, indigo is, in fact, a color, as it has been associated with certain wavelengths in the visible spectrum, but most humans can't see it.  The significance of this word though is in the etymology.\n\r\nNow some of you have brought up lachrymology, the study of tears, and the funny thing is that some people think that it's not literal tears, but \"tears\" from the pineal gland, the \"indigo chakra.\"  Many people don't know why the pineal gland is known as the indigo chakra, but it's quite simple.  \n\r\nAlso, this album has a lot of references to drugs and Albert Hoffman, who first synthesized LSD, and discovered other endeogens like salvinorin a and psilocybin.  He also discovered DMT, which is thought to be produced in the Pineal Gland in small doses during near-death experiences and highly traumatic events.  This is not proven, however melatonin IS produced in the pineal gland.  Interestingly, what most of these drugs, except of Salvia, share is a basic chemical structure known as an indole.  So what DMT and melatonin share is the indole aromatic ring, and they both also share other similar structures (if you compare the two, melatonin is almost exactly the same as DMT, only melatonin has a few more oxygen and hydrogen atoms).  DMT is seen as an enlightening drug, and so the pineal/indigo chakra is seen as one of intelligence and enlightenment.  The word indole itself is derived from combining the words indigo and oleum, since indole was first isolated by treatment of the indigo dye with oleum.  So that's how the word indigo came to be used with the pineal gland and intelligence/enlightenment.\n\r\nnow you're weeping shades of cozened indigo. (musta) got lemon juice\r\nup in your eye\n\r\nso \"you\" are \"weeping\" \"tears\" of \"false/fake\" \"intelligence/enlightenment.\"  The person uses \"lemon juice\" to produce these tears.\n\r\nThat's pretty much all I got.  Don't want to get too much into the actual meaning of the song, because most of the people are too subjective, but I thought the indole thing would shed some light onto the meaning of the phrase.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_230": "\n\"The Pot\"\n\r\nWho are you to wave your finger?\r\nYa' must have been out your head.\r\nEye hole deep in muddy waters.\r\nYou practically raised the dead.\n\r\nRob the grave, to snow the cradle.\r\nThen burn the evidence down.\r\nSoapbox, house of cards, and glass,\r\nSo don't go tossin' your stones around.\n\r\nYou must have been high.\r\nYou must have been high.\r\nYou must have been.\n\r\nFoot in mouth, and head up asshole.\r\nWhatcha talkin' 'bout?\r\nDifficult to dance 'round this one\r\n'til you pull it out, boy!\n\r\nYou must have been, so high.\r\nYou must have been, so high.\n\r\nSteal, borrow, refer, save your shady inference.\r\nkangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent.\n\r\nNow you're weeping shades of cozened indigo\r\nGot lemon juice up in your...EYE!\n\r\nWhen you pissed all over my black kettle\r\nYou must have been HIGH, HIGH\r\nYou must have been HIGH, HIGH\n\r\nWho are you to wave your finger?\r\nSo full of it.\r\nEyeballs deep in muddy waters\r\nFuckin' hypocrite.\n\r\nLiar, lawyer, mirror, show me.\r\nWhat's the difference?\n\r\nkangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent.\n\r\nNOW!!\r\nYou'll weep or, change the cozened indigo.\r\nGot lemon juice up in your high eye.\r\nWhen you pissed all over my black kettle\r\nYou musta been!\n\r\nSo who are you to wave your finger?\r\nWho are you to wave your fatty finger at me?\r\nYou must, have been, out your, mind!\n\r\nWeepin' shades of indigo\r\nShed without a reason\r\nWeepin' shades of indigo\n\r\nLiar, lawyer,\r\nMirror for ya,\r\nWhat's the difference?\r\nkangaroo be stoned\r\nHe's guilty as the government\n\r\nNOW!!\r\nWill you weep or, change the cozened indigo\r\nGot lemon juice up in your, EYE!!\r\nEYE!!\n\r\nNow when you pissed all over my black kettle.\r\nYou musta been HIGH, HIGH, HIGH, HIGH.\r\nEyeballs deep in muddy waters\r\nYour balls deep in muddy waters.\r\nGanja, please, you must have been out your MIND!!!!\n\r\n[\"Kangaroo\" refers to \"kangaroo courts\", which were mock courts established to prove people guilty without a fair trial or any real evidence - most of the court cases dealt with marijuana users]\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_231": "\nIndigo, or purple is also the colour of royalty.

In the song, he basically says that he is a hypocrite for saying his mother threw away her life, because he threw away his by doing drugs. 'Who are you to wave your finger'. \n\r\nAlso, being for those who think that Tool is shallow, did anyone notice that if you play Wings part 1 and Viginti Tres back to back, while playing Wings part 2, it makes a....super song?

It's like an alchemical riddle (pun intended) - you can't solve it by analyzing a verse and forcing a meaning on whole song, which is what many users on this forum do, doing disservice to Maynard at the same time. Unlike them, Maynard KNOWS what he's talkin 'bout - there is nothing superficial or random in this song, it has a definite meaning.\n\r\nIt IS about hypocrisy, but he's is not just randomly attacking all hypocrytes in the world, but rather specific ones, and for very specific (and very serious) reason. \n\r\nEvery verse is just a peace of puzzle, which means you must find an interpretation that satisfies ALL of them. \n\r\nDon't just random guess - you have Google, do your research. \n\r\nHints on song's meaning that many posters ignore:\n\r\n>Rob the grave, to snow the cradle.\r\n>Then burn the evidence down.\n\r\nWho is robbing whose grave? Which cradle we are talking about? What evidence is being burned?\n\r\n>Soapbox, house of cards, and glass,\r\n>So don't go tossin' your stones around.\n\r\nWHO is preaching from the soapbox? WHY Maynard says preacher's house is \"of cards and glass\" (can be easily shattered)? \n\r\n>Difficult to dance 'round this one\r\n>'til you pull it out, boy!\n\r\nMaynard has caught the one he is adressing in this song in a trap, that he will not easily get out from.\r\nWhat he will will not be able to \"dance around\" this time? Why?\n\r\n>kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent.\n\r\nSong's title is \"The Pot\" (marijuana), cangaroo is linked to the juror - this is definitely about \"kangaroo courts\", which have to do with marijuana users and war on drugs, but it is not ONLY about that - goes much further. \"Robbing the grave to snow the cradle and burning the evidence down\" is not there without a reason, \"house of cards and glass\" also.\n\r\n>Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo\r\n>Got lemon juice up in your...EYE!\n\r\nDouble meaning. Yes, lemon juice is used to make false tears (hypocrisy), which fits nicely into theme, but it also has another, more important meaning, hinted at in the next verse, that has EVERYTHING to do with the theme of the song.\n\r\n>When you pissed all over my black kettle\n\r\n\"black kettle\" obviously has to do with phrase \"the pot calling the kettle black\", since \"the pot\" is in the song's title. nice wordplay, nice point: someone is acussing the Maynard of something he's guilty of himself, and Maynard is attacking him back, claiming attacker is even guiltier. WHAT they are accusing each other about?\n\r\nNow the most important clue: \"Pissing\" hints to what \"lemon juice\" he was talking about in previous verse.\n\r\nHow \"the fucking hypocrite\" got the _urine_ up in his eye and why? What does it have to do with war on drugs? You have internet, do a research - I don't want to spoil your fun. The answer is not hard to find at all, and it leads to a ton of interesting sites on the topic. If you doubt this interpretation, look again:\n\r\n>You must have been HIGH, HIGH\r\n>kangaroo be stoned\r\n>He's guilty as the government\n\r\nAgain, Maynard is acusing hypocrite \"kangaroo\" (who stands on a soapbox, although his position can easily be shattered) of being HIGH and STONED, and being GUILTY as the government. Being guilty of WHAT? Being high/stoned on WHAT?\n\r\n>Ganja, please, you must have been out your MIND!!!!\n\r\nDefinitely not on Ganja (marijuana), since this is what \"kangaroo\" is accusing Maynard of. Maynard is mocking his attempt (\"Ganja? Please! You must have been out your MIND!!!!\")\n\r\nHaven't got it yet? Another hint:\n\r\n>Weepin' shades of indigo\r\n>Shed without a reason\n\r\nWhat (banned) plant is weeping shades of indigo when cut?\n\r\nAnd the most serious question, again: whose grave \"kangaroo\" has robbed to snow who'se \"cradle\", and what evidence was burned down?\n\r\nIf he wrote this song in middle ages, Maynard would be burnt on stake... if \"kangaroo\" could only understand it's meaning. \n\r\nBut since not even hardcore Tool fan's can... he's safe :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_316": "\nThat's pretty much what other people said, you just made a longer post about it...\n\r\nEither way, how can one, who didn't right the song, claim to know it's exact meaning?

Then, soon after that, the same anti-censorship introductory page appeared on original jamesarthur.net... BUT with non-working links, so that anyone coming to original page (which is higher on Google than mirror on yage) and being re-directed cyclicaly to it from any of the links, would just give up after few clicks.

Maynard is humurously suggesting an excuse for their 'weeping' as being a result of getting lemon juice in their eyes. He takes the analogy further suggesting it was from (literally speaking) pissing on the kettle (piss = lemon juice in this case) which is also an analogy in itself tying the song together.\n\n\r\nA more experimental view on it would be that the hyprocrite has to live with the changes that are set forth due to the 'cozened indigo' putting the spotlight on far more innocent crimes (illegalizing drugs). An indigo is someone who has qualities that are generally used for changing the world for the better. Cozened is being deceitful. So someone who can change the world for the better because of their gifts (being born into power, wealth, etc) turned deceitful and instead used their power for hiding their own crimes.

And they're saying that the government \"must've been high\" when they decided to make what they use illegal. And \"Who are you to wave your finger?\" sort of sums it up, \"Why are law officials pointing their fatty fingers at us? They do the same stuff.\" And \"Kangaroo be stoned; he's as guilty as the government\" sounds like the kangaroo (kangaroo being used as a figure of speech) gets 'stoned' like the government and that makes the kangaroo just as guilty as the government officials that get stoned. And the \"muddy water\" is what color pot is in water: dark brown? I dunno, I've heard that somewhere. And the \"lemon juice\" part talks about how the government is blind, as it's hard to see with lemon juice in your eyes.\n\r\nI might not be right, I'm honestly not sure if I am myself... but I'd love to hear if I'm even close. :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_414": "\nThis song is clearly about hypocrisy, for example the references:\r\n\tThe pot calling the kettle black\r\n\tPeople in glass houses shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t throw stones\r\n\tF_____ hypocrites (couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get any more obvious than that)\r\n\tReference to said hypocrite urinating on those whom he criticizes while urinating in his own eye (symbolic of his supposed clear vision of the subject, some hear \u00e2\u0080\u0098high eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as well even more hypocritical)\n\r\nThe subject of hypocrisy appears to be about legalization of drugs esp. marijuana, but perhaps symbolic, the opium of the people.  Ex: the Pot (common name for marijuana), \u00e2\u0080\u0098you must have been\u00e2\u0080\u00a6high\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Ironic, no? MJK says.\n\r\nI hear people use the term hypocrite in at least two senses:\r\n1.\tSomeone who doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t live up to their professed standards 100% of the time\r\n2.\tSomeone pretending to be something they are not, esp in regards to morals/ ethics\n\r\nIn the case of 1., is any one willing to say that they are PERFECT?  If Maynard is using the term as 1. then he is also a hypocrite, imperfect like the rest of us. And when fellow hypocrites CALL OUT fellow hypocrites (our \u00e2\u0080\u0098scarlet lettermen\u00e2\u0080\u0099) for being hypocritical, then they are DOUBLE hypocrites. And worthy of being dismissed. Or, he is saying he is PERFECT.  Call for the straight jacket. Or more dope.\n\r\nIn the case of 2. the song would have to be referring to someone who is smoking pot/continuing to use, at the same time, working and preaching against its legalization.  If so, then it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to start naming names, not just broad-sweeping generalizations that amount to windmill-jousting and straw-man beating.  \r\nI have never used and am sure there are others likewise. \n\r\nIf Maynard is attacking those who oppose marijuana legalization, yet who have not used, or not currently using the drug, how can he call them a \u00e2\u0080\u0098hypocrite\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in the sense of meaning 2? He cannot. It is merely name-calling and scores 0 (zero) in the debate.  If he reverts to meaning 1., he is a double hypocrite, again worthy of dismissing.\n\r\nTo conclude, Maynard presupposes Christianity when  he evokes \u00e2\u0080\u0098hypocrite\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accusation, all the while denying Christianity.  In an evolutionary worldview, there is no way to account for the concept \u00e2\u0080\u0098hypocrite\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on its own mechanisms.  It is parasitic by necessity.  I am a biology major, please outline the process for me from the beginning, macro or micro level.\n\r\nAges ago, when Tool toured preaching, \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuestion Authority!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t someone get in their face and ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSays who?

You are putting yourself in a position of AUTHORITY when you tell me to do that, you [expletive] hypocrite.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\r\n(Hypocrisy in the Christian church is indeed a problem, but beyond the discussion of this song. If I explained it to you, you most likely would want to deny the reality of the problem, for admitting it, would be more than you would accept.)\n\r\nIt is a crying shame, such talented musicians, giving glory to themselves instead of the triune God who gave them such gifts.   \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_415": "\nthis song is obviosly about maynard getting a rimjob and craping on his girlfriend\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_416": "\nHey, so I seem to have a different take on it than all here.. \n\r\nI believe it is about hypocrisy in government, and also in marijuana trials. not \"stoners\" themselves. \n\r\n\"kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent\"\r\n\"kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent\"\r\n\"kangaroo be stoned he's guilty as the government\"\n\r\nalso: \r\n\"liar, lawyer, mirror show me, what's the difference?\"\n\r\nthese all refer to \"kangaroo courts\" where the jury decide on the outcome of the trial before it ever happens.

You cant ever expect to \"understand\" one of these songs without listening to the rest. Its incomplete. A good deal of ego and pride may be lost should you take his messages personally. Why should I look up the history of a song  when it is speaking to me? What is his purpose or intentions through his music?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_428": "\nwell...i have yet to dive into the meaning of this song...since most of Tool's songs have some kind of complex hidden meaning behind them, i'm not gonna try to decipher it just yet.   i'm just gonna say that this song kicks ass.  the bass and distorted guitar goes so good with Maynard's seductive tone.  it certainly is a song that makes me want to get up and start dancing along with some head banging.  this song totally rocks!!  10,000 days overall isn't their best album but this song should definitely NOT be overlooked..Tool has still got it!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_429": "\nTrying to do this easily. In general, this song is not about a specific topic, however about a specific type of personality, seen on every level of human interaction. Being a phony. Phonies can be practically found everywhere and are especially present in any position of power like for example in politics. Although I think the song refers to that branch, the song is also addressing anybody distorting reality to make himself appear \u00e2\u0080\u009cmorally better\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the cost of others. Sometimes, even I catch myself of being a phony. So the song can also address yourself, if you want. you trow everything in the same pot. meaning you generalize and make no distinct but essential differentiations.\nComing to the lines, the interpretation coming to my mind is as follows:\n\n\"Who are you to wave your finger?\"\n- Who, the f##k do you think you are? - \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must have been out your head\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n- Are you f##king crazy? -\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEye hole deep in muddy waters\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n- You yourself have dirty little secrets -\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou practically raised the dead\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBeing a necromancer is a really bad thing, at least in the fantasy world. If you raised the dead, you have done something really wrong. If you are a necromancer, you are definitely evil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRob the grave to snow the cradle\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nEverybody knows, robbing graves sucks.\n\n-Then burn the evidence down-\nTell everybody: It wasn't me! :P (troll grin)\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoapbox, house of cards, and glass\nSo don't go tossin' your stones around\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nReferring to a saying: Don't throw with stones when sitting in a glass house. Meaning that you are not in the right position of accusing someone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must have been high\nYou must have been high\nYou must have been\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n- You are disillusioned -\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFoot in mouth, and head up ass\nSo what you talkin' 'bout?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nImagine someone being that acrobatic. If you see someone having his foot in his mouth and his head up in his ass, then you know that the person is definitely not able to say anything meaningful.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDifficult to dance 'round this one\nTill you pull it out, boy\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhen some is standing in your way who could expose you, then you use your position to prevent that very person of doing the right thing to hurt you (in a sense of abusively using power). Boy: well, boys know nothing. We all hate boys, right men?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must have been so high\nYou must have been so high\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n- \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 -\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSteal, burrow, reefer\nSave your shady inference\nKangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMethods of being a successful phony. Tell lies, get credit of things you did not accomplish and shift reality!\n(\u00e2\u0080\u00a6)\nI think the song is full of really great metaphors.

Eyeballs deep in muddy waters means your in the same situation and not clean. \"Weeping Cozened Indigo musta got lemon juice in your eye\" is a reference to putting on makeup and fake crying for the court, kangaroo court means to put on a show in court where people dont have a fair chance (another reference to Racism and African Americans getting harsh sentencing due to Marijuana laws) and of course \"You musta been high\" is another Southern phrase that means that you mistakenly thought or believed something and the excuse for your mistake is because you were high out of your mind and not thinking clearly. \"OH, you thought I was going to let you drive my new car? Ha! You must be high! Aka You must be out yo mind!\". Thats it completely. Although I will admit the first verse sounds like a reference to Led Zeppelin stealing from Muddy Waters and it might be about that as well. One verse can reference something else and Tool writes songs with deep meaning. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_442": "\nOK, this from my research of the song, and not my own original ideas. However I find them compelling enough to share, and reiterate here.  This explanation is too fitting to be incorrect.  This song is simply about he The Pot calling the kettle black - but is a diss response to Led Zeppelin (aimed at Plant or Page) by Tool.   I think Page called Tool unoriginal (or made non-complimentary comments) for Tool covering No Quarter live.  \n\nMuddy Water is person not a place as referenced in the song.  Lyrics from Muddy Waters' song \"You need love\" , lyrics as follow \"baby way down inside you need love\"  as ripped of by Zepplin's \"whole lotta love\", and also \"You shook me\" Muddy Waters and LZ song of the same name. Check out all the Youtube videos of LZ rip offs.\n\nWeeping shades of indigo may simple be a reference to the blues style of music which Zeppelin frequently ripped off/ translated into rock. Cozened means to deceive/ Fraud trickery - stolen blues!   \"Got lemon Juice up in your eye\"... Led Zeppelin makes reference to Lemon juice in the Lemon Song - also a ripoff song!\n\nThe list of stolen LZ songs includes Dazed and Confused, Whole lotta Love, Stairway to Heaven, Your Time is Gonna Come, & the Lemon Song and many more.\n\nLZ musta been HIGH... to make such accusations, as they themselves have ripped off countless songs.  ( still amazing) but the likenesses of many of their songs are way too similar to not be be at least \"steal, borrow, reefer save your shady inference\"  I'm pretty Maynard is saying that LZ just got high and tried to play covers! HA!    youtube.com/\u2026\n\nIf you listen the song with, and accept the notion of its about LZ, it really seems this to fit, with a little tongue in cheek commentary: \"foot in mouth and head up asshole\", you must have been so high to criticize a cover song when you are a hypocrite and stole countless melodies and lyrics. \n\nBottom line LZ have the head up their ass and been sooooo high to call Tool \"unoriginal\". yup... thats true.it fits.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_443": "\nIn general I agree with what I've read. Maynard writes about things to cover a broad array, so while some might believe this has to do with the hypocrisy around pot I believe in deals with hypocrisy in society, no matter where it may be found. I will add an observation. The use of clich\u00c3\u00a9s are abundant in this song. Probably more clich\u00c3\u00a9s mentioned in this song than any other ever written and when Maynard does something you better bet it has purpose. I find the use of so many clich\u00c3\u00a9s quite ironic in a song about hypocrisy. Writing with only clich\u00c3\u00a9s isn't writing at all. In doing this Maynard shows the hypocrisy is everywhere and what he's saying is nothing new. Foot in mouth?
