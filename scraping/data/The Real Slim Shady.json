He raps to be funny, deep, make money, to send messages, etc.  He has songs for just about every mood anyone can be in.  I'm pretty sure eminem has at least 1 song that ANYONE can relate to.  He has so many different songs about so many different topics.  This song, for example, is his skill of not caring and being funny(he succeeded).  Eminem is very talented and very deep.

The lyrics are corny in a lot of areas as well including the dumb chorus.  But even through all that he whipped out some decent rhymes and had perfect flow throughout the entire song.  The beat was also catchy.  Other than this, Eminem hasn't made one song worth listening to.  The only reason this had any value to it anyway is because it was his first hit single so he had all the rhymes he could think of at his disposal.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_71": "\n\"im sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you.\"\n\r\nhahah, thats pretty funny.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_72": "\nI love nearly all kinds of music- save stuff like Brittany and shit, but even though rap isn't my favorite genre of music, it's got several very talented artists that do create amazing songs, including eminem. If you hate him, keep that to yourself. Why the hell are you wasting your time looking up songs from singers you don't like and commenting on them. Oh and we DONT whether care if you hate eminem or not. \n\r\nOh and TheAnarchist: \"But Eminem Either Speaks Truth or he's a liar\" LOL!

How can anybody possibly say that every single song of a genre suck, and that all the songs are shit?  I understand that you may not like the music, but you can't say that there's no talent - it seems fairly obvious that it takes a lot of effort and talent to produce a rap like this.\n\r\nI personally love just about every genre of music.  The only this I have trouble liking the majority of is country and hardcore death metal, and even there, I find that there are songs in the genre that I find appealing.\n\r\nAnyways, I LOVE this song, it's funny and catchy.  I have a problem with the fact that I listened to this song when I was in 4th grade, it's extremely inappropriate.  Fortunately I didn't listen to the lyrics too much, just the chorus, haha.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_76": "\nie.

Ive recently got to actually love eminem cos hes so harsh, and some of his songs & videos are just bare funny. I dont care if other people know I love him, a lot of his fans also love Metallica and Avenged Sevenfold, which is awesome cos hes reaching all sorts of demographics.
