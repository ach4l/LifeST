I write what I feel and I was not feeling \"dark\". if you want \"dark\" then immerse yourself into murder ballads. thank you\n\r\nNicholas Edward Cave\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI think that is a fair interpretation, however, I think it could also be about forbidden love, an affair, not just old lovers.  It's clear that they are old lovers with a history.  Burning bridges, makes me guess that she is married.  Finding myself in a similare situation in my life, I find the line \"We make a little history, baby/Every time you come around\" especially beautiful.  Inside of a relationship that can have no future, I found myself telling my lover that I will remember him when I am an old woman.

I think the beauty of it is that everyone can relate to it in a certain way. To me it sounds so much like the thing I went through with my ex. I loved her (and still do) so much, but she cheated on me. And I don't even think she intented to do it, but more because she felt afraid in our relationship and not ready to commit yet. So anyway, I can really relate to the different lines of the song in this way.\n\r\nCome sail your ships around me\r\nAnd burn your bridges down\r\nWe make a little history, baby\r\nEvery time you come around\r\n- This is saying that she should come to me, sail her ships around me and burn the bridges after her. Choosing for someone and don't look back. 'Cause we're great when we are together, making history.\n\r\nCome loose your dogs upon me\r\nAnd let your hair hang down\r\nYou are a little mystery to me\r\nEvery time you come around \r\n- This could be interpreted as hurting someone (loose their dogs upon you) and giving up on a relationship (letting the hair/head hang down). The coming around here can mean changing their feelings towards you instead of the physical interpretation of coming over. This also adds to the mystery part, since it is a mystery why they can change the feelings they have for you.\n\r\nWe talk about it all night long\r\nWe define our moral ground\r\nBut when I crawl into your arms\r\nEverything comes tumbling down \r\n- This I can relate to very much. I always said I would never let anyone cheat on me. That was like a moral ground for me. But when you are in the arms of the person you love, all those feelings of anger, hurt, and betrayal make way for the love you feel and you forgive them everything just to be able to stay in those arms.\n\r\nYour face has fallen sad now\r\nFor you know the time is nigh\r\nWhen I must remove your wings\r\nAnd you, you must try to fly \r\n- She is sad because she knows that what has happened is wrong and that she can't go on like this. She has to choose what she wants. And when she chooses for a relationship that means having her wings clipped in a certain way. So she must try to find the freedom she needs but without the wings, without the absolute freedom of doing whatever she wants, without thinking about anyone else.\n\r\nSo in short I think it's about the two sides of a relationship: the verses with the ship part being the good moments and the verses with the dog part being the bad ones. But if you want the relationship to succeed you have to get past those bad moments and accept giving up certain things in return for others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_22": "\nits about a couple fighting and then one of them (presumably Cave) stopping and letting the other win to end the argument and sort of start over\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_23": "\nA good half of the lines in this song are specific literary or historical references to war.
