{"comment_0": "\nSomeone's probably mentioned this before, but I'll add it anyway since it's pure awesomeness:\n\r\n\"When Brian May presented the final demo to Mercury, he had doubts that Mercury would be physically capable of singing the song's highly demanding vocal line, due to the extent of his illness at the time. To May's surprise, when the time came to record the vocals, Mercury consumed a measure of vodka and said \"I'll fucking do it, darling!\" then proceeded to nail the vocal line in one take without problems.\"\n\r\nFreddie was seriously amazing. He managed to live more in 45 years than a lot of people do in twice that. I love this song: it just captures how he lived perfectly.\n\r\nAlso, I think \"I'll fucking do it, darling!\" is going to be my catchphrase from now on.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nIts about life. Replace the word 'show' with 'life'. Its saying that there are hard times in life but we should carry on and still aim high. Freddie Mercury was very optimistic, even when he found out he had aids, this was his outlook on life and if we all think about it it should be true. Its telling us that life goes on regardless fo what happens. Very meaningful.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI like to think that this song was about Freddie's attitude in the face of his final stages of AIDS.  He knew he was dying, but he fought up to the very end.  I think he felt that he couldn't give up.  Life is a battle, but despite whatver comes our way, the show must go on.  Also, I think that it was a way for Freddie to tell the world that despite his illness, he continued to make music up until the very end.  He loved his fans, and I think he wanted to please them as long as it was humanly possible for him to do so.\n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThe song meaning is obvious, but this is just on of those songs that transcends the meaning of the words.  Listening to to Freddie Mercury sing this one is beyond any other Queen song; he lifts it up from sappy to spiritual.  \n\r\nIt carries the weight of Mozart's Requiem.  Many writers sing about dying, but very few (Roy Orbison comes to mind) have a chance to write about it when they know it's coming.  Mercury conquers death with this song (\"Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die/I can fly my friend\" \"I'll face it with a grin/I'm never giving in\").

I watched every tv program dedicated in Freddies' honour & as i grew older gradually bought the albums & then I heard this song, & I cried.

I can fly - my friends.\" - He is saying that his image has been forever embedded into the memories of his loving fans, and so has Queen's legacy that can only grow and never die down.

I feel like the lyrics amazingly capture things from both perspectives-- from the protagonist as well as the audience.\r\nAs proof of its power, this was voted in a British poll as the song people would most like to be played at their funeral.  Personally I don't think quite that far ahead, but it is definitely my favorite Queen song.\r\nThe metaphor of the show is amazing in that it applies particularly to Queen in a way, but also relates to everyone else who has to paint a smile on while going through difficult times.  It also gives a nod to the classic theater axiom-- the show is a magical moment, so do whatever you can to keep it alive as long as possible.  Interestingly the verses 1 and 2 seem to contradict this idea-- they are the truth that the singer is facing, but in the end he defies it by saying that he needs the show to get him through the end, too.  Freddie was always transformed this way when he got on stage.\r\nThe music is pure genius.  The funereal opening Deacon/Taylor chord sequence plays nearly throughout, and is something that Freddie almost fights against as he makes his runs at the end.

No matter how much crap hits us, we're forced to take it with a smile.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_59": "\nthere are not words\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_60": "\nGreat song, this songs sums the man to what he really was- a genius- highlighting the fact that his time is coming to an end and that truly the show must indeed go on\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_61": "\nAs my name would suggest, this is my favorite song ever written.  \n\r\nThe original phrase of \"the show must go on\" is often used when something, in the performing arts, goes really really REALLY wrong, either someone dies or something happens, like a theatre burning down or something.  That's what Freddie's saying in these lyrics.  He's saying that \"I may be about to die.....but i'm gonna keep going until i've got nothing left, and then the show must still go on......\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_62": "\nWhen I first heard this song I was crying so hard!

I was only 7 years old, bit I was really shocked and upset by the news because I already knew and loved Queen (my parents were their fans). I was very moved by this song and I understood its message in spite of the fact that I didn't understand the lyrics (because I didn't know English yet). A couple of days later I've bought my very first album and it was Innuendo.

Freddie was going to pass away very soon after its recording...or the release of Innuendo. All of them knew it. The song is about him laughing in the face of death and being strong. But it is also about the fact that he wanted his friends to continue recording their own material - and to release their final recordings with him. I.E. Made in Heaven, etc. It is a mixture of both Freddie's personal \"going on\" in his last days - staying strong and defiant - and his realization that his friends would now have to continue without him. Sure, it could also mean \"life\" as well.

I found this site then to try to find the meaning of it because although his death was imminent, at the end it came sudden and we never had the chance to talk about what was happening to him, I mean in detail, how he felt about it. Somehow we were afraid to talk about it although we kept hugging and give each others strenght. What's there to say when you know what the inevitable is? It breaks my hearth every time I hear this song, yet I do play it to feel near him, to try to see if there was something he wanted to tell us with it. \r\nI guess each of us can have our own interpretation of this song and still be right. \n\r\nIn this verse in particular:\n\r\nThe Show must go on!Yeah!\r\nInside my heart is breaking,\r\nMy make-up may be flaking,\r\nBut my smile, still, stays on!\n\r\nI find the part that hurts the most is that he put up a good act, trying to make it look like things were normal as much as he possibly could, never complaining about the pain, and the fear to die that he must have had. Putting on the mask of a smile for all of us to see to hide the pain that he feels inside\r\nHow some people nearing death find such strenght is behond me, and some that know that are going to die, do actually give up, perhaps it depends on how much they value what's around them. \n\r\n\"Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance.\" -  those things that others never listened to, and that now they won't matter how they'll turn out because he won't have control over them any longer\n\r\n\"Does anybody know what we are living for?\r\nI guess i'm learning\" - understanding parts of life whatever they may be, like \r\nthose things what we think are so important to do, like our jobs, our ambitions etc, at the expense of having more time at home with families,and at the expense of actually living life to the fullest while we're healty\n\r\n\"Outside the dawn is breaking - he's ready for another day, for another fight to live\n\r\n\"But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free!\"   - while inside his soul he wants it all to be over\n\r\nI realize Freddy was different than my brother, yet I think when someone is dying, what they feel is pretty well all the same ...we're all human after all\n\r\nR.I.P.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_74": "\nwell my friends this song is about freddie last days.As far as i know he knew what would happen to him, but he was encouraging his friends to keep up with the great song and feeling regret about what happened to him.the title says what happens to me you guys must continue to live from music and don't worry about me.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_75": "\nI first heard this song in conjuction with a favorite anime character. hearing that this song was written in defiance of a dying showman... really makes the show match so much more. the character in question ended up dying without achieving all of his goals... and his son took up the deadly mantle afterwords to continue his work...\n\r\nthe show must truely go on. <3\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_76": "\nThis being the VERY LAST song recorded on an album while Freddie Mercury is extremely moving.
