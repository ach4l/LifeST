Lovecraft reference fits into the theme of the album, which is being conformity or being restrained and controlled by others. I think that that's just on the surface, when i first heard it, i thought it was talking about how the A-bomb is the ultimate control -- It's use or lack of it has control of the future of the world.\n\r\n\"Messenger of Fear in sight\r\nDark deception kills the light.\" -- Could refer to the Cuban Missile Crisis, when the tangle of espionage almost killed the world.\n\r\n\"He watches\r\nlurking beneath the sea\" -- Nuclear submarines could end things faster than world leaders could react.\n\r\n\"Crawling Chaos, underground\r\ncult has summoned, twisted sound\" -- Underground testing on the bomb, which was summoned by the Manhattan Project (a sort of cult, not letting anybody in and keeping many dark secrets)\n\r\n\"Out from ruins once possessed\r\nfallen city, living death\" -- Hiroshima was destroyed, while the fallout caused radiation sickness (living death)\n\r\n\"Not dead which eternal lie\r\nstranger eons Death may die\" -- Not only a reference to the poem, but the fact that the planet will become eternally dead. In the fact that there is nobody left to die, Death itself dies.\n\r\n\"Drain you of your sanity\r\nface The Thing That Should Not Be.\" -- People ignore the atomic bomb because it's too scary a thing to face. Should people continue to ignore it, there could be disastrous consequences of not realizing when it is going to come.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_80": "\nSo many ignorant, illiterate morons trying to \"educate\" others.\n\r\nFirst of all, this song is not based on H.P. Lovecraft's short story \"Call of Cthulhu\". It is based upon his novella \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\". The \"Thing That Should Not Be\" in question is aquatic deity Daigon, for which there is a cult founded and dedicated to it within the city Innsmouth. The \"hybrid children\" are the Deep Ones, which are basically half-human half-fish mutations created by Daigon.\n\r\nSecondly, there is NO deeper meaning to the story. There is nothing to be taken away from this song, there is no implication to anyone's life experiences, or purpose to the song. It is nothing more than Lovecraft's story in song form.\n\r\nFinally, quit trying to educate people on subject matter you know nothing about.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
