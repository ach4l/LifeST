I feel the lyrics describe an introverted guy who finally finds a girl that understands what it means to be lonely. The \"door\" spoken of in the song is the guy's soul, and the girl is the only person who has ever been able to make it \"crack open.\" She dies (\"The door is closed, so are your eyes\"), and he goes on waiting for death, alone again, because she was the only one with the \"key\" to his soul. I can almost relate to this song...I've yet to meet that girl.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\n\"Lay beside me, tell me what they've done\"\r\nHe's find another person, who has gone through the same ordeal he has, society rejects them both, and tries to get her to confide and console in him her experiences and demons of her past.\n\r\n\"Speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run\r\nThe door is locked now, but it's open if you're true\"\r\nHe wants her to say things that will help ease the darkness he in consumed in.\r\nThe door symbolising his secrets, the demons, the darkness, pain, suffering, and memories of his past which he will expose and confide to her if her actions are genuine and are really out of love & compassion.\r\nThe door also symbolises the passage to freedom and the gateway to redemption.\r\nHe wants her to help him find solace and bury the burdens of his past. \n\r\n\"If you can understand the me, than I can understand the you\"\r\nIf she can understand what he's gone through and has been in similar circumstances than surely he can understand what she's gone through as well. \n\r\n\"Lay beside me, under wicked sky\r\nThe black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyse\"\r\nHe is asking her to join him in the \"darkness\" with the demons that haunt them. Every passing second they are consumed in this pain and suffering they both feel for their own as well as each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ordeals, \"paralysing\" them in the process.\n\r\n\"The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through\r\nBlack hearts scarring darkness still, but there's no sun shining through\"\r\nThey both seek solace and comfort in each other hoping for redemption. The \"Sun shining\" through the door symbolises the redemption, the forgiveness they both desperately seek to overcome their demons behind the door to their past.\n\r\n\"Black hearts\" symbolising their own two hearts, still in the \"Darkness\" with their demons. (When I say demons I don't mean literally, I mean it figuratively as in \"demons\" symbolising their woes, negative experiences, haunting memories of their past etc)\n\n\r\n\"What I've felt, what I've known\r\nTurn the pages, turn the stone\r\nBehind the door, should I open it for you\"\r\nHe reflecting what he was taught and programmed to believe whilst growing up by the world, society 's norms, the system, His parents, other people and God.\r\nHe wondering if he should help her seek redemption by opening the door for her, after all she's trying to help him (refer to what i said before about what I think the door symbolises)\n\r\n\"Yeah\r\nWhat I've felt, what I've known\r\nSick and tired, I stand alone\r\nCould you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you\r\nOr are you unforgiven too?\"\r\nHe's faced his battles and the demons of his past alone and wonders if she can be with him as he \"turns the pages\" of his past like a storybook and reads it out a loud to her and help him see through it not alone but together, relieve him of his pain and memories by sharing them with her. \n\r\nIf you notice, when you tend to share your problems with some one else it feels as though they share half the weight of your burden, yeah well that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I'm trying to say here.\r\nHe contemplates if she's like him too . . Unforgiven that is.\n\r\n\"Lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear\"\r\nHe's trying to convince her to help him confide his darkness in her and promises it won't affect her in anyway, or hurt her in the process (which is a load of bull, because how can not another person's experience especially that of a person whom you love not kill you, to know that muthafckers out there have broken them)\n\r\n\"She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again\"\r\nAs he's telling her all his secrets, he's unsure if she stills loves him the same still, or if her love for him changes.\n\r\n\"She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone\r\nBlack hearts scarring darker steel, yes, she'll be there when I'm gone\r\nYes, she'll be there when I'm gone\"\r\nHe's saying that he'll be able to be \"forgiven\" because of her but the thing is he'll be forgiven before her and he will no longer have to live in the \"darkness\" with his demons as he has found redemption at last. \r\nShe on the other hand is still unforgiven and thus lies in the darkness with her demons alone.\n\r\n\"What I've felt, what I've known\r\nTurn the pages, turn the stone\r\nBehind the door, should I open it for you\"\r\nLike I said before I think the chorus is the \"aftermath\" of him finally seeking redemption and leaving the darkness, since it's in past tense with the \"I've\".\r\nNow that he's free, he wonders if he should \"open the door\", help her find redemption as well.\n\r\n\"Yeah\r\nWhat I've felt, what I've known\r\nSick and tired, I stand alone\"\r\nEven though he's found redemption and is free of his demons, he's alone and misses her.\n\r\n\"Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you\r\nOr are you unforgiven too?\"\r\nHe's wondering if she could join him and leave the darkness of her demons and find forgiveness too. \r\nHe'll wait for her on the other side of the door, where he's found redemption and accepted his demons.\n\r\n\"Lay beside me, tell me what I've done\r\nThe door is closed, so are your eyes\"\r\nHe's come back and returns to ask her what she thinks of him now, now that she knows everything terrible of his past (The door was open for her to enter and see into his memories of his past but now it's closed meaning she's returned from his past and he's finished confiding his ordeals to her).  \r\nThere is an \"insight motif\". Her eyes are closed now symbolising she has finished searching for answers of his past and knows everything now.\n\r\n\"But now I see the sun, now I see the sun\r\nYes, now I see it\"\r\nHe finally found redemption through her, because she accepts him for who he is and now he's is FORGIVEN. \n\r\n\"I take this key\r\nAnd I bury it in you\r\nBecause you're unforgiven too\"\r\nFiguratively speaking the \"key\" to the door he's giving her symbolises he's allowing her permanent access to his memories and she can ask him about his problems. Also he's giving her to key to access her own painful memories of the past as well maybe.\n\r\nI wonder if metallica intended to do a pun considering the title of the song \"The Unforgiven II\" . .The second unforgiven person would be the girl who loves him. and In the chorus as well \"'cause you're unforgiven too (II)\" . . coincidence or what . .creative nonetheless. I love this song.\n\r\nWell that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my take on it.

He has not forgiven himself for his \nperceived failures and is looking for an escape.  \"Turn the page, turn the \nstone\" refers to keeping an open mind and not completely\nshutting out a chance for being in a healthy relationship.  \n\"If you can understand the me, than I can understand the you\" means this person is looking for someone who can understand him\nbecause he cannot understand himself. This is also reinforced by saying\n\"Lay beside me, tell me what I've done\" because he doesnt understand\nwhy he keeps failing and is unaware of the consequences of his actions.  By saying \"I take this key\nAnd I bury it in you\nBecause you're unforgiven too\" means that he is searching\nfor someone who has shared his painful experience so they can\nboth heal each other's hearts.  He must feel that he cant trust another person unless they understand what he's been through.   \"Never free\nNever me\n'cause you're unforgiven too\" means that the man can only see himself through the eyes\nof another person and therefore can not find forgiveness through that person.  He cannot see himself for what he really is.  He is never free because he \nsolely reliant on other people to find his identity. However, the one he seeks is most likely broken and sees themself through others as well.  In a way, the man and his lover act as reflections of each other.  Because they both look for themselves in the other person who can understand them, they will only see their own tormented self through the other person. This perpetuates the man's long string of unsuccessful relationships. He must learn to forgive himself instead of looking for forgiveness in others, otherwise he will never be completely forgiven.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nShe doesn't mean a girl ...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nI agree with the poster who feels it's about an introverted guy who meets a girl, but with a different spin:\n\nIt's the character from the first song, who feels like everyone in life has betrayed him (everyone's \"unforgiven\"). He starts a relationship with a woman and he wonders if she may finally be different from everyone else he feels has labeled and betrayed him. The song is largely about him contemplating whether to totally open himself up to her (\"behind the door should I open it for you?\"), or will she just betray him like everyone else (\"or are you unforgiven too?\").\n\nIn the end, for whatever reason, he decides she's the same as everyone else (\"because you're unforgiven too.\").

I think that way, because of \"the door\" mentionen so many times in the song. I will start with the first time we hear about that door:\r\n\"The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true\" - the door to his heart is locked, it means he is in a relationship with one of the women, but he wouldn't hesitate to unlock that door and let the second woman in ( and get rid of the first one ) if she is truthful.\r\n\"The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through\" - he has let the second woman in his heart, he has chosen her over the first one, but she doesn't turn out to be what he wanted, thus the lyric \"no sun shining through\".\r\n\"Behind the door, should I open it for you?\" - those lyrics actually come after \"the door\" has been opened. The second woman is behind the door, which means she is so close to his heart, just a couple of steps away from entering it. But now the man hesitates - \"should I open it for you?\". He has grown unsure of his thoughts and choices. But as we saw in the second sighting of \"the door\" he indeed has opened it.\r\n\"The door is closed, so are your eyes\r\nBut now I see the sun, now I see the sun\r\nYes now I see it!\" - let's first focus on the eyes. They are closed, just like the door. Now, when are a person's eyes closed ? When he sleeps ? Nope, the door wouldn't be closed then. Death. The second woman has died. Her eyes shut, just like the door. And now, with the second woman gone, the man finally sees the sun, he so long lusted for. The first woman. The one he left. He has realised that she is more truthful than the second one, she is the one he wants, she is his sun.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nThe meaning to this song for me is biblical.\n\nIt is the story of Lot and his Wife while they were fleeing the destruction of Sodom and she turned to look back and became a pillar of salt.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nLay beside me, tell me what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done\nSpeak the words I want to hear, to make my demons run\nThe door is locked now but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opened if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re true\nIf you can understand the me, then I can understand the you\n=============================================\n\nThe child from Unforgiven I has met a woman with the same experiences\nas him.

The light behind the door represents hope.  The pages turning to stone is there life stopping with this tragedy(a baby). \"She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again\" He doesn't know if she still loves him, but she knows that they will have to be together for the rest of their lives becuase they now have a child, and even when he he dies she will live in the same house,\"she'll be there when I'm gone\" The door represents their relationship,\"Behind the door, should I open it for you\"  He really wants them to be together and start a conversation, and he tries to start it off with should i open it (the conversation) for you.{Then again he could just be mad at his life and kills his wife becuase she is unforgiving just as life is \"The door is closed, so are your eyes \r\nBut now I see the sun, now I see the sun \r\nYes, now I see it\", the sun represents freedom}\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_53": "\nASFalcon13 nailed it as James Hetfield has said himself that it deals with love and murder.

I think its true, because listen to how climatic the song is. Listen to how James sings each lyric, and then at the end he emphasizes it. just my theory anyways....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_56": "\nThis song has alot of meanings to me seeing as how I've listened to it, analyzed it and pondered over it countless times as I do with every Metallica song seeing as I'm a Metallicaholic. First of all you have to listen to the \"Unforgiven\" before listening to this song. In the \"Unforgiven\" there is a lyric that goes; \"this whipping boy done wrong\". . .a whipping boy is someone who is used to take the blame of someone and is often actually \"whipped\". Princes used to make these out of servants of theirs, they would blame something that they did on their servant and he would be whipped. Or it also means a slave, a scapegoat, someone that is punished for the misdeeds of others. So the boy that the \"Unforgiven\" is about is obviously some sort of slave or servant. He is abused all of his life and knows nothing of compassion. So therefore in the end he makes a list of all the people that he hates, all of the people that made his life a living Hell and he dubs them all \"Unforgiven\", hence the lyric \"So I dub thee Unforgiven.\" He is a bitter man due to all that he has endured. Now on to the \"Unforgiven II\". In this song it still focuses on the man but it has another character in it. It focuses on the same \"whipping boy\" but it also has a woman involved. This man is asked for help by the young woman, and he asks her \"tell me what they've done\", but then he realizes that she is one of the people he swore to never forgive, \"or are you unforgiven too?\" He rubs it in her face that he hates her and that she never helped him. He goes on and tells her why he is the way he is \"What I've felt what I've known. . .So sick and tired I stand alone!\" but he gives her a small amount of help. But it comes to be that she is in love with him \"She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again. . .She'll be there when I'm gone.\" he knows that she loves him and he also uses this against her. He is pretty sure that no matter what he tells her she will put up with it due to her love, and she does. He won't let her into him, he hates her and he is just tolerating her presence, \"The door is locked now. . .Should I open it for you?\" He leads her on and then he still comes back to \"Or are you Unforgiven too?\" He eventually ends up hurting her, very badly, this can be interpereted as emotionally, mentally or physically. You can tell he has hurt her 'cause he asks 'Tell me what I've done.' I can imagine her being bed-ridden or forced into a coma due to shock, \"the door is closed so are your eyes.\" He probably influenced her to commit suicide because he wasn't returning any love to her. You can also tell her that he has fallen in love with her fafter he hurt her because he starts to care for her with the lyrics \"But now I see the Sun. . .I take this key and bury it in you.\" He tries to impart himself in her because he loves her now. But when she \"awakens\" or realizes how cruel he was she dubs him \"Unforgiven\". She no longer has any love for him and she comes to adapt his philosophy of pessimism and then she starts to hate him. You can deduce this from the lyrics \"Never free, Never me! (\"Cause you're Unforgiven too!)\" The man cries out that he is never free and never happy, in a sense, but then the girl says \"cause you're unforgiven too\". Now that he has finnally decided not to be an asshole anymore she's not having anymore of it. When you listen to the song and hear the last lyrics imagine the boy shouting \"Never free, Never me!\" and the girl yelling \"Cause you're unforgiven too!\" and just leaving him by himself. Now he is the \"Unforgiven\", that's why it's called the \"Unfogiven II\" because now he is the second unforgiven, he is unforgiven too or as well. So basically the song is about people who are mean and hatefull and who are obviously loved, but end up pushing the people who love them away from with their hate. Sorry to give you such a deep analysis hope you enjoyed reading this, that's the best definition I can give for this magnificent song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_57": "\ni like beans, you are the least intelligent person on this site (i'm tryin to be polite) you are ignorant and rude and you don't think before you type. go die. load myself is right. just read the lyrics after reading the first unforgiven, and it is so obvious. you really over-react, i like beans. and like i said, go die.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_58": "\nwow\r\nthere are a lot of interesting interpretations that i have read here, and some i never even thought of...\n\r\ni think beans has the right idea when he says UII is about a guy \"who wants a girlfriend to pick him back up again.\"\n\r\nthe rest we disagree on.  I dont think he killed her.  Someone also said the light = heaven or something... i dont think so.  I think door = his heart, and light = love/truth/good, like basic symbolism, the light reflects those things.\n\r\nthe chorus says \"What I've felt, what I've known\r\nTurn the pages, turn the stone\r\nBehind the door, should I open it for you\"\n\r\n1st line is just a reflection of UI as in his hate for those who try to control him, turn the pages/stone he is wondering if he should change his life, should he open his heart to ppl, etc.  And he's asking if he should open the door (his heart) for some1.\n\r\nthen i disagree with beans about the killing and him treating her bad.  I think its the other way, she cheated on him.  \"She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again\r\nShe lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone \"  She loves him in she says she does but then she doesnt because she cheats on him.  Thats why you have the line of her being there.  Sure she'll be there (physically) but there is no love.  Hence \"dead sure she'll be there\" in that she is not there mentally, there is no love for him.  He didnt kill her or treat her bad.\n\r\nBut he's now unsure if he should give her another chance or not?  Thats why her eyes are closed, b/c she cant look him in the eyes since she cheated.  Then when he says \"now i see the sun\" etc, he's seeing the light, but my conclusion is that he realises that she doesnt love him.\n\r\nThats why in the conclusion he buries the key in her and dubs HER unforgiven too, b/c he's saying she's one of those ppl who ends up hurting him.\n\r\nSee, in UI he dubs the \"society\" Unforgiven b/c they hurt him, and here he is dubbing HER as one of them b/c she hurt him as well.  If he hurt her, he wouldnt dub her Unforgiven.  He isnt the Unforgiven (thats a mistake!! SOCIETY IS THE UNFORGIVEN)\n\r\nAlso, if you watch the video of the song, in the end, the boy leaves the girl, eventhough she has the key to his heart, and he cant see her eyes since her back is to him b/c she cant face him for cheating on him.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_59": "\nthis song is so deep it would make my brain explode to try and make sense of it.. it lulls me into a state of depression.. but i like it\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_60": "\nFUCKKK this song is way too deep for my little brain....lol   but its fucking awsum!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_61": "\ni almost burst into tears each time i sing it, thats what i like about it, its great to sing to, and a nice little air guitar in the solo helps too, lol\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_62": "\nthis is better than the first Unforgiven. better singing and better guitar work. the chorus is so amazing and I still can't get that crunchy sound on my guitar. the solo is simple but uncanny. the video is a little lame. this is probably my favorite Metallica solo to sing to. the song itself is self explanitory.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_63": "\n*song to sing to, not solo. if anyone cares\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_64": "\nI can relate to this song so much.

It never reveals a certain gender, but I'm assuming it's a woman. He tries to get to know her, and when her heart finally opens, (\"black hearts scarring darkness still\") he realizes that she's no better than the others. He begins to show her a false personality (\"behind the door, should I open it for you?\"). He's trying to find someone who will treat him differently, someone to care for and that cares for him (\"could you be there, 'cause I'm the one that waits for you\") but he doesn't believe this woman is the one (\"or are you unforgiven too?\"). Then she's stricken with an illness or death. Personally, I believe death. \n\r\nI can see where people believe that he killed her because of the line \"Lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear.\" I had to think a while to find it's relation to the song but I've found it. That's the turning point. With that line, he readies her for the opening of his \"door\". She is, of course, deceased, but he wants to open his heart to the only one who'd ever listen, the only one who'd ever cared. \"She'll be there when I'm gone\" states how he will never forget her. He finally opens his heart to her with the same lyric that he once mocked her with \"behind the door, should I open it for you?\" I think that line is a metaphor for him crying for her, as well as the obvious opening of the heart. \n\r\nBut he's alone once again (\"Sick and tired, I stand alone\"). Then he misses her and can't forgive himself for pushing her away with accusations (\"Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one that waits for you/Or are you unforgiven too?\") He can't believe what he's done. He hated the only person who's ever loved him, and he can't make amends (\"Lay beside me, tell me what I've done/ the door is closed so are your eyes/ but now I see the sun\"). He tumbles into a distrought chaos of regret, asking himself why it had to happen that way, and never recovers.\n\r\nThe key to his heart lied solely with that woman and he refused access to her. He will forever be burdened with regret, because he can never forgive himself (\"Never free, never me, 'cause you're unforgiven too\"). He is unforgiven, too. \n\r\nI enjoy this song. It does what many have failed to do: make music more than just instruments and vocals. I think James put his own demons in this song. This song could be a symbol for a \"loved and lost\" relationship of his. This song is too sad to be just a story that he made up.

My first impression of the song was of a man who murdered a wife whom he tried to, but could not, love.  I got the impression that the paralysis they shared was that neither was capable of actually feeling love.  They left the door open for each other, but neither could enter.   He killed her hoping that he could at least feel something new, because he was sick of trying for so long to feel some way about someone that he wasn't capable of feeling.  \n\r\nMaybe my interpretation of the song isn't the same as what James's was when he wrote it.  Maybe he literally murdered her, maybe he only metaphorically killed her, but the lyrics strongly suggest to me that, either way, this song depicts a man (possibly \"dead\" himself) lying next to a dead woman...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_98": "\nI love this song it makes me cry cuz me and my ex used to listen to this song b4 he died so it means alot to me\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_99": "\nWhy women love this song?

In this one, he thinks he has finally found his answer in a girl, but he isn't for sure that she is the answer. He doesn't realy want to put all of his faith in that idea, because usually things don't turn out in his favor. She has done something [possibly infidelity, or maybe something else] that he sees as wrong, or that made him see that \"she loves him not.\" But he knows she did love him, but it doesn't matter now, because \"she'll never love again.\" This could mean that he killed her, or he just broke her heart. He feels like just as he has been scorned and unforgiven, she was too. Regardless, the outcome is still that he questions his actions of letting her get close to him.

Actually, it's my fav song. I love it more than the first, but only slightly. THey are both damn good songs. Anyway on to what I think.\n\r\nI just watched the theatrical video for The Unforgiven, then the vid for UII, and I came to a realization. If you watch the first video (theatrical. iTunes, $2.) it really flushes out The Unfogiven. It shows the boy with a friend, a girl in a white dress and they are playing. Then it goes on to show the boy go into a sewer and make it his own room in the conformist society. It ends with boy, now an old man, digging out a block of stone from the wall and covering the entrance to his room and locking it. Then, from where he took the block, the sun shines in and he dies.\r\nNOW, to the point, if you listen to the Unforgiven II right after (or during, i havn't tried during yet) the song matches almost perfectly with the video for The Unforgiven! (Ok, not with timeing or anything, but with meaning.) So, what I think is that the two songs really are interchangable. Like, they are both about the same boy at the same time, but one ends with him dying alone and regretfull, and the other with him finding someone to share the sun with.\n\r\nNow, the meaning of this.\n\r\nAt the end of The Unforgiven, the old man \"prepares/to die regretfully\". I think The Unforgiven II is about the regret. Like, and alternate life flashed before his eyes as he died. He realizes, he could have taken comfort in his friend (Lay beside me, tell me what they've done\". He could have opened his heart to her instead of becoming bitter \"Lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear\" and could have comforted her \"Lay beside me, tell me what I've done\" but he didin't (The door is closed so are your eyes). He just went to his corner of the universe and slammed the door shut. Just my scattered thought. What do you think.\n\r\nBTW, I'm a Straight guy, and I love this song more than the first.

He may have said that this song relates to love and murder but generally poets (because that's what Hetfield really is) are poor analysts of their own texts. What I think is that so far (until Load and Reload) in his own personal life, Hetfield was living a chaotic and lonely life, trying to solve many things with his own past. On Load and Reload, the lyrics are more direct, the music is not so speedy as the previous albums. He takes their time to say things and to put his feelings in words.\n\r\nWhen he says Lay beside me it won't hurt, it could also mean lay beside me, don't be afraid of what I am I am not going to hurt you.\r\nShe loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again = she doesn't seem to make up her mind about him, but she'll never love anyone else than him.\r\nNow I see the sun: now I am loved and see how I could be happy \r\nI always thought that he wrote this song more or less at the time he met his wife.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_127": "\nI have no idea why you would say poets are poor analysts of their own work, and also, that the song does not have the meaning Hetfield ascribes to it. It is perfectly possible that the song is about love and murder on a superficial level, but those being the explicit themes does not mean that those are not merely metaphors. I also disagree that the song is related to his wife or any other particular person - but this is only my personal interpretation. The way I see it, is the lack of what he desires in his life that is the primum mobile of the song, not one single individual. Everything, every instance of being wronged, is compounded and generalized into terms of erotic love, because that is where betrayal hurts the most (and perceived betrayal is, at least to me, what the song is mostly about).\n\r\nNow, whether it be actual or imagined betrayal, his reaction is that of immense pain. If he leaves her, he is forsaking love. If he stays with her, he is forsaking himself. So even at the cost of longterm unhappiness and solitude, he decides to stay true to himself and not forgive the betrayal.\n\r\nThe girl - the unforgiven - for her part, is merely guilty of not understanding him. I have a much milder view on the text in that it does not involve murder or cheating, or concrete betrayal, even. The problem, to me, is that he made the mistake of thinking that they were similar and compatible; he wanted to be understood, and thought he could get that understanding from her. But from the lines such as \"the door cracks open/but there's no sun shining through,\" it is apparent that he will find no light, i.e., no intellectual grasp on what he is about coming from her.

I always thought the story was a continuation of \"The Unforgiven.\" The first one is about growing up and getting treated like shit your whole life. And then finally you're just like \"fuck this shit. I don't deserve to be treated this way\" so you never forgive those people in your life. Then, in the second one, you finally meet someone that's been through the same shit as you. You begin to fall in love but you're not sure if you can trust that person given everything you've gone through (\"The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true\" \"Behind the door, should I open it for you\"). But once you let her (or him) through the door, you realize what a bitch she (or he) is because she treats you like shit too (\"Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through\") so you decide that she's unforgiven 2 (too). Many of you said that in the end he decides to kill her. I'm not sure if this is what James was going for, but the lyrics make a lot of sense. \"Lay beside me, tell me what I've done The door is closed, so are your eyes\" He uses the door as a metaphor for trust again saying that it's closed now. And \"so are your eyes\" might mean that she's lying beside him dead. \"I take this key And I bury it in you Because you're unforgiven too\" This means that that you are burying the key to the door along with her because you don't feel like you can trust anyone anymore, so you're not going to open the door for anyone ever again. You feel like an idiot and you feel betrayed and filled with pain, so you're never going to let it happen again.\r\nThis is one of my favorite Metallica songs. Many of their songs are about death and destruction (which I do still like) but this one shows a deeper and more meaningful side to James's songwriting.

The main verse riff is by far the best clean metallica riff, though if you play guitar you can see the similarities between most of their clean riffs. Chronologically, fade to black, to live is to die, the unforgiven II, and the day that never comes all follow rather similar chord patterns, but this one is the best.

They relate to the darkness within eachother. The shared pain brings them closer.\nThen the man begins to exhibit some of the controlling behaviour of his upbringing toward his new partner and/or their children if they have any. He, perhaps unintentionally, reverted to the behaviour that he had been done unto him, because that was all he knew. What he does hurts her deeply. She leaves him but still loves him.\nBoth broken, hearts blackened and hard as ever. She tells him she will wait for him if he can change his ways, then they can be together again. This is a glimmer of hope, the sun. But in the mean time and if he cannot change forever, she must be strong without him and bear the shockwaves of his actions alone. She doesn't know if she can forgive him and he is hurt because she abandoned him.\nIn the end I think they reconcile. Bury the key to the \"door\" that had been locked up until that point, in each other. Maybe if they ever feel betrayed by the other again they will retrieve the key and lock the other out for good. Bit now they have come full circle, recognise the brokenness within each other and reconnect over it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_177": "\none of the best songs\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_178": "\nI could be way off base but I do wonder whether this is yet another track about JH mother and her death.

So they've closed themselves off. Now \"behind the door,\" the protagonist asks this person they feel inclined to trust \"should I open it for you?\" As in, \"should I let this person in and put my faith in them?\"\n\r\nBut they are also reluctant. \"Are you Unforgiven, too?\" The Unforgiven is a term the protagonist gives all of those who have hurt them, creating the emotional baggage they can't seem to toss off.\n\r\nThe song doesn't seem to have a happy resolution. After deciding to unlock the proverbial door and let someone in again, the protagonist says \"I take this key, and I bury it in you, because you're Unforgiven, too.\" Ultimately they feel betrayed by the person they decided to let in, and have decided to lay to rest the notion of ever letting someone in again, along with the relationship.\n\r\nIf this song was autobiographical at all for James Hetfield, he must have moved past the feeling. He has a family he presumably loves and trusts. Or maybe he wrote it from the perspective of the person he was afraid of becoming.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_183": "\nIn my view and understanding of the song it is about a man who falls in love with a women who constantly betrays him every time he gives her a second chance. Every time he \u00e2\u0080\u009cturns the pages\u00e2\u0080\u009d he gives her another chance and starts over again with her. Also by \u00e2\u0080\u009csick and tired I stand alone\u00e2\u0080\u009d he means that everyone around him is telling him that she is not right for him but he stands there alone giving her another chance.\r\nAnother lyric in the song \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve felt what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known\u00e2\u0080\u009d describes how he has gone through heartbreak and the knowledge of what she had done and how she has wronged him. Through out the song it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem very clear but it actually shows how he forgives her 3 - 4 times until finally condemning her as \u00e2\u0080\u009cunforgiven\u00e2\u0080\u009d after coming to his senses. You can pin point his own revelation of his situation with the lines\u00e2\u0080\u009dshe lay beside me, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be there when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gone\u00e2\u0080\u009d this line is him realizing that she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fallow him no matter what he does and that she will always keep treating him like this. The part of the song \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe door is closed so are your eyes, but now I see the sun\u00e2\u0080\u009d is him clearly saying that he is not going to let her back into his life, and because of that he realizes that the happiness he had looked for in her is now revealed to him because she is not in his life. But then again dispite his realization he rethinks on his choice and wants to forgive her again, but as he thinks back to what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cfelt\u00e2\u0080\u009d and what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cknown\u00e2\u0080\u009d about her he realizes that he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forgive her anymore so he buries the \u00e2\u0080\u009ckey\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the supposed \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoor\u00e2\u0080\u009d with her memory. And thus declares her unforgiven. \r\nI was extremely stoned when listening to this song and I really understood every part of it, I got really emotional because I was going through the same exact thing that is described in the song. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not whatsoever stating that this is what the song is supposed to factually represent, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just giving my take on how I analyzed it to be.

At it's base there is someone he wants beside him and there are questions he is asking them. In conclusion  at it's heart this song speaks to the many forms of love and suffering... Death and forgiveness and ultimately it's about life and what that means for those who must live with it all.
