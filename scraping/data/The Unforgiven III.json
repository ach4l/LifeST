It's like, someone does what he/she likes and goes out to do it as best they can, and in their own way... and then get side-tracked following money (light of golden treasure) and then the frustration of facing his/her own mistakes and not having anyone else to blame but themselves...\n\r\nThe first unforgiven was the one unforgiven by society.\r\nThe second unforgiven was the one unforgiven by his/her mate.\r\nThis, the ultimate unforgiven, is the self-unforgiven... The one who can't forgive himself for what he's done...\n\r\nSo far Metallica are impressing me with a different sound than they had so far, and i have no oppinion formed. One thing I am tired of hearing is: Better than St Anger. \n\r\nSt Anger IS, musically, not as good as what metallica had us used to, but it must be heard in context. St. Anger is a public vent of all the poison in Metallica. You just watch the documentary (Some kind of monster) to understand that... The sound comes out crude and raw and unrefined just like a feeling. Just like a spontaneous punch.\n\r\nAt least that's my oppinion. And in that context, the whole album fits like a glove.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nAmazing lyrics... you can relate this song to so many things. Starting something, getting lost in the way to finally fall, blaming someone else or many for your mistakes, to latter realise that you haven't found peace within yourself and therefore won't be in peace with the world or with that person until you solve things within you. This time the unforgiven is oneself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nBorrowing from an important post from the \"Unforgiven II\" song meanings:\n\r\nUnforgiven: A child becomes a lost soul after being beaten down by the conformist society\n\r\nUnforgiven II: That lost soul is found by another. \n\r\nUnforgiven III: That lost soul is accepting responsibility for his/her part in his bitter life:\n\r\n\"How can I blame you\r\nWhen it's me I can't forgive\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nI duno if any1 else is noticing this or just me, but the intro of the song with the piano and esp b4 the guitar starts to play sounds exactly like 'ecstasy of gold' the tune that Metallica used to play before kicking off each concert from some western movie i think.

I believe its a fitting beginning, where the other 2 were building up unforgiveness towards others, this one is based in realizing that the faults actually lie within. Also another thing I noticed was that the 1st was in the third person while Unforgiven II was in first person. . . this song has parts in third person and parts in first person. Another interesting thing about this song is towards the end of Unforgiven II there aree lyrics saying \"the sun is shining through\" and this song begins with \"How could he know this new dawn's light\"  I believe by putting all 3 songs together you view this person's journey through life and self realization. He has let the nonacceptance of others allow him to become something he never wanted to be. . . a bitter old man. It would also be fitting that the subject was nearing the end of his life and he wants to go away without hatred in his heart. Also its clear that the subject of all 3 songs are James hence the lyrics \"That old man here is me\" in the first song. It is definately a pretty kick ass song and all 3 are great listening to them in order.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_18": "\nBefore I heard the song, i told myself not to carry any expectations in case I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be disappointed. I'm far from it, the transession from the piano, trumpet, guitar and drum intro is hauntingly beautiful and sends shivers up my spine and the hairs rising on my head and arms. \n\r\nAs for the song meaning, here's my 2 cents. \r\nThe first song was about a pariah's childhood and all the demons and negative experiences he encountered through his upbringing, inflicted by society and his parents.\n\r\nThe second song was about the pariah finding a person whom he felt he could share his burden to and they could provide him with the hope of being forgiven, as their reaction to his experiences would be free of judgement as they are \"unforgiven\" too. \n\r\nAnd this song is possibly about him accepting how he will remain unforgiven, unless he himself forgives all those who inflicted damage upon him. His present and his future are marked and influenced by the demons of his past. He realises that he can finally gain redemption through forgiving others, allowing him to let go of the anger, sadness, bitterness, resentment that continues to overshadows his present. \n\r\n\"How could he know this new dawn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light\r\nWould change his life forever?\r\nSet sail to sea but pulled off course\r\nBy the light of golden treasure\"\r\nThe first line makes reference to where the ballad last left off (Unforgiven II i.e.), He has past through the door and embraced the light. The light of a new dawn symbolising the hope of gaining forgiveness, fresh beginnings, rebirth of one's being spiritually, emotionally, and mentally. \r\nI like how the concept of his journey of his life is represented through the symbolism of the \"sea\". \r\n\"Set sail to sea but pulled off course\" makes me think he planned on living his life through the highs and lows of the waves (obstacles) he encounters along the way until the light of \"golden treasure\" inspired him change course. The light symbolising \"hope\", the \"golden treasure\" symbolic of the greatest treasure he seeks. Redemption. \n\r\n\"Was he the one causing pain\r\nWith his careless dreaming?\"\r\nI think he's wondering to himself if he, himself, is also guilty of contributing to the negativity that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accumulated over the years, through the decisions and actions he's made. \n\r\n\"Been afraid, always afraid\r\nOf the things he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feeling\"\r\nI get the impression that this bit is speaking of the person's life in general. How the fear of embracing his \"feelings\" (of whatever emotion) controlled his decisions, actions, life etc. not allowing him to be human. \n\r\n\"He could just be gone\r\nHe would just sail on\r\nHe would just sail on\"\r\nHe can either let his fear give him the courage to end his life (gone) or let it motivate him to fight on (sail on). The use of second person narrations (i.e. \"He\") suggests that he's speaking of the past, the person he once was before coming to acceptance of the circumstances of the present.\n\r\n\"How can I be lost?\r\nIf I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got nowhere to go?\"\r\nFrom here on, the narration used is first person, marking the circumstances of the present. To state the obvious he's unsure of what course of direction he should take in his life, only he hasn't made any plans to allow him to take action and move forward. He finds it a bit ironic considering he feels lost when he's not trying to go anywhere in particular, or achieve anything. \n\r\n\"Searched for seas of gold\r\nHow come it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got so cold?\r\nHow can I be lost?\"\r\n\"gold\", \"cold\", are probably just for rhyming, maybe he's lived his life striving for forgiveness, with the fire of ambition. But now, it's as though his flame of ambition for redemption has died out and left him feeling \"cold\" (indifferent, apathetic, despairing) after a few failures.\n\r\n\"In remembrance I relive\r\nAnd how can I blame you\r\nWhen it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forgive?\"\r\nHe finally realises he's unforgiven because he hasn't retuned the favour and forgiven those who have harmed him (this is what distinguishes/separates the \"he\" from the \"I\", the past frame of mind he was in to the new perception he has developed at present). His memories and the pain he feels haunts him, and he can only let go of this negativity until he forgives. You realise that when you forgive others, you allow yourself to be free of the pain and resentment you have attached to the things they have done to you. You finally let yourself be free of the weight of these emotions and feel redeemed. \"To err is human, to forgive is divine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\r\n\"These days drift on inside a fog\r\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thick and suffocating\"\r\nHe lives his life surrounded by a haze of confusion as to if he should forgive his demons and allow himself to let go, and it seems to consume every breath he takes.\n\r\n\"This seeking life outside its hell\r\nInside intoxicating\"\r\nI don't really get this but i think the quote 'This seeking life', He's speaking of the force that compels him to look for balance and peace, compared to inner state of his mind and emotions, that are like drugs, something that keeps weighing him down. \n\r\n\"He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s run aground like his life\r\nWater\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much too shallow\r\nSlipping fast down with the ship\r\nFading in the shadows now\"\r\nI'm not sure what this means either but \"he's run aground like his life\" makes me think his life seems to be stuck in the past. There's no sense of movement towards the future. \r\nHe believes he's \"sailed\" (lived) his life on \"shallow water\", shallow water could symbolise how he never really got anywhere, because he never managed to go further towards \"deep waters\", meaning he never really crossed any \"seas\" towards \"gold treasure\" (forgiveness). \r\nThe \"ship\" symbolising the ambition or the feelings that drove him to achieve his dreams, goals, or seek redemption has \"sunk\", \"he\" (his past persona) along with it. \n\r\n\"A castaway\r\nBlame all gone away\r\nBlame gone away\"\r\nThe experience of feeling \"lost\" has allowed him to remove feelings of blame and resentment he shifted on his perpetrators.

I see the Unforgiven's as an epic. The first one is about the beginning of a man's life. He's used, abused, and dropped by all others. He ages mentally beyond his years and regrets most of his life. Then in the second movement someone comes. \"She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again.\" It sounds like he hurt her deeply. The whole song seems like he took her in, used her like the world used him, buried the key in her, and then left her. He made her unforgiven as well. Then in the final movement he accepts the consequences. He realizes that its no ones fault but his own and that in the end the only one who is unforgivable is himself. Really epic work of art.

By the time that he realizes what hell he has brought upon himself, it's too late. He tries to repent, but no good comes from it. It is because of these things why he is set to live the remainder of his life alone, searching for something that will never come.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_37": "\nSeems to me as this person has been \"sailing\" (going to work, getting on with day to day life) for a long time, untill one day \"pulled of course by the light of golden treasure\".\n\r\nSince then that person have changed and his partner (wife, girlfriend, good friend) \"been afraid of his careless dreaming... been afriad... of the things he's feeling\" - partner is worried for him, because he's not what he used to be, as he's been \"causing pain with his careless dreaming\" - may be dreaming like he wants to quit his usual life and concentrate on that freshly found \"golden treasure\". And I think he does that as \"He would just sail on. He would just sail on.\"\n\r\nThen \"How can I be lost. If I've got nowhere to go\" that \"plain\" sailing (usual/normal/boring life) isn't taking him anywhere, so he got nowhere to go. He also now have \"Searched the seas of gold\" however to his surprise(\"How come\") that sea (different life, new things etc.)\"it's got so cold\". Then he says again that he can't be lost, because he's got nowhere to go - same old again.\n\r\n\"How can I blame you\r\nWhen it's me I can't forgive\" - he still can't forgive himself for what he's done/caused/what happened because of him (as he tells later.)\n\r\n\"These days drift on inside a fog\r\nIt's thick and suffocating\r\nThis seeking life outside its hell\"\n\r\nNow that he doesn't know what to do - he can't seem to find \"his thing\", that old \"sailing\" has turned into drifting on days in a fog (springs into mind a line from Master of Puppets (...drift on numbered days...)), which is thick and suffocating - seems like this hell/life he isn't enjoying (because he's seeking something new) will be with him forever.\n\r\n\"This seeking life outside its hell\r\nInside intoxicating\"\n\r\nHe seeks something new/better/different \"outside its hell\" - outside his usual life, because he's \"suffocating\" and \"intoxicating\" (may be reffering to drugs, alcohol), as if he's dying.\n\r\n\"He's run aground\r\nLike his life\r\nWater's much too shallow\r\nSlipping fast\r\nDown with the ship\r\nFading in the shadows\r\nNow a castaway\"\n\r\nHis life has stoped/changed dramatically, because \"water is much too shallow\" - water supports ship on the water, otherwise ship sinks. So with our person, water got too shallow and he can't sail anymore, so he became a castaway, his ship hit the ground and can't sail anymore, because\n\r\n\"They've all gone away\r\nThey've gone away\"\n\r\nThis is the crucial part - people who've been supporting him, thanks to who he was able to \"sail on\" (e.g. live) have all gone away and now the water became too shallow for sailing. This has been caused by his careless (selfish) dreaming, because he got attracted by that golden treasure, and in most books/films golden treasures represent greed and isolation.\n\r\nNow he can't forgive himself for what happened and is not blaming his partner, however he realises that it's all his fault.\n\r\nSo, make sure you don't ignore people around you, appreciate their help and don't forget about those who made you who you are when you find that \"golden treasure\" and you be ok.\n\n\n\n", "comment_38": "\nOk I am a big metallica fun and I came up with this little story based on the titles of metallica songs. the titles are in capital letters.\n\n\r\nI park my 2*4 and step out, home at last but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a FRANTC state thinking about my narrow ESCAPE. I get into the house and I drink some of my WHISKEY in a JAR but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ease the pain clearly caused by the THORN WITHIN. At this point even i know the only solutions to deal with the STRUGGLE WITHIN. In the SMALL HOURS of the morning I stare into the dark night and see ORION, but now is not the time to think about ASTRONOMY the pain is too much it feels like I'm TRAPPED UNDER ICE yet I cant seem to convince myself that its my fault, betrayed by who i thought was a friend and betrayed by THE JUDAS KISS now I go towards my bed in this old rugged house, how am I supposed to sleep in THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT after I shot him between the eyes and left him STONE DEAD FOREVER and at that point it felt like NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. I close my eyes and try to sleep hoping it will all just FADE to BLACK but THE MEMORY REMAINS clear to me that I will always be UNFORGIVEN and it worries me because the things i just did make me wonder AM I EVIL. This cant be I was raised right how did I turn to this BAD SEED I know what I did was wrong but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like I am on ANESTHESIA.\n\r\nI had lost my mind when I decided it was KILLING TIME, I ran around taking them all out high on drugs I believed I was the INVISIBLE KID and the opponents I took out one by one where DISPOSABLE HEROES. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep so I stay up looking at the DIRTY WINDOW and start to think maybe its time I DISAPPEAR because right now I am CREEPING DEATH at any point the cops and feds will be all over looking for me. For so long I looked forward to exerting my revenge but that day seemed to be THE DAY THAT NEVER COMES nothing hurts more than taking the life of your BROTHERS IN ARMS. The pain was too much yet still I feel like the HERO OF THE DAY and I decided not to think about what others thought of me after all to the one who I was revenging I would always be the perfect PRINCE CHARMING her LOVERMAN as was the case when she lived and everyone else called me KING NOTHING. As my nerves began to calm I remember what MAMA SAID about salvation forgiveness trusting in God and THE FOUR HORSEMEN but I will not pray to THE GOD THAT FAILED seeing as he let my loved one die she truly was MY FRIEND OF MISERY so I decide to live the rest of my life with NO REMORSE.\n\r\nKnowing my fate as I step into the bathroom that bottle of CYANIDE seems appealing but I will not give up I will FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. Arrested I find myself locked in a SANATARIUM because the cops couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any normal person could do what I did. The DEVILS DANCE is what they called it and maybe this is where I would spend the rest of my days on THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY. A brilliant mind I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve to be here but what i did deserves to be punished and that is SAD BUT TRUE. At this rate I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think even a priest can PURIFY my soul. I think of to myself POOR TWISTED ME but I decide to not have self pity because when it comes to who killed those men I will always be the ONE. From a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy RONNIE went on to become a killer and sometimes I would think SO WHAT right until the judge decided i would RIDE the LIGHTENING. I know I am SOME KIND of MONSTER but do I really deserve to die. The judge is not letting me off easy as he proclaims THAT WAS JUST YOUR LIFE and now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached THE END OF THE LINE. Alone in my cell I think it seems I have become THE OUTLAW TORN thinking about SUICIDE AND REDEMPTION what to do I cant let them kill me oh the STRUGGLE WITHIN talk about THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE. After a nights sleep I think maybe its fine after all TO LIVE IS TO DIE what is this THE UNNAMED FEELING maybe its time to TURN THE PAGE. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_39": "\nI'll make this as comprehensible as possible...\nThe \"lost soul\" in these songs is James\nThe Unforgiven is about a lost soul being beaten down by society, it talks about James' childhood and life until that point\nThe Unforgiven II is about that same lost soul finding another lost soul (James' wife probably) and how James feels is unforgiven in her eyes for what he's done\nThe Unforgiven III is about the original lost soul, still, he does not forgive himself now, this is probably about what occurred in the 90s for James, womanizing, temptation, drinking, drugs, and what happened with Jason leaving, and the events of Some Kind of Monster (documentary), and how he can't forgive himself\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_40": "\nIts not the first two...but i'm liking it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_41": "\nI believe this song is about social unacceptance.

He considered his life's trip to be straightforward, like a wavy sea, but a light of forgiveness lit up his path.

To outside people his life is hell, but for himself it's even worse, for himself it's toxic. \n\nHe's run aground, like his life\nWater much too shallow\nSlipping fast, down with his ship\nFading in the shadows\n=================\nHis life has gone downhill. Life is much too shallow for him. He is losing control of himself, thinking about it. \n\nNow a castaway\nThey've all gone away\nThey've gone away\n==============\nHe is now alone.

The person in the first song went through most of his life hated, and picked on. However, he kept dreaming of finding a way out, and he did.\n\r\nThe Unforgiven II:\r\nThis song I have already commented on about 30 minutes ago, but the person from the first song finds someone just like him, and he dubbed her Unforgiven II *too*. He thought that since they were both Unforgiven that she would relate to him, but he found disappointment when she betrays him. He kills her, leaving a key to happiness outside of this world with her death.\n\r\nThe Unforgiven III:\r\nAs the Unforgiven II had a line in it that said \"But now I see the sun, Now I see the sun, yes now I see it\", this song begins with \"How could he know this new dawn's light Would change his life forever?\" Once the person from the previous two songs killed the woman, he was pulle doff course with the dawn's new light. \"Set sail to sea, but pulled of course by the light of golden treasure\" When he killed her, he was pulled of course from obtaining entrance to \"heaven\", and is now sailing on the River Styx, aka he's in Hell, or his soul is damn to hell. Now he can never forgive himself for what he'd done to her, and he can't find the forgiveness he needs to get to the holy light. His vessel *his ship* runs aground and he goes down with it, which symbolizes his own final death. Now he is lost in hell, or limbo. But he'll never be able to forgive himself, thus for ever remaining the Unforgiven\n\r\nidk..That's my point of view.

They continued to search \"for seas of gold' which I think is a metaphor for looking for one thing that he thinks will make him happy, but ultimately he realizes that there's no such thing.

But when I heard this song I realized I was stupid and now I am a huge Metallica fan. Anyway, while the song is literally about a boat captain, it could easily apply to a person's life. The captain of the boat \"set sail to sea\" but got \"pulled off course, by the light of golden treasure\". This means that the man's life got off track when tried to reach some appealing goal (fame or wealth?). The captain is kind of brain dead, and is so oblivious that he doesn't realize that he is causing pain for the crew. He is so focused on the golden treasure that he sinks the ship and becomes a castaway that has to live with his mistake for the rest of his life. If a person focuses on the \"intoxicating\" dream without taking the real world into consideration, they can inadvertently hurt people and ending up brooding like this sad captain. He can't forgive himself because he knows it it his fault.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_79": "\nThis follows the previous Unforgiven's. The first ones about a lonely man mad at society.

Wow\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_81": "\nFirst of all I'm a huge fan of Metallica !!\nSecond of all, this song can have a lot of meanings: the lyrics allow a variety of interpretations. The interpretation that fits best for me is one that the protagonist is a person who's going through difficult things in his life (he's almost or possibly completely depressive), and he doesn't know how to change them. Verse by verse:\n\n\"How could he know this new dawn's life\nWould change his life forever?\"\nSomething happened in the protagonist's life that completely changed everything in his life. So he starts thinking that he couldn't ever know that that happening would bring so much difficulty to him.\n\n\"Set sail to sea, but pulled off course\nBy the light of golden treasure.\"\nHe was living the best way he could, and then (again), something that seemed harmless or really good for him (\"treasure\") brought a lot of bad things to him (\"pulled off course\")\n\n\"Was he the one causing pain\nWith his careless dreaming?\nBeen afraid, always afraid,\nOf the things he's feeling.\"\nThen when starts thinking about all his life, his starts wondering if every bad things are his fault, and if he acted differently or if he wasn't so afraid of himself and his feelings that his constantly trying to hide, everything wouldn't be so hard.\n\n\"He could just be gone.\nHe would just sail on\nHe would just sail on.\"\nWhen thinking for a solution, he tries to runaway of it all (\"be gone\"). But then he realizes all he can do is go on living.\n\n\"How can I be lost\nIf I've got nowhere to go\"\nHe has no idea of how he can solve all his problems (\"nowhere to go\").\n\n\"Searched the seas of gold\nHow come it's got so cold?\nHow can I be lost\nIn remembrance I relive\"\nHe starts reliving everything he's passed through, trying to understand how everything got so hard (\"How come it's got so cold?\"\n\n\"So how can I blame you\nWhen it's me I can't forgive\"\nHe can't forgive himself for wrong things he did.\n\n\"These days drift on inside a fog\nIt's thick and suffocating\nThis seeking life outside its hell\nInside intoxicating\"\nAll his days are a constant pain: when he's alone it's \"intoxicating\", and when he's with others everything is \"hell\". That is: whether he's thinking about his situation or trying to solve it, everything's just too harsh.\n\n\"He's run aground\nLike his life\nWater's much too shallow\nSlipping fast\nDown with the ship\nFading in the shadows\"\nSo he just starts drowing in suffering\n\n\"Now a castaway\nThey've all gone away\nThey've gone away\"\nEveryone's abandoned him. Here either people actually did it - they can't live with him anymore because they can't stand his state - or he just imagines that no one cares about him, or he simply doesn't trust anyone, so he feels abandoned.\n\nForgive me\nForgive me not\nForgive me\nForgive me not\nForgive me\nForgive me not\nForgive me\nForgive me, why can't I forgive me\nHe tries to forgive himself, and clearly he gets angry at himself because he can't do it, he keeps blaming himself for his mistakes.\n\nWell, there it is, my interpretation. It's a really nice song, too bad the lyrics are so sad in the way i interpret them. As I said before, it may have lots of different meanings, I just think the one I did fits correctly into the verses.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_82": "\nEverything about this song is great, although it's a little weird how they started the first two the same way, then switched it up.
