And yes, today is the same (if not worse) than 12 years ago when the album was released.  Anyway, I think this song is about society in the manner that nobody is free to be themselves anymore.  The only time we are truly individuals are when we rebel.  The way the world works, as soon as we are born, we are influenced by those around us to join the conformist, industry-ruled world we live in.  Even though it was a comedy, Number 2 in Austin Powers said it best.  \"There is no world anymore.  It's just corporations.\"  And given the lyrics \"What I've felt \r\nWhat I've known \r\nNever shined through in what I've shown \r\nNever free \r\nNever me \r\nSo I dub thee unforgiven\"  \r\nI just find that these enforce my thoughts.  \r\n\"What I've felt\"  -- deals with his feelings and emotions\r\n\"What I've known\"  --  Everything that he (and we) know that we aren't allowed by culture to disperse\r\n\"Never shine through in what I\"ve shown\" --We are becoming one big lump of crap...a big mass with no individuality.  This means that even though he's a person, it doesn't show, because he's a drone.\r\n\"Never free\" --Ruled by everything around him\r\n\"Never me\" --It's not acceptable in today's culture to be yourself.  (I say screw this and everyone who enforces it, but that's the way it is)\r\n\"So I dub thee unforgiven\" --He feels he's unforgiven because he can't find it in him to stand out so much that you'll recognize him in the basic group of lowlifes.  \r\nAnyway, this is what I think the song means.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nbest metallica song.  totally about how a child is controled and demanded to confrom and he regrets doing it as an old man.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nOK I know I'm a bit late, but here's what the song really means to me. \n\r\nIt is about a guy (him, you, me, anyone) who was never free to be himself. Instead, society forces us to adopt certain behaviours from the moment we were born. They tell us what's right or wrong, what's good or bad, whether legally (laws) or culturally (through the opinion of others). So the guy grows up and feels trapped and he can never escape from this prison. Then he just gives up. He doesn't care anymore and feels he might as well die right away since it's not he (the guy he was or could have been otherwise without all the social pressure he had to conform to) anymore who lives but some zombie who has had to live by society's standards. So in a sense, the unforgiven could refer to society as a whole.\n\r\nBut to me, the unforgiven also has a second meaning : himself. He is the Unforgiven because he can't forgive himself for not breaking free from all this crap and finding enough courage to be himself, to be the boy he could have been had he not surrendered to social pressure. Despite his vow to never surrender (that never from this day his will they'll take away), he failed. Then he gives up the fight, he feels old, and he feels his life is over (I don't think the lyrics litterally mean he grew old. That's just how he feels.) He feels there's nothing more to expect from life. (The old man then prepares to die regretfully) What's the point in living if he could never be himself anyway? For him it's too late. He can't forgive society for forcing its rules upon him, nor can he forgive himself for not having fought harder to break free from this when he was younger. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nThis song reminds me of the novel \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley.\n\r\nThe young boy learns their rules\n\r\nDeprived of all his thoughts\n\r\nThey dedicate their lives\r\nTo running all of his\r\nHe tries to please them all\r\nThis bitter man he is\r\nThroughout his life the same\r\nHe's battled constantly\r\nThis fight he cannot win\n\r\nThese lines from the song strongly remind me of the concept of the book - of living in a world where everyone is foolishly conditioned and \"drugged\" to think that everyone is happy.

So he begins to conform to them but is not happy about it \"this bitter man he is\" And altho he pleases them he holds his battle secretly but he cannot ever overcome them and ends up giving in. And they see that he has given in and doesnt care anymore. \"A tired man they see no longer cares\" And with the next lines \"The old man then prepares, To die regretfully\" He realizes that he went back on his word and gave in. He promised himself that he wouldnt and yet he failed to keep that promise so he prepares to meet his death \"regretfully\" because he didnt acomplish what he promised he would.\n\r\n\" What I've felt, What I've known, Never shined through in what I've shown, Never free, Never me, So I dub thee unforgiven\"\n\r\nThis is him explaining that he never practised what he ment to \"never shined though in what i've shown\" And  \"never free, never me, so I dub thee unforgiven\" Is where he finally talks about how he is trapped but also he gave up and he shall never forgive himself or the other that did this too him.\n\r\nThis song is probably one of my favorites and this is what I got out of it...

Yes, I'd say it applies to me also. Though my life is much different now and I control what I do and so on, back then it was pretty much as the song illustrates. It is a very emotional song for those who can relate to it, and in that sense, it will remain an epitaph to present and future generations. This, I feel is a homage to heavy metal in general as it reflects a socioligal need for the 'individual' to relate to to the constant angst of our times. The mainstream of music that remains an itch I can't reach, plasticates life and all its complexities. Long live metal!

He has so many feelings about the way things around him are going, but no one to hear it. As he grows into an older man, the pain is nothing short of unbearable and miserable.

I started at a Catholic school and I think my anxiety/depression has roots at that damn place.  I agree with whoever it was that said the song has to do with James' childhood.  His mother died from cancer when he was young, she refused to treat it because she had faith that God would help her.  So there is how religion ruled over her.\r\n\"New blood joins this earth, but quickly is subdued\"\r\nObviously another person is born into a religion as soon as he/she exists.\r\n\"Through constant pain disgrace, the young boy learns their rules.\"\r\nThat child immediately is having their life planned out just after birth.\r\nBasically the next stanza explains how his own will is being erased by the preachers and his parents (Deprived of all his thoughts, His will they'll take away).\r\nNow for the chorus...\r\nIt's meaning can be even more controversial than the verses.  I beleive its about how Christians are always saying \"that's a sin\" when nobody knows for sure what God views as a sin.  The boy is struggling to satisfy God but he keeps \"sinning\" no matter how hard he trys.  The kid feels as if God is thinking \"So I dub thee unforgiven\" and that he is doomed for Hell already, regardless of what he does during the rest of his life.  No good deed can save him from Hell.  He is \"never free, never me\" because he is a slave to society/religion.\r\n'They' refers to the preachers, 'His' refers to the main character.\r\n\"They dedicate their lives, to running all of his\"\r\nThe preachers commit their entire lives to unintentionally rule other people's lives.\r\n\"He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is\"\r\nThe aging \"kid\" is still trying to satisfy what different preachers tell him is right and wrong.  And \"he's battled constantly, this fight he cannot win\" kind of says the same thing.  He's getting tired of fighting his conflicting thoughts about what he wants to do versus what he thinks is the right thing.  Then he eventually \"prepares to die regretfully\", meaning that he gave up and feels like he never satisfied God.\r\nOR:\r\nThis might talk about how the Chief Justice of the U.S. is forced to make critical decisions for the country that he doesn't care to make, or that he is too old to care anymore.

It is talking about all of us who are born to this earth:\n\r\n\"New blood joins this earth\"\r\nA new child is born and with it comes the possibility of fresh ideas and new meaning.  How many of us have dreamed when we were children of being astronauts? Or discovering a new land? Or inventing a new machine? How many of us actually did it?\n\r\n\"And quickly he's subdued\r\nThrough constant pained disgrace\r\nThe young boy learns their rules\"\r\nHowever for most of us these potentials are never reached as the weight of the world bares down upon us and soon we are so caught up in the mediacraty of life living for the moment and not living to our full potential.\n\r\n\"With time the child draws in\r\nThis whipping boy done wrong\r\nDeprived of all his thoughts\"\r\nAny new thoughts and ideas are ridiculed and treated with distain by our peers until, in our need to fit in, we abandon the ideals of self and embraces the ideals of group.\n\r\n\"The young man struggles on and on he's known\r\nA vow unto his own\r\nThat never from this day\r\nHis will they'll take away\"\r\nBut even as this happens most of us vow to ourselves that one day we will break away, that they will never take away our independence of thought... that we will be our own person... our own boss.  How many of us actually succeed in doing this?\n\r\n\"What I've felt\r\nWhat I've known\r\nNever shined through in what I've shown\r\nNever be\r\nNever see\r\nWon't see what might have been\"\r\nThis is a lament of regret.  All of my ambitions, all of the things I have felt and known, I never had the courage to show them through my actions.  This the lament of an old man.\n\r\n\"Never free\r\nNever me\r\nSo I dub thee unforgiven\"\r\nI have lost my identity, I have lost myself in the sea of everyday life.  I am a failure unto myself... and so are you... so you are unforgiven because like me you have commited the sin of failing yourself throughout your life, and for being part of the problem.\n\r\n\"They dedicate their lives\r\nTo running all of his\r\nHe tries to please them all\r\nThis bitter man he is\"\r\nWe lack the will to take control of our own lives so others run our lives for us, while at the same time others run their lives for them.  It is so much easier to run someone else's life isn't it? We tries to please them all... we lack the will and are afraid to assert ourselves because these are the people we think we care about... but at the same time we are bitter because we knows what they are doing to us, but we feel there is nothing we can do to change the status quo.\n\r\n\"Throughout his life the same\r\nHe's battled constantly\r\nThis fight he cannot win\r\nA tired man they see no longer cares\r\nThe old man then prepares\r\nTo die regretfully\"\n\r\nAnd throughot our whole life nothing changes.  We battles in futility fighting a battle we cannot win. This song is very dark and perhaps wrong here because we CAN win the battle if we knows what we should be fighting. As things stand we are fighting the wrong enemy, we are fighting the enemy without while the real enemy lives within.  Our insecurties, our fearsour hates, our regrets - all of the things we cannot admit to ourselves are the real problem.  As we grows older it becomes more and more difficult to change that way of thinking. Jaded and old the we no longer care... we have lost. Society has beaten us down and that is the end. A sad end indeed.\n\r\n\"That old man here is me\"\r\nThis can be taken in two ways. Either the writer is saying he is a bitter old man, or he is playing the role of the old man in question.  If it is the latter little needs to be said.  if it is the former then clearly the writer feels hard done by, and that he has failed himself... but he doesn't care anymore.\n\r\n\"You labeled me\r\nI'll label you\r\nSo I dub the unforgiven\"\r\nYou have labeled me a failure because I have failed myself.  So I will return the favour since I am a tired and jaded old man.  I dub thee unforgiven.  This refers to the bestowing a title of nobility... except here it is bestowing a title of failure and imfamy... you are a failure - you have failed yourself, you have failed me... join the ranks of the unforgiven.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_112": "\nThinking about that line again:\n\r\n\"You labeled me\r\nI'll label you\r\nSo I dub the unforgiven\"\n\r\nAother more compelling conclusion could be reached.  I label you unforgiven because now I am old and tired and now it is my turn to continue the cycle. You are unforgiven because like the original sin you are another part of the whole mess and you cannot escape.  You cannot be forgiven and rise to your potential - just like those before you.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_113": "\nAmazing song, very easy to relate to like alot of the lyrics on the Black album.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_114": "\nits a very powerful song about abuse. the corus is awsome. i think that the most powerful part of the song is the solo, in my opinion. either way, this song is amazing\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_115": "\n\"What I've felt\r\nWhat I've known\r\nNever shined through in what I've shown\r\nNever be\r\nNever see\r\nWon't see what might have been\"\n\r\nI can relate to that as well, sadly.

A young man makes a 'vow unto his own' that he will never be taken away his free will, his free thoughts and his will to change the whole fascismic thing. As you can see in the video clip he manages to find a place where he cannot be watched by the government and think freely. However as he grows older and finally becomes old realises that all he has done was in vain because there was no one around him to express his thoughts to, as well as he did not manage to change anything about the system. So, thinking finally that he is one more man beaten by fascism, he dies sadly. Sorry but anything else said is not correct.

I think he'd rather fail/succeed/live/die/hurt/love/fight etc by his own two hands.\n\r\n\"Never free\r\nNever me\r\nSo I dub thee unforgiven\"\r\nThe painful and abusive experiences from his childhood and whilst growing up the things he was taught by his parents and etc will haunt him for the rest of his life. Since they were permanently tattoed into his mind with the most terrible experiences and memories ever.\r\nHe won't be able to be who he is completely until he is free of these burdans and the baggae he carries, which is where the \"Unforgiven\" concept comes in.\r\nBecause he refused to live his life the way others wanted him too, they won't accept him for who he is until he does.\r\nThus he is unforgiven . .just as I.\n\r\n\"They dedicate their lives\r\nTo running all of his\r\nHe tries to please them all\"\r\nHe's basically living his life for everyone else.\n\r\n\"This bitter man he is\r\nThroughout his life the same\"\r\nBecause he's unable to express his freedom, he truns bitter and starts to resent them. This cycle of living is always the same, no room for growth as he's always living by what others have taught him. He can't develop his own psyche, learn from his own mistakes/experiences etc.\n\r\n\"He's battled constantly\r\nThis fight he cannot win\"\r\nHe's tried many times to rebel and defy this \"control\" that the world has over him, It's him against the whole word and he comes to realise it's a losing battle that cannot be won.\n\r\n\"A tired man they see no longer cares\r\nThe old man then prepares\r\nTo die regretfully\r\nThat old man here is me\"\r\nHe's lived most of his life battling the odds and fighting for his freedom, now he's an old man, crippled and coming to the end of his days on this unforgiving planet. \r\nHe's reflecting on his life and what he's achieved and realises that the only thing he's achieved is pleasing others and regrets this because in the course of his lifetime he never got to really do the things he wanted to do in life the WAY HE WANTED TO. \r\nHe realises he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s achieved NOTHING because he ended up fighting all his life against the world, wasting his time in this losing battle, never really getting to live life at all.\n\n\r\n\"You labelled me\r\nI'll label you\r\nSo I dub the unforgiven\"\r\nHe feels hatred, anger and resentment and unable to find redemption, for what society his parents and the world has done to him. & as a result of that instead of learning from this experience and not doing what was done to him as a child to his own child, he does.\r\nI guess it's basically because it's the only thin he's known and has been taught, which is why he does what his perpetrators did to him to others.\n\r\nI find myself crying each time I listen to this song, because it reminds me of how stuffed up this world is and how people can be so cruel. . makes you wonder if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any hope at all. ..\n\r\nGod Bless everyone & I hope you are able to find peace with the demons of your past.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_131": "\nThis is on my list of top favorite Metallica songs, along with the second one.

I know what it is like to suffer from a childhood of mental/emotional abuse at the hands of my parents, and to never forgive them for it. While we are young, we are ALL defenseless, and for a parent who is supposed to love their child and nurture them to treat them in such insidious ways, it really makes you wonder about the state of our society. People know that all children are extremely impressionable, and their environment, surroundings etc. are basically the biggest factor in how their child will mentally and emotionally mature and develop. So many people are completely oblivious to this facet of childhood/parenting. If you mention \"child abuse,\" 95% of people automatically think of beating your kid, and nothing else comes to mind.

At this point even i know the only solutions to deal with the STRUGGLE WITHIN. In the SMALL HOURS of the morning I stare into the dark night and see ORION, but now is not the time to think about ASTRONOMY the pain is too much it feels like I'm TRAPPED UNDER ICE yet I cant seem to convince myself that its my fault, betrayed by who i thought was a friend and betrayed by THE JUDAS KISS now I go towards my bed in this old rugged house, how am I supposed to sleep in THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT after I shot him between the eyes and left him STONE DEAD FOREVER and at that point it felt like NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. I close my eyes and try to sleep hoping it will all just FADE to BLACK but THE MEMORY REMAINS clear to me that I will always be UNFORGIVEN and it worries me because the things i just did make me wonder AM I EVIL.

As my nerves began to calm I remember what MAMA SAID about salvation forgiveness trusting in God and THE FOUR HORSEMEN but I will not pray to THE GOD THAT FAILED seeing as he let my loved one die she truly was MY FRIEND OF MISERY so I decide to live the rest of my life with NO REMORSE.\n\r\nKnowing my fate as I step into the bathroom that bottle of CYANIDE seems appealing but I will not give up I will FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.

The lyrics are so meaningful. I love how Hetfield growls when the song's about anger and injustice, and then how it becomes so tender and melodious when the song's about despair or love. The guitar makes this song even more wonderful. \n\r\n\"Unforgiven\" is about damnation. According to Christianity, God forgave people their sins by giving us salvation through the sacrifice and resurrection of his son, Jesus. If not for God's forgiveness, people everywhere would all be damned to hell because we all sin and our sin would stain the spotless and perfect heaven. \"So I dub thee unforgiven\" is a reference to religion, and means that the man is dubbed as damned. \n\r\nThe man is condemned because he spent his childhood slaving after abusive people. Instead of appreciating his obedience, they took advantage of it, making him bleed (\"New blood joins the earth...\") and stripping him his will, thoughts, freedom, and individuality. His need to please to escape pain prevented him from breaking free and experiencing happiness. He pleases his abusers grudgingly (Never shined through in what I've shown). By pleasing harsh conformity, he never knows the freedom to be individual and happy for himself. (Never free/ Never me) (You labeled me/ I'll label you)\n\r\nHe becomes \"this bitter man he is\" because he bitterly regrets that he never opposed his oppressors who exploited his passiveness and stole away his freedom of being his own person.\n\r\nHe never felt the happiness of possessing that freedom. He can't forgive himself because of the bitterness and self-loathing for not fighting back. There is no happiness in hell, of course. When the man was a boy, he knew no joy, and as a man he still doesn't know much about joy.\n\r\nIt's a very sad song. It's true you can go deeper than what's on the surface and see this song as a long metaphor about the misery of current society, but I'd rather not do that. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_166": "\nGod Metallica are amazing! Yes, I'm a newbie to this great band - only discovered them recently. At first, I didn't see what was so great about them...but then I really LISTENED to them and now I love them! Amazing band! I can't believe Lamb Of God was supporting them in concert - in my opinion they play very different music, though they are both metal. But what is 'metal' really? Is it chromatic chords? Distortion on guitars? Guitar solos? Screaming? A lot of bands include all these things in their music and aren't considered 'metal'. Meh. Whatever.

The person's response is also like learned helplessness ... hopelessness and in this care - bitterness. I think this process can be seen in cults, some religions, and when children have disabilities and don't fit in at school.

But the meaning of this song is, loosely speaking, when James Hetfield was young (13 years ) his dad left his family, and three years later his mom died.\n\nHis mom's relatives were busy praying to God, and they never really took her to a doctor. James' mom + relatives were very religious, but God didn't save her at the end, as she died and left James all by himself -- without a mom or dad. \n\nThe song, in stages, explains James struggles in each period of his life. When he was young, he left his Science class because he was told do so by his religious mom and dad. They told James and science wasn't as important as God's powers, so there's no point in learning them. However, this wasn't the case with other kids' parents. So James was the only one who left the Science class, making him an outcast. This was very difficult for him, especially he was still young and trying to learn how to react to what other had to say about his obscure behavior. \n\nThat's just part of the song, there's much much more to it. \n\nBTW if you are interested in reading my full analysis, check out my blog: explorerockmusic.blogspot.com/2013/08/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_176": "\nAs person is born..He don't have a choice to select his path..The family, school and everything in life is governed by punishment, and force him to choose a path and a way of living.

To me, this song is about life. Everyone feels this song on some level because through out life we experience feeling oppressed and repressed. No one fully relates to anyone. To me this song is a contradiction to the saying that man is not an island. The song makes a credible argument that because we all experience reality differently, our curse is that we ARE in fact individual islands. It would be easy  to interpret this song as simply a description of going though life under a perceived oppressor, whether it be God or Government or Society. But I don't think it's any one of those. \"You label me, I'll label you\"  is a perfect example, good, bad, christian, atheist, liberal, conservative. Titles are oppressive, you find yourself trying to fit into a box. And after a lifetime of conforming to the titles, enforced or self imposed, we become bitter and looking forward to death. \"The old man then prepares to die regretfully\". \r\n     On a personal note, this song is beautiful and so is the video. This is not a popular topic and I think it really cuts to the marrow. One of those songs that kind of chokes you up, especially if you've been though stuff in life (and we all have). And maybe that's what they intended to be taken away from this song, the intimately personal understandings that we occasionally have we each other is our solace. To be able to feel on that level is all part of the curse and the blessing of being a cognitive organism.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_178": "\nJust based on the chorus, I really believe this is someone's final fuck you to everyone before they end their life.

This is a story, so if you can't imagine the meaning, I will take you through the meaning now.\n\nThe song opens with a dramatic melody, and allows us to know that this is a sad song, but not why.\n\nWith James's first vocals, we understand that there's a new life to earth. This boy doesn't learn the rules of life like a child with entitlement, but he learns life through punishment. He becomes the whipping boy of his masters. Never is he allowed to think for himself, but to serve.\n\nThen we reach James's beautiful chorus. What this boy has felt, thought, and imagined could have changed everything. All of the amazing things he dreamed were never shown in his actions, which makes this song even more sad, because we all have something more in us that we never show. If you know the history of Metallica, then you understand where the ties to his mother and religion come in(no, I'm an atheist, but that's where HE is coming from.)\n\nNext verse is his true submission. He tries to live up to his masters, thought he doesn't love what he does, and he understands that his calling is out there. He wants to go further in his life, but in his dystopian nightmare, they control his life. Towards the end of his verse, James tells us that this isn't a fictional character, but instead a biographical look into his own life.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_181": "\nThis song reminded me a lot of myself. In it, a person knows so much about the world, about people. However, they never knew how to convey it correctly. The person knows that he/she could truly make a difference, if they only figured out how to convey their findings and ephiphanies, correctly and effectively.\n\nThe daily, mundane life cycle gets to him so much in the second verse. It's heart wrenching. That verse gives me the motivation to get up and try to make a stance in this life. Having that sort of regret, portrayed in the song, scares me something fierce.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_182": "\nthis sounds vaguely like references to when Bernard marx and the girl with him visit the savage resort in Brave New World.  he labeled them savage and he never will be free because world state has an electric fence between them.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_183": "\nin my opinion this song describes my life down to the T. its no matter how much I try to help and please people I still get treated.
