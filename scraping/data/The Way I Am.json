What he's saying is that he thinks he's going to be crucified for trying to change the world.  The song is a brilliant metaphysical conceit and deserves recognition on that grounds alone.  Finally, it is not fame that Eminem is unhappy with, but really the state of the world.  If anyone tells me to go back to English class, I'll shoot them, because I am an English major.  BTW.  Rainbow, here's the dictionary definition of venting from Webster..  Vent vt. (transative verb)  2 -- To express; let out.  Humans have been able to express things for millenia, so it is certainly a human verb.  Alright, I'm done ranting.  Great song.  For those of you who are dead set against Eminem for being misogynistic, take a closer look at his lyrics.  He is a master of irony.  Irony in the literary sense that is.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI completely agree with thisboy about this song. Eminem is the kind of rapper that can rap about just about anything but his most of his songs have a powerful meaning. My favourite part of this song is:\r\n\"When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school \r\nand they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin \r\nWhere were the parents at? And look where it's at \r\nMiddle America, now it's a tragedy \r\nNow it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty \r\nhavin this happenin (this happenin)..\"\r\nThis, like all of his other lyrics, is one of those things that everyone knows but doesn't have the balls to sa in public. I have to tip my hat to Eminem for writing such a real and powerful song and having the balls to put it out.\n\n\n", "comment_3": "\nOh, and you haven't heard about venting?

If you want to buy his music u go out and buy it if you dont then you dont. why should his records be seperated from others because some people cant handle a bit of every day bad language. I agree with who ever said you should get out more because you do. You need to live a real life one which involves everyday stuff. Don't live your life thinking everything in the world is all sweet because lets face it it isnt, far from it. There is drugs out there, there is people getting beaten up and killed by others there is all that shit so face it!!!! and stop girning over a few sware words!\r\nthis guy is a role model for any white rapper out there so what let him be that he's basicaly saying yes i can be a role model but if you see me in the street doin normal stuff dont anoy me or pester me.\r\nhe's voicing the opinions of everyother star out there who are to chicken to say it themselves, no one wants fans crouding round them all the time when they are out having a meal and yet because this man voices this you all seem to think he's whining welll think again!!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nto all eminem: haters shut up!

I've only recently taken an interest in Eminem. Rap music would usually be my scene but I'm trying to be open-minded! :)\n\r\nHe's a really wonderful lyricist and rapper I've discovered though. It flows really nicely. \n\r\nI think he's one of the most influential musicians in popular music. I love the lines about the school shoot ups and Middle America. Really great.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_72": "\nI may not like Manson, but I definitely support him and Eminem especially since Columbine and all that shit, since people think I'm gonna bring a bomb to school or shoot everyone for being the only \"Goth\" In a hick/richboy town. Eminem has 'is moments, he's not the best but he's pretty kick ass. Not some \"Badass,\" And it's not really all that popular to listen to him anymore, for those of you who think people like me listen to him to stand out, or fit in. It's just talent. And I HATE most rap, completely, but he's poetic to no end. He makes it flow mindblowingly. It's not deep, it's amazing, truth, but not deep. It's way too blunt to be deep peoples, how can something be that basic, and blunt, and simple, but be deep? And yes, venting is a word Rainbow, you dumb fag lover. And he doesn't do anything for fame, if I didn't say that earlier. How could he expect fame? Among his crew, maybe, but across the country(ies?), I don't think he'd want that. All it does is fuck people over. Just look at \"Like Toy Soldiers\" (Also a great song), his friend died, and it was partially his fault. Not somethin that prolly woulda happened if he wasn't famous. Anyway, there's my .02c's, And sorry if it was repetitive.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_73": "\nto all eminem: haters shut up!

Instead, I believe he's referring to the shootings at Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, Arkansas. After all, he does say Middle America.

The whole Marshall Mathers LP album was way better than The \r\nSlim Shady LP. \n\r\nHe also said, it's a lot about that he is sick of people complaining about his style of rapping and what he \r\ncomes out with.

Yes Eminem's talented, and for the record, if you sound like an idiot while defending something, you ruin the case you're making.
