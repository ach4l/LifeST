I'm just getting into Frank, so I'm constantly being amazed.  Let me tell you this fellas...if you want girls, Frank's the guy to go to.  \r\nThis song is just so thoughtful.  Its the little things about the girl that gets him.  And even though change is coming, and most likely they wont be together forever...the time they share will forever be remembered.
