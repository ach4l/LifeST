It's a pure love song that doesn't sound like the same old drippy love songs.  \n\r\nWhen you find true love, this is the song you sing and \"get.\"  It's about the \"wonder\" of love, it can't be analyized, or explained, it just can be felt and that is wonderful.  When someone truely loves you, they love things about you you can't understand, but that's  love.  They realy get and know you.  They are your best firend.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nYour kiss to me is worth a fortune\r\nYour love for me is everything\n\r\nIts wen u really cant live without the person u love.

Thats why he sang it last in most of his later concerts.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nno words to describe my feelings when I hear that. Absolutely incredible.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
