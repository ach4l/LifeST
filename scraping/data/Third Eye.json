{"comment_0": "\nHello Everyone,\n\r\nThis song is not about drugs. It is an insult to this great band to imply that MJK is only speaking about drugs, drug use, and drug effects. This song is really about Quantum Physics. At the begining of the song MJK quotes Bill Hicks. He says\n\r\n\"Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.\"\n\r\nThis one paragraph is what the whole song is about. He is talking about the Big Bang. When all atoms in the universe where ONE atom. Then the big bang happened and created the universe. That is why we are one consciousness, because we are all one (originated from the same thing). By the way the man that realized this theory did not do acid, it was Albert Einstein. (Theory of Relativity)\n\r\n\"Prying open my third eye\" is not a reference to MJK's penis or his Peyote eye. The third eye in Buddhism is your consciousness. Your third eye allows you to see reality as it is, not the reality that we think exist, which is the reality we create in our minds that we see, taste, touch, etc.\n\r\nWe have all heard MJK refer to life as an illusion. Life is what our brain tells us what we are experiencing. When the Big Bang happened it not only created you, me, this planet, our universe, but it created all the parallel universes. Which means that if we are all one because we originated from the BIG Bang. Then that means that we all exist in everywhere, including other dimensions and so on. So, right now at this very moment you exist multiple times throughout space. That is why life is an illusion.\n\r\n\"So good to see you\r\nI've missed you so much\r\nSo glad it's over\r\nI've missed you so much\r\nCame out to watch you play\r\nWhy are you running?\"\n\r\nThis is also related to Buddhist philosophy. The principle of Reincarnation. He says the statement above several times throughout the song. The first, he is talking about visiting himself as a child. The second is him visiting himself from another life time. According to Buddhist Philosophy, when you die you do not take with you anything but your Karma. This means your physical appearance, your knowledge, your car, all of these thing do not come with you to your next life. That is why MJK says this,\"\n\r\nI stick my hand into his shadow\r\nTo pull the pieces from the sand\r\nWhich I attempt to reassemble\r\nTo see just who I might have been\r\nI do not recognize the vessel,\r\nBut the eyes seem so familiar\r\nLike phosphorescent desert buttons\r\nSinging one familiar song.\"\n\r\nYou can see who you were in past lives, who you will be, and even who others were. If you just open your third eye. \n\r\nIf you have time go to youtube.com and type in \"what the bleep do we know part 1.\" Watch the whole movie. It will thoroughly explain all of these concepts. We all see what we want to see. Just read through the comments, and see how people distorted MJK's lyrics because they wanted MJK to say what they wanted to hear.\n\r\nIf you are an avid TOOL fan, or if you know anything about TOOL. You know that they don't clearly state the point. Not because they are trying to be tricky. They want you to think for yourself. All of our lives we have been fed distorted information. We have been given answers to all our problems with the click of the search button on Google. TOOL doesn't want to give you the answers. They want you to find them on your own. Be pro-active learn the truth because you won't in school. Our governments, our dogmatic religions ( such as christianity, Islam, Jeudaism), and our teachers don't want you to know the truth because you begin to question. When you begin to question you begin to ask. When you ask then you act. This leads to revolution.\n\r\nI hope this comment helped open your third eye.\n\r\n\"Liberate yourself and you will liberate the world\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI think that this song is about someone(loved one maybe child) who has passed away. And the narrator is dreaming of their \"face again\" and In the beginning Bill Hicks is talking about how drugs can help. So this person has turned into a drug addict and is trying to stop but is brought back \"Down that hole and back again\"\r\nThis person is high to feel better and believes that he sees the loved one \"playing\" so he \"came out to watch you play\"  but him/her starts running away and the addict starts to cry and screams \"why are you running away!\"\r\nThird eye is a metaphor for finally realizing what is true/reality so the addict is \"Prying open my third eye\" so see reality and that he/she Is gone but thanks the drugs for letting the addict see the loved one once again.  And realizes that this entire time he's been \"Chasing a trail of smoke\" meaning the loved one was never there but he did it for \"reason.\" The reason is because he loved him/her. \n\n\n", "comment_2": "\nThe entire Aenima album is about Carl Jung's theory of Analytical Psychology.  This song is about the final layer, the center of it all:  The Self.  Just like \"Forty-six & 2\" was about crossing through layer 3, the Shadow.  And you'll hear Maynard mention \"Crucifying the ego\" in a few songs.  Eulogy was about \"Ego death\" which must happen to progress forward.  Ego is layer 2.  Look it up, I promise you it's true.  Maynard formed the word \"Aenima\" by combining \"anima\" (layer 4, the feminine soul within a man, and oppositely animus is the masculine soul within a woman, and it's said that the qualities of one's one anima/animus reflect that of the lover they should have.  It's kind of the basis for the concept of soul mates)  and enema.  Aenima is meant to mean \"A cleansing of the soul.\"  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nLike phosphorescent desert buttons \r\nSinging one familiar song... \n\n\r\nWhen he sings these two lines he is refering to the use of the halucinagenic peyote cactus that grows in parts of northern Mexico and the SW United States.

For instance one must not even consider talking back to your parents in certain manners when we are young, otherwise your gonna suffer severe consequences that result in pain. In our teenage years we begin to rebel against this specific type of conditioning, but subtler conditioning remains for the most part for us to function adequetly in society. A good exmple of those who loose or never develop the subtler conditionings are people with social dis-functions, people who are hard to get along with, are strange, or have neroutic tendencies...\n\r\ni know that seems a bit deep, but its to illustrate that there is a subconscious existence that continualy thinks about ALL possibilities that we shut off from ourselves in the intrest of effeciently handling our buisness and day to day survival, a human cannot afford to debate the meritts of EVERY footfall in intrest of actualy getting to his destination. What eventualy happens is we atrophy great portions of our links into our subconsciousness, many of them are no longer needed and may even hinder our abilities to function well, and many others are inadvertantly disabled that may very well be powerfull or fulfilling aspects of our innate inteligence.\n\r\nThis song is about the process of reuniting ourselves with our inner and subconscious layers that have been \"put in the closet\" for so long. At birth we are fully united with our subconscious, and only after years of training and social conditioning do we become seperated from our more primal urges and understandings... the second being more important.\n\r\nUrges are for the most part counter-productive or in-effeficient, however our subconscious understandings are beyond ingenious, the human subconscious s able to calculate the trajectories of hundreds of objects simultaneously just by seeing them, think about a kid playing football, most of his reactions are not higher thought, they are instant calculations done by \"instinct\", but its trained instinct isnt it? the kid manages for the most part to adhere to the rules of the game and to calculate the positions of 24 players and those players sizes weights speeds and physical stances, hes able to simultaneously tragect potential avenues of acomplishment, potential avenues of failure, the weight speed size and trajectory of the ball, and to carry out his mission in the best way possible, as in fighting for every inch.\n\r\nNow even if this kid sucks at football and gets sacked, his mind still does more advanced calculations from inherent understandings in less than a second than a trained physicist could calculate in several years of paperwork. \n\r\nNow imagine if you could tap into and unify your conscious and trained higher thoughts with that kind of instinctual comprehension?\n\r\nthis is the gateway represented by the third eye, the attempt to understand that which we already inherently understand, and to learn about things we already know, but to know them consciously. It is the ultimate unification of thought, and those who are able to do it can bend a huge amount of thought towards the world, hence the reference to all matter being nothing more than energy coalasced into a slow wave. Which by the way is pretty much true, matter and energy are the same thing in different states.\n\r\nThe process of opening up your mind to your inner mind is difficult to do, hence the \"Prying open my third eye\", ever try to remember something that was on the tip of your tounge? something you should just know of the top of your mind but your stuck? imagine that feeling but even more distinct, that is PRYING open your third eye, attempting to rip the shroud that clouds your ability to tap into that which you already have. This is also why there are so many references to dream like states and images, getting in to that true level of awareness is forcing ourseleves to awake from a sleep we arent aware were in, or should i say daze?\n\r\nDrugs have a long history in both recreational and medicinal (psychiatric) uses as being capable of spanning the divide between sub conscious and higher thought for limited amounts of time, although artificialy. The ability of tapping into that same connection without drugs is an even greater accomplishment, which i think this song is something of an attempt to discribe.\n\r\nRemember even the smartest of human beings only use 10% of their brain throughout their ENTIRE lives, and only a small portion of that is actualy your thought stream, if you could use all of your brain, well, youd be able to comprehend the depths of the universe MUCH more adeptly. This song is kind of an instruction guide for finding a true and lasting connection to your inner inteligence that cant be substituted by the briefs connections provided by drugs.\n\r\nThe references to rebuilding himself and to finding his hiding self all go back to the same connection... and if you look at many other tool songs, they are about the same tapping into yourself, lateralus and schism come to mind.... but those are less explicit and subject to opinion... this one is almost blatant.\n\r\nlook at this bit closely\n\r\n\"So good to see you once again \r\nI thought that you were hiding from me \r\nAnd you thought that I had run away \r\nChasing a trail of smoke and reason \"\n\r\nHis higher thought is of course greatly happy to find the lost connection to his inner mind, eespecialy after searching for so long for what seemed to be hidden, and in finding it, he realizes its always been there, and that he had left it, hence the subconscious's feeling that he had run away.\n\r\nin leteralus this topic comes up again \"over thinking, over analyzing, seperates the body from the mind\"... \n\r\nAn incredibly powerfull song that taps some deeper spots in me... maynard is certainly a genius, if only for his ability to reach through all the crap and try to tap into how and what we realy are beneath all the bullshit (training).\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_13": "\nI think the beginning of the song and the \"third eye\" could refer to the hindu god krishna.

Granted, drugs can help\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..sometimes, but it is usually a temporary thing....a peek through the third eye for a relatively short period of time. Maybe that is why TOOL is saying PRY instead of just OPEN. Drugs will get it done, but in a forceful and, in my experience, temporary way. I know many younger people won't want to hear it, but I urge you to spend 5 nights in a row meditating and writing down what happened after each session. You will be seeing shit just as crazy as your last boomer trip\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and before you know it, you can do this ANYWHERE, ANYTIME. To truly open the anja chakra would be something more powerful/significant than a temporary peek...I would imagine some of the members of TOOL have managed to keep that eye open, at least partially, most of the time. I believe this partly because of their association with Alex Grey. If you don't what Alex Grey is about....check out his art. You will understand from his painting\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.and it will be familiar to you if you have explored higher forms of consciousness....drug-induced or otherwise.

What I get from it is\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.a slow awakening to other possibilities...to higher states of consciousness...to a truth that has always been there, but ignored by most.

Maybe that's the curse of humanity, that through drugs or meditation we can discover the key to our existence and all of life, but we're still not allowed to know. \"Don't know, won't know, don't know, won't know, don't know, won't know.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_23": "\nI'm going to have to disagree with popular opinion here and say that this song IS about psychedelic drugs, at least in part. What it's NOT about is encouraging drug use.\n\nIn interviews, Maynard has said that while psychedelic drugs can help some people find inspiration and deeper meaning, this is only true if they prepare properly, have respect for the drug, and give themselves time to process the experience. He has said he knows dozens of people who used them improperly and, while not necessarily going insane, never quite came back from their trip. They spend so much time in their minds that they forget how to DO. \n\nThe problem is that psychedelic drugs allow people to achieve these states of consciousness without doing the work. Force them, in fact. Again, all of this is coming from interviews with Maynard.\n\nI believe this song is, at least in part, about this.\n\nI think the choice of words \"Prying open my third eye\" is very relevant.\n\nHe did not say \"Opening up my third eye.\" He did not say \"Peering out of my third eye.\" He said PRYING. This is a very violent choice of words for what should be a meditative, contemplative experience.\n\nMaynard has also always stressed the importance of the music itself, not just the lyrics, and this song has a very particular tone. It is perhaps their most dissonant song. It has a very aggressive, disturbing feel to it. The feel of this song is nothing like the calm, contemplative state of mind of, say, a Buddhist monk.\n\nIf we interpret the people that he meets as his \"other selves,\" I think that the line \"Why are you running?\" is again very relevant. This seems to imply that the narrator has no control of what is going on. In fact, everything about the song implies a state of confusion and unknowing.\n\nThe narrator hasn't opened his third eye, he's PRIED it open, and he's seeing things he can't understand.\n\nAgain, in interviews, Maynard has pointed out that psychedelic drugs allow people to achieve psychedelic states without doing the work to get there. I think that's what this song is about. In that sense, it's a lot like Rosetta Stoned.\n\nAs an aside, I don't think I'd be living up to my principles if I didn't add this:\n\n* Quantum mechanics is not about universal consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is nothing subjective about quantum mechanics, and it has nothing to do with consciousness. It is cold hard math. There is randomness in it, yes, but it's not subjective. Believe whatever spiritual/mystical beliefs you want, but don't conflate them with quantum mechanics. They are very different. I'm not being closed minded here. It's okay to believe in things that aren't or can't be proven. It's just not okay to call that science. *\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_24": "\nThis song, Just like 46&2, Jimmy, and Pushit are all about Maynard and Jimmy aka \"11\" becoming 1.Jimmy is frozen in time, waiting for maynard to free him by coming home(facing his past and changing) the whole cd is about change.

I started to go \"IN and OUT\" of the vision, and my face looked like it was withered and had spots of dew on it.  I didn't see a face that was blue, but it was shimmering at times.  This song goes with the rest of the album I believe.  He talks to his spiritual self.  When he's yelling, \"Prying open my third eye\" it reminds me of a beating heart.  Everytime his heart beats, his sprititual self tries to open his third eye, so he knows that the beating heart is only for the real world, and if he sees the spritual world, he will understand that the beating world is not important, or not as important as he thought it was, so he stops thinking about the beating heart, except then it comes back again and again.

The term \"Third Eye\" is a reference to the central point of every persons psychic abilities.  I don't know a lot about the Hindu teachings but I do know that the \"Third Eye\" is also a major part in Daoisim.  They refer to the eye being located in-between and slightly up from your 2 normal eyes.  Training and excersise gradually opens (not literally) the eye.  The more open the eye, the easier to see receive \"inner light\" and see inside yourself and possibly see \"visions.\"  But in the Daoism teachings they believe that \"visions\" and other such psychic abilities that are seen while opening your eye are evil and should be discarded and not pursued.  They use the eye to circulate Qi (pronounced \"Chi\") throughout the body.  I learned this from a 48 hours course I took with my SiFu while I was in Shaolin Wushu training.  Just some thoughts I figured I'd share about what I know about the \"Third Eye.\"  I'm not exactly sure what Manyard was referring to, but I'm most definitely certain that he is not referring to drugs.  Like most Tool songs, the \"drug\" meaning is just the facade that covers the deeper meaning.  Just some brain food for you guys to think about.

Some are like a musical mood ring, your mood brings out different things in them.\n\r\nAs for my interpretation:\n\r\nFirst off, \"Third Eye.\"  The title itself is of a non-physical feature..your Third Eye is the gateway to the astral, the beyond, alternate levels of conciousness.  During the song you hear the \"Prying open my third eye\" repeated many times.  At the beginning with the Bill Hicks bit, I would say that this ties in the use of drugs as a facilitator (prying open) to placing conciousness elsewhere.  Indeed, drugs can be used for such things.\n\r\nHowever, right after the Bill Hicks part, you hear the flowing white noise.  That is a binaural beat.  You put a tone in one ear, and a slightly different tone in the other ear, then the two halves of your brain are trying to listen to two different tones, which is difficult to do, and ultimately, they will work together to generate a third sound to your mind, which depending on the sounds and how it's done, can cause your brainwaves to change.  Commonly you have Alpha, Beta, Delta, Theta, with Alpha being alert/totally awake, Theta being deep deep sleep.  The idea is to use binaural beats to induce Delta/Theta levels of brainwaves while maintaining some form of conciousness...think of it like having a dream and you know you are dreaming.\n\r\nAnyways, onto the meat of the song.\n\r\n\"Dreaming of that face again, it's bright and blue and shimmering. Grinning wide...\"\n\r\nTo me that describes a non-phsyical entity, possibly someone deceased, but more likely someone that was known of before being born, or your higher self.\n\r\n\"A child's rhyme stuck in my head.  It said that life is but a dream.  I've spent so many years in question to find I've known this all along.\"\n\r\nThe guy who posted Row row row your boat wins.

It's beautiful.  Someone on the other side, waiting for us \"...glad it's over\" \"came out to watch you play\" and then \"why are you running?\" which I would guess is the fading back to being alive.\n\r\n\"So good to see you once again \r\nI thought that you were hiding \r\nAnd you thought that I had run away \r\nChasing the tail of dogma \r\nI opened my eye and there we were \"\n\r\nVolumes spoken in just lines.

Why are certain jokes funny to a high person only when they are high? Because of how they perceive it. Their perceptions of reality are different than a sober person.\r\n On a hallucinogenic, once again from my own experience, your perception of reality is altered immensely. You perceive reality as a different person, as who you REALLY are without the alterations to your person that you are normally acquainted with due to the everyday common thoughts of life. (Where can I get a job, how can I get a raise, where will I go to college?)\r\n Not only this, but you perceive things without expectation because you know that you COULD be hallucinating. So its like, 'well I'm not sure if anything about this object or reality is real right now, anything could be a part of my imagination' (Truly not much is as far as I'm concerned) so you really do perceive those objects and that reality in an incredibly different light.\r\n However, though I mentioned that you do not need to use a hallucinogenic to understand this song I was speaking truthfully as far as my experiences. But I will also say that I can DEFINITELY relate to and appreciate this song so much more because I really understand the, for lack of a better word, connotations of the things Maynard is describing.\n\n\r\n By the way, I really believe that hallucinogenics are fantastic if you use them wisely and intelligently. It should be iterated that these kinds of drugs really are not meant just to get 'fucked up.'

(their are books available on this subject)\n\r\nThe relative nature between lsd and the song I think holds in the fact\r\nthat lsd can help you in the stages to open your third eye. By taking lsd\r\n doesn't ensure you will open your third eye to see the other realm.\r\nBut it can help to put you in a frame of mind for you to furthur meditate and \r\nexperiance what the song is talking about.\n\r\nI have taken strong lsd and have seen the visualizations that appear real but\r\nare only the brain opening up and using different paths.  If you were to successfully\r\nopen your third eye you would see the rather large difference.\n\r\nAnother drug to help is DMT.\r\nLike LSD but often more intense. \r\nSince it is not taken by mouth, \r\nthe effects come on suddenly and can be overwhelming.\n\r\nThe term mind blowing might have been \r\ninvented for this drug.

Eating acid isn't hard to do, and it will change your views of the world.  Does that sound like prying it open, breaking its iron-fisted viselike clamp, forcing duality upon you?\n\r\nTo PRY open one's third eye is to use all your strength and make it open, to jam a crowbar into the crack and break the seal that makes you think that this exists, the seal that makes you think that this frail, lusty, fragile meat is actually who you are.\n\r\n\"...the eyes seem so familiar, like phosphorescent desert buttons...\" obviously points out the metaphors that are drawn between the experiences of mescaline and those of actual opening of one's third eye, and the penetration of the veil of reality.

I am of the opinion that to truly understand and receive the full experience of the music, particualrly Aenima, Lateralus and Salival, then you must listen to them while tripping at least once, and odds are the experience will better you.

I say dormant because like the Tim Leary quote from the beginning of the salival version (Tim Leary being the motivating force behind the introduction of LSD and pscilocybin to society in an effort to bring on a transcendental experience), our strucure for reality is generally based on values taught (informing, forming in our mind), not values seen.  Essentially, hallucinogens awaken a part of our thought process that is normally ignored, as it needs no use if structure and language are given by a source of authority instead of found.  By taking a hallucinogen, you remove that structure, and are forced instead to define things in terms of a new structure, all at once wiping away all of the mistaken or added implications and assumptions of the previous system while replacing it with a system that makes fewer or no assumptions. It sounds kind of complicated, and once again, you have to really experience it to fully grasp the implication.\n\r\n\"so good to see you once again, I thought that you were hiding from me\" \r\nthis line (and its analogs) is written from the point of view of truth (or, as it boils down to the same thing, the physical drug) calling to him or perhaps more correctly the promise of a system that is best applicable for the individual.  the mention of dogma and reason are references to the structures that are in place and in a sense obsolete (chasing the trail of smoke and reason, chasing the tail of dogma).  It is forgotten that existence is independent of the concepts we give to it, and that any dogma or doctrine or structure is necessarily derivative of the world around us, not the other way around.  The drug serves to open the door to those kind of realizations.  \r\nPhosphorescent desert buttons = peyote, a mescaline bearing cactus\r\npulling the peices from the sand. . . this scene is in a sense a tribute to the renewal that hallcinogens bring - while they rip away the old structure, they replace it anew through discovery and realization, the pieces in the sand represent the shattered remnants of the old system, and when placed back together they form an image that is both the same and different from the original (I do not recognize the vessel, but the eyes seem so familiar).  The vessel is simply the recreation of the shattered pieces, and is a metaphor for himself, in that we are all vessels, waiting to be filled with structure and knowledge and the old one was destroyed and repaced and refilled anew. In essence, we are allowed to find the flaws and misconceptions in the old system through this process of restructuring, eliminating them and evolving the way we think.  The crow is the symobolic representation of the messenger quality of the drug, in that it brings the message that there is no message beyond what we create, that anything is conceivable, but only after the process of renewal.  Beyond that, the song is essentially a tribute to the potential of the hallucinogenic experience and what it can allow us to acheive, particularly in sweeping away the illusions that limit and pervert our understanding of reality.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_119": "\nOh yeah, and just a little finishing point here, it is important to realize that while the song is in essence an homage to psychadelics, it also carries with it the implication that they are merely the first step, a shortcut to opening your third eye without the tedium and discipline of meditation, or the necessity of being indoctrinated into a system such as buddhism or hinduism that allows this kind of introspection.  It must be remembered that although this seems like the fast and dirty way to get something done that can be acheived without drugs (and it is possible to acheive these things without drugs), a persons access, particularly in our society, is limited in things such as a guru to guide you, or the time and committment to be able to break away from survival (obligations) long enough to acheive something through those methods.  To put it in perspective it may take a guru 50 years to acheive what one acid trip whlie listening to Tool could produce.  It must also be realized that the drug can develop interest in persons who previously had no idea or exposure to an eastern sense of reality and the concept of nirvana, or total peace with ones reality.  Once the thirst has been developed to a certain extent, the drug loses both its importance and its ability to change.  To deny that the song is about the potential of hallucingens is to blind yourself to the entire possibilty that Tool represents, and to deny that possibility is to denounce the band itself, as the band carries a very strong message of both evolution and improvement, and the ability to define things in terms of your own judgement and not others -to deny the possibility of drugs is to remain within a certain structure that places a stigma on drugs and not evolve into a new, more applicable structure.  Perhaps the reason why the drug is illegal is because of its unique ability to allow one to renounce outside authority for an interior one. . . .After all, every experiment Leary ever did with LSD while a professor at Harvard produced beneficial results - look up the research, its all published.  AND HOW CAN YOU IGNORE THE HINTS? Tim Leary, the father of the hippie movement, largest distributor of LSD the world has ever seen, has a space talking about this very thing at the beginning of the salival version, not to mention bill hicks from the aenima version ranting about the benefits of drugs.  How can this not be a central theme to the song when these quotes were purposefully included?  What other purpose can these quotes possibly have, than to bring out the point that drugs posses in them not just the capability for evil, but also good, making them two-sided, in essence a tool, much like the band itself is a tool for self improvement, should you be able to decipher its meaning.  Trust me, to deny the hallucinogenic aspect of the music is to rob yourself of the full meaning, making what should be a quick and relatively painless process of self betterment (and through self betterment the betterment of society at large) into a struggle to interpret that which cannot be interpreted in the context of our traditional systems, but which requires a new structure or system to comprehend.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_120": "\nCuban711 in refrence to your hindu connection to the third eye. \n\nangelfire.com/sc3/1010/\u2026\n\r\n\"The author believes a circular magnetic field that forms in the frontal portion of the brain in them acts as the hidden third eye, which receives and transmits a kind of radiation that probably lye outside the range of known electromagnetic radiation spectrum.\"\n\r\ngood read let me know what you think.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_121": "\nHas anyone ever seen the amazing Parabola video it links in with the theory of the third i think\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_122": "\none of the greatest songs in the world and one of my personal favourite tool songs. the live version of this song on the 'Salival'  album as it features maynards personal opinion at the beginning of the song 'think for yourself question authority' but the aenima version is also brilliant as it features bill hicks rantings at the begining (rest his soul) who the aenima album is dedicated to.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_123": "\nmeditationiseasy.com/mCorner/techniques/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_124": "\nmeditationiseasy.com/mCorner/techniques/\u2026\n\n\n", "comment_125": "\nI dont know if you all realize this, but Maynard isn't really into drugs.

This is shown through when he is dreaming of himself with the third eye and then he talks of how the eye is falling away from him.   Then when he \"wipes the webs and the dew\", he has taken some sort of hallucinogen and his eye is reappearing.  Then the lyrical absence represents meditation.  Once he has finally achieved the full reopening of his third eye, he begins to relay to the audience his experiences through the spoken word.  When he sings \"so good to see you...\" he is speaking from the eyes of his third eye.  Then, when his displays internal duality, he is speaking from the role of the self and the third eye.  When he talks of \"dogma\" and \"smoke and reason\" i do not think that he is simply refering to physical reality but also the belief that drugs are the only way one can have the ability to see the true self and glimpse the third eye.  By him saying that he is prying open his third eye, he is obviously saying that it takes more than a simple pill to truly see the third eye.\n\r\njust my comment.\n\r\nCant wait for the new CD next year.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_127": "\nThere are so many different interpretations of this song... noone's really seems perfectly right to anyone else, I don't think.

This has earned it the nickname the \"third eye\" The pineal gland's exact use has not yet been accurately discovered, but it is a fact that when stimulated it produces the drug, dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Which has been used by many ancient cultures and civilizations throughout central american, as a very powerful hallucinogen. some consider the trips more intense then acid.  Scientists have not yet proven if it is true, but it is believed this gland, and the drug DMT, play a role in everything from dreams, to out of body experiences, to alien encounters.  When people meditate, and experience visions, it is likely they have found a way to stimulate the pineal gland, and produce DMT, therefore prying open their \"third eye\" .. so i guess the point of all this is, like someone said before, Maynard is not a hardcore \"stoner\" so perhaps what he is referring to is the stimulation of our \"third eye\", since he does seem to be quite a fan  of sacred geometry, states of altered consciousnesses, and such..... who knows, just a thought... probably way off knowing the way he thinks lol..\r\nAnd sorry if none of that made sense its my first post\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_139": "\nIm suprised no one has mentions this but has anyone read the yaqui way by carlos castaneda.

In New Age spirituality, the third eye may alternately symbolize a state of enlightenment or the evocation of mental images having deeply-personal spiritual or psychological significance. The third eye is often associated with visions, clairvoyance, precognition, and out-of-body experiences, and people who have developed the capacity to use their third eyes are sometimes known as seers.\n\r\n     According to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings, called Western Wisdom Teachings, there are in the brain two small organs called the pituitary body and the pineal gland. This last gland is also called by medical science as \"the atrophied third eye\"; however, these teachings describe that none of them is atrophying: the pituitary body and the pineal gland at the present time are neither evolving nor degenerating, but are dormant. It is said that in the far past, when man was in touch with the inner worlds, these organs were his means of ingress thereto, and they will again serve that purpose at a later stage. According to this view, they were connected with the involuntary or sympathetic nervous system and to regain contact with the inner worlds (to reawaken the pituitary body and the pineal gland) it is necessary to establish the connection of the pineal gland and the pituitary body with the cerebrospinal nervous system. It is said that when that is accomplished, man will again possess the faculty of perception in the higher worlds (i.e. clairvoyance), but on a grander scale than it was in the distant past, because it will be in connection with the voluntary nervous system and therefore under the control of his will.

I view Maynards lyrics from a Hindu Philosophical perspective. I see he is expanding his consciousness through transcendental meditation. An awakening of the seven cerebrospinal chakras ascending the human body from the coccyx to the medulla oblongata. Its interesting to note that in 'pushit', he goes down a hole and we hear at the beginning of the song the sound of 'violin' honeybees. This is the first sound one hears as the manifestation of the aum vibration present within all of creation, when the first chakra at the base of the spine is awakened. Each Chakra has a different distinct maifestation of this sound as you ascend in consciousness. Its not always a direct ascension, but an up and down motion, kinda like playing a musical instrument. In and out. Pushing and pulling.\n\r\n   The other neat thing I noticed in this \"Third Eye\" song is his comment about a grinning blue face with three eyes. Krishna is often seen in Hindu mythology as a 'face' of the creator, and he has a blue face. He is considered the \"Christ\" of the orient. He is the one who re-introduced the world to the techniques of yoga that can enlighten mankind. The next step of spiritual evolution for humanity. Realizing that this is the dream realm of the Creator, and that as such we share His consciousness, only divided from each other by delusional ego and outward illusory sense dependancy.\n\r\n  'Blue is our new second sun' refers to the vision one sees when the 6th chakra is awakened. Its the third eye (Ajna Chakra) opposite the medulla oblongata between the eyebrows. The 'eye' is a blue sphere, circumscribed by a golden halo. At it's center is a bright five pointed star. It's through that doorway that we can communicate with our higher self. The same God that lives inside us all.\n\r\nThis whole album and a lot of Maynards works in Tool and A Perfect Circle are (to me) one man's journey of enlightenment, and all the frustrations and joys that come with it. \n\r\nGreat job, Maynard!

I think I understand clearly what Maynard is talking about.  Currently I am reading a book that each page feels more and more like the mind of Maynard.  I can tell he has read and thumbed through this book more then once.  This book has many words and ideals that match a handful of Maynard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s songs.  Book is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cAwakening The Third Eye\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Samuel Sagan.\n\r\n\tFirst Line; shrouding means to conceal, protect, or screen.  I think he is talking about living without the Third eye and how it is concealing what he could become in his world.  He is starting his meditation.\n\r\n\tSecond Line; Crow is a symbol for death and used with the word Holy it becomes a messenger.  He has come to help him resurrect his former self.  Also during meditated messengers (good or evil) come to contact you.\n\r\n\tThird Line; Maynard is talking about when you are young you experience life through your third eye.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there but like they say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use it you lose it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  He is trying to remember how to open it but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember. (Trying to reach Astral Space during meditation)\n\r\n\tFourth Line; if you read the book, it talks about when meditating you enter the astral and/or astral space you see colorful light (Any color but majority of the time \u00e2\u0080\u009cPurple\u00e2\u0080\u009d).  I think in this line is where he starts the meditation and enters astral space.  Seeing a new world that comes in blue.\n\r\n\tFifth Line; He reaches out to this the holy crow to hear its message.\n\r\n\tSixth Line; taking that information, he tries to rebuild his former self. See what he once was.  Sand is used a lot in reference to time.  He looks to the past to rebuild what time has eroded from himself.\n\r\n\tSeventh Line; Same, he wants to figure out who he use to be and attempts to pull the past from his memories\n\r\n\tEighth Line; He looks into his former self and it seems so unfamiliar and realized he has changed.  Think about our bodies as vessels that carry our souls.  When you awaken your third eye your soul leaves your body for a short period of time.\n\r\n\tNinth Line; he knows it was once him because the eyes resemble himself even when the vessel is no longer recognizable.\n\r\n\tTenth Line; Maynard talks about how his eyes stand out above everything else, like a white dot on a black background.  Your Focus goes towards the white dot, drawing you in.\n\r\n\tEleven Line; His former self then communicates in a way that seems too familiar as if he can remember.  Trying to regain lost memories from the past. Comparing himself to the old self.\n\r\nI recommend reading the book, only if you like spiritual journeys.  Also if you want to take a look at a small path Maynard has adventured too.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_193": "\nto me this song seems like it is referring to someone's lives being a series dreams and each dream he has he is re-incarnated.

Just beause it is like asking the question, \"What would actually happen when we do reach that 'next level' in evolution?\" Tool explains this through a simple news program like it's something that can just be shrugged off as 'fluff news'.\n\r\n\"Today, young men on acid realize that all matter is merely condensed through a slow vibration.

Life is only a dream in which imagination of ourselves.\"\n\r\n\"Here's Tom with the weather.\"\n\r\nHaha. Like it's nothing.\n\r\nCoincidentally, this idea of a, \"war on drugs\" started in the sixties. Where a Harvard Professor, who was studying the effects of LSD on test paitents affected by Schizophrenia, by the name of Timothy Leary told every kid in America to do drugs, specifically LSD, because of the \"great high\" that a person can get off of it. He tried it himself. The dude was (or still is, I'm not sure if he's dead) a nuttcase. Anyway, this inevitably brought on the hippie generation.\n\r\nActually Nixon said, \"Timothy Leary is the most dangerous man in America.\" We all know Nixon hates hippies.\n\r\nRemember that this was in the 60's, the closest time we ever used a mass nuke attack (Cuban Missle Chrisis) so saying something like this, instead of Soviet Russia, really ment something.\n\r\nAlso, I think it's worth mentioning the current \"Tool\" band of this era, The Doors. Who, much like other major rock bands of this time, frequently delved into the wonder drugs. In fact, the name, \"The Doors,\" originally came from a book called, \"The Doors of Preception.\" In this book, Aldous Huxley (author and also a professor) explains that in order to reach a higher preception of mind, one must dabble into drugs in order to do so.\n\r\nWeird, eh?

It allows you to tie all the other songs together. Images of enlightenment, awakening, etc are seen throughout the entire album, its easy to see once you've read up on the right material. The 'you' in this song is Maynard's inner child which he is also talking about in jimmy. Also, because of the nature of the lyrics and the fact that I have dabbled with hallucinogens, I would tend to say that Maynard's awakening would have been drug induced..... Another reason I think this is because of lost keys (Blame Hoffman) and Rosetta Stoned... (read up on them.) Aenima, Lateralus, and 10,000 days are all, in my opinion about enlightenment, opening your third eye, and going against the 'norms of society.'

I don't want to argue with anyone here by claiming or blasting that this song is about third eye in Buddhism. But, your interpretation about the third eye and the cycle of life is almost correct. What I would suggest is please keep on thinking on this. Search about it. You will always fall on the right path if you think for yourself. \n\r\nWhat's wrong about everyone here is stating that Buddhism is a religion. It's not religion. Buddhism is a Philosophy. Lord Buddha never asked us to forcefully follow whatever he said. He always have mentioned to always think for yourself before believing whatever you heard saw or sensed; even a thing Lord Buddha said. It's obvious that some will not accept a revolution. Because everyone's cold and lazy. They'll always make statements to justify their foolish beliefs.\n\r\nStaying without harming others is fine. But it won't help you with anything. It's like staying away from the road while all the vehicles go by.you won't ever cross it. You won't fall into trouble. But you'll just be there like a potato. It's up to you to decide whether to try find a way to cross it. By this I'm not saying to harm anyone or yourself. And Buddhism doesn't say find your own way either. Because Lord Buddha has told the right way -this is called \"Buddhism\" (because he took the decision to find a way to cross it)\n\r\nI'm not here to market Buddhism not to make any argument either. I'm posting this comment so that atleast someone will try to think for themselves laterally (Lateralus) and help themselves find a liberation out of this never ending cycle of life and death.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_261": "\nThe name says it all\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_262": "\nMusically, one of the greatest Tool songs ever.

Atleast to me.  But like most of tool's songs it is open to almost any interpretation.  I'll attempt to explain my view on the song by breaking down the song:\n\r\n\"Dreaming of that face again\r\nIt's bright and blue and shimmering\r\nGrinning wide\r\nAnd comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes\"\n\r\nHere, tool is describing what it is like after death to be reunited with \"god\".  Some other names for it may be the oversoul, one conciousness.  It is himself.\n\r\n\"On my back and tumbling\r\nDown that hole and back again\r\nRising up\r\nAnd wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye\"\n\r\nOn my back and tumblind down the hole refers to life.  And as he dies he is wiping the webs from his withered third eye that was closed while he was alive, but is open again now that he is dead and reunited with god.\n\r\n\"In... (of life)Out... (of life)In... (of life)Out... (of life)In... (of life)Out... (of life)\"\n\r\n\"A child's rhyme stuck in my head\r\nIt said that life is but a dream\r\nI've spent so many years in question\r\nto find I've known this all along\"\n\r\nHere he is saying how he has spent so many years during his life in question about existence to find out that, now that his third eye is open once again that he is reunited with god that he has known this all along.\n\r\n\"\"So good to see you\r\nI've missed you so much\r\nSo glad it's over\r\nI've missed you so much\r\nCame out to watch you play\r\nWhy are you running?\"\n\r\nthe soul is saying how good it is to once again be reunited with god.  but alas, he must live once more.  why are you running away, god?\n\r\n\"Shrouding all the ground around me\r\nIs this holy crow above me\"\n\r\nas he is reborn the holy crow, god, is closing his third eye.\n\r\n\"Black as holes within a memory\r\nAnd blue as our new second sun\r\nI stick my hand into his shadow\r\nTo pull the pieces from the sand\r\nWhich I attempt to reassemble\r\nTo see just who I might have been\r\nI do not recognize the vessel,\r\nBut the eyes seem so familiar\r\nLike phosphorescent desert buttons\"\n\r\nhe is trying to remember who he was in a past life.  it is not himself, but yet it is so familiar.\n\r\n\"Singing one familiar song...\"\n\r\nand as his third eye is opened again....\n\r\nthe rest of the song is basically repetitions except for two lines:\n\r\n\"Chasing the tail of dogma\r\nI opened my eye and there we were\"\n\r\nit is the way it has to be, the cycle continues.\n\r\n\"Chasing a trail of smoke and reason\"\n\r\nstill, it continues.\n\r\n--\n\r\nthat is what i got from the song anyway.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_268": "\nI could analyse the shit out of this song. But I'll just give you a little taste of what it means to me. The song is obviously very heavily influenced by psychedelic drugs and it describes the effects of tripping; feelings, hallucinations etc. \n\n\r\n\"Dreaming of that face again\r\nIt's bright and blue and shimmering\r\nGrinning wide\r\nAnd comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes\"\n\r\nI think is describing an entity, maybe a god,  the spirit of a psychedelic drug. It's three eyes mean it's enlightened and it is embracing a new psychonaut on the path to enlightenment.  \n\r\n\"On my back and tumbling\r\nDown that hole and back again\r\nRising up\"\n\r\nThe act of laying on the floor in darkened room while on psychedelic substances.
