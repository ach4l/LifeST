Add the repetitive lyrics to it being played 10 times on the radio in under an hour and you get an endless amount of \u00e2\u0080\u0098thunders\u00e2\u0080\u0099\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI thought that this song was 100/100. Catchy, good harmonies, cool lyrics. I'm not the #1 fan of Imagine Dragons but I'm a really big fan of this song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nHe rebels (he fit the mold to be a rockstar/singer) and sings.  He's not a sheep and follower.  He always dreamed he'd become a big star but his classmates didn't believe in him.  But he was more illuminated than he classmates who criticized him ever thought he was and he really did make it as a big star.  \n\nThen he was the one on stage with \"the last laugh\" while they were in the front seat of his concert (instead of him being in the back seat of the class).\n\nP.S. And maybe some Illuminati kisses (the good-intentioned Illuminati, not the fake bad-intentioned one)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
