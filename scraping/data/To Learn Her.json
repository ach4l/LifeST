{"comment_0": "\nThis song is about things guys should know about women, of course. I like this song because Miranda's telling guys what to expect from women. And, it is so true. But, let's get the lyrics right.\nFirst, these are the Google lyrics we all find. But, when you edit it, this will make more sense. \"You'll be true and you'll be tride\". Shouldn't it be, You'll be true and you'll be tried? Then, \"If you take her, you might hate her, and be left with just a ray\" How about, If you take her, you might hate her, and be left with just a ring.\nListen to the song and tell me this isn't what she means. Knowing women the way I do, this fits. Tride meaning: (obsolete, of a horse) strong and swift.\nWith a woman, you'll be true, and she'll test you, (you'll be tried), but the tables always turn. Ray? You'll be left with just a ray?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
