[\u00e2\u0080\u00a6] I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still very, very single. I think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m even more single than I was when I released In the Lonely Hour, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m insanely single. [\u00e2\u0080\u00a6] People are going to see, this one as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said is about me and something that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone through.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nWhen I heard this song it was as if he had been following me through my life with this one woman who I have been knowing over 15 years. Whenever we have problems she dump me and years later she wants to rekindle what we had, which we do and the cycle repeats itself. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting good at saying goodbye.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nTotally can relate to you...
