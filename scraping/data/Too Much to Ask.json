{"comment_0": "\nI think this song is about someone who's recently or not too long ago broken up with their partner. As shown by lyrics in the song such as, \"now I'm waiting on someone,\" and, \"my shadow's dancing, without you for the first time\" the individual singing the song has already started to move on but still shows remorse for things ending, and isn't over their ex, which is shown by Niall singing, \"cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet\". The singer also shows a desire to reconnect with their ex and see them again shown by the part where they say, \"my heart is hoping, you'll walk right in tonight,\" and hopes that they feel the same way.\n\nThis song really hits close to home because, I got my ex this CD for Christmas when our relationship hit rock bottom and a few months later we broke up, however I remember her playing it during car rides and this was the one song that stuck with me during the entire holiday season and some of the new year. After breaking up and listening to this song this really feels relatable as I find myself moving and feel regret over how things ended, I'd still like to reconnect and be friends but can't.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
