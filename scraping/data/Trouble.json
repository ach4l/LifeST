{"comment_0": "\nIn the first 5 lines she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questioning how loyal he really is. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s asking if he would get hurt for her, show affection, and do whatever she wants.\n\nIn the next 4 lines she's talking about this person taking pleasure out of her pain. And, I think, is sadistic in the way that he mistakes this brutality as love; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bet you kiss your knuckles/right before they touch my cheek\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd for the chorus she is singing about finally taking control of this sadistic/abusive relationship and deciding to leave finally; \"but I've got my mind made up this time\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\ndefinitely about an abusive/toxic relationship. \n\nthere's a lot of questioning going on, as that's what happens in these type of relationships....you start to wonder whether or not this person is worth all your time, love & energy. it's rough.\n\npart of her still loves him ; \"set a fire in my head tonight\" and \"i wouldn't leave you if you let me\" that's where the abuse part comes in. \n\nat the same time though, she knows it's toxic and unhealthy. \"i've got my mind made up this time\" and \"i bet you kiss your knuckles right before they touch my cheek\"\n\nshe also questions whether or not this person loves her as well. \"would you bleed for me\" & \"would you beg or would you crawl, stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me\"\n\nsuch lines make you think that this person is only there for a sexual/sadistic reason...they aren't looking for love at all.\n\ni adore this song, it's very sad and beautiful. ash almost sounds like she's gonna cry while singing it. raw emotions at their best.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
