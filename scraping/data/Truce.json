No matter what happened today, there is always a brighter tomorrow. And WE. OMG. You are not alone. So soothing.\n\nThe night is used as a symbol for depression or simply bad thoughts. \"I will fear the night again.\" It's not clear whether if he fears because he worries about the depressed people or he is depressed himself too. I think the latter. In friend please he says \"till we both see the light\". There is an understanding, his familiarity with this concept takes the song to another level.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nthis song to me is definitely about depression/suicide/etc. it talks about how you are going to die in the end, so spend this time taking pride in what you're doing and be happy.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_5": "\nI find it very interesting that (depending on how you interpret them) the songs of the album Vessel are a struggle with himself and God, whereas Blurryface is a struggle with self.

The whole album seems to be about Tyler's inner darkness and how it consumes him, kind of like blurryface. Being that this song is the final song, I think it's about Tyler's ending of this darkness for a time. His light and dark are making a truce.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\n\"Stay alive, stay alive for me\r\nYou will die, but now your life is free\r\nTake pride in what is sure to die\"\n\r\nThe chorus is basically telling the listener that your life is precious and even though you may be suicidal, there is still so much out there so while you are alive, you should take pride in what you have because one day you wont have it anymore.\n\r\nas for the first line, \"Now the night is coming to an end,\" I believe just ties into the entire story of the album Vessel. Ode To Sleep, for me, takes place just as Tyler is about to go to bed but he stays up all night because \"the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.\" So the entire album to me feels like it takes place all through out the night and Truce is kind of his way of finally giving into his sleep and going to bed but signing off with the very important message of \"stay alive.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_9": "\nHe's talking about us. That is a common theme in their songs. He rallies people together, and somehow makes \"We're broken people\" sound less like a sad cry for help, and more like a rallying battle cry to uplift and inspire us. He is well aware that the majority of their fanbase is mentally ill teenagers and young people.\n\n\"Now the night is coming to an end\" a lot of suicides take place at night. It is when people are alone with their dark thoughts in dark places. But you made it through another night. \n\"The sun will rise and we will try again\" 'we' is everyone. All the people in the world, all those that barely made it to morning, will do their best to make it through another day.\n\n\"Stay alive, stay alive, for me.\" This is Tyler pleading to us to stay alive, for him. In Guns For Hands, when he says \"I'm trying to sleep but I can't when you all have guns for hands\" is him worrying about us. Afraid for us. He cares about us. He stays up late worried about it. When he says this lyric, especially the second time, he sounds so emotional, so vulnerable, so desperate.\n\n\"You will die, but now your life is free\" so he talks about being free a lot, and to me, he means being free from yourself, being free from your mind, and all your problems. But I don't think that's what he means here. This is different, and is saying that you are already free. That your life is free. And the thing is, your life IS free. You can do whatever you want, whenever you want. I am not saying without consequences, but you can still do all these things. You can turn your life around, you can get better, you can do whatever you want. So, out of all the things you can do, don't choose to kill yourself. You WILL die someday, but not now. Death is guaranteed, so don't force it. Avoid it all you can. Because once you're dead, that's it. That's the end of the roller coaster. No. Live life all you can.\n\n\"Take pride in what is sure to die.\" You're sure to die, not now, but someday. Take pride in yourself. You've done so much in your life, even the little things are something to be proud of. Take pride in yourself.\n\n\"I will fear the night again\" He's knows it, he's accepted that his depression is a part of his life, and that it affects him at night. He doesn't let it control him, though. He's still hopeful. And if he'd killed himself when he was a teenager, look at what would be different today? Some of us wouldn't even be here. My point is, take a lesson from that. Your life is going to be amazing, but you have to be here to live it, and other people could even benefit from it.\n\n\"I hope I'm not my only friend\" He's feeling insecure, like we all do sometimes. I hope I'm not my only friend. I hope other people care about me as much as I care about them. I hope they don't just fade out of my life and leave me all alone. I hope I'm not really just annoying and all my 'friends' aren't just too nice to tell me I'm not theirs. I hope someone else will someday understand me, and that I'm not my only friend.\n\nThis is a genius song, and even though it's so simple, it's important, and I love it so much. \n\nIf you are reading this, stay alive.

I think that is my absolute favorite quote ever, or one of them at least. I'm atheist. But i know both tyler & josh are religious. And i think thats great! But me personally, i feel like they make their music for others to interpret in their own way. So, the way i see it is, he's talking about depression. He's saying that tomorrow is a new day. Tomorrow you can start over and try to be better than you were the day before. I've been dealing with depression for about 5 years now, and i got that lyric tattooed on my forearm. Twenty one pilots gave me a purpose. & i know this sight is for explaining lyrics, but i feel like this quote is something everyone can relate to. We've all done something we weren't proud of whether it be while depressed or just in general. This quote is saying that you can walk up tomorrow and wash all of that guilt  and depression off of you as the morning sun rises. Hes saying its a bad day, not a bad life. So, forget what you did the day before & try your best to move on and have a good day\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\nI don't have much to say because I agree with most of your thoughts, but if you know tyler you know that in his lyrics he tries to make a \"picture\" that other people can understand, with this I mean that he wants to make songs that we (FPE) can get related to.\nSo I think that when he says \"I hope I'm not my only friend\" I think that he not only means that he is scared of being alone but that there are more people like him and that feel the same, so he is not alone in this feelings.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nI agree with a lot of these interpretations but I think we should also take into consideration where Truce falls in Vessel. Tyler starts off Vessel with Ode to Sleep which is about his demons that come at night and him trying to fight them. Truce is the last song on the album and I think Tyler definitely had a purpose in putting it there. I see Vessel as being a fight with his inner demons and the lines \"Now the night is coming to an end. The sun will rise and we will try again\" is saying that neither Tyler or the demons won the battle but the battle isn't over yet. All he can do for now is call for a truce.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nThis is similar to the other comments, but a little different.
