{"comment_0": "\nThis is my favortie Daddy Yankee song as well as my favorite Zion Y Lennox Song. It is a guy tellin how he is crazy for a girl but he is afraid to tell her. The beat by Luny Tunes is one of their best. This song got very good airplay in Latin America and is a huge Reggaeton hit,but no video was made. For anyone who has had that crush or maybe more than a crush,but hasnt gotten the courage to say anything,this is your song,Tu Principe or Your Prince.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nthis song is really beautiful..i love the chorus.. aaawww to me is a sweet song i love it\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nChakamanaka mothasoca ya naw me juli feeli so so goodie wouldi shaka mi taca ya knaw!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nmemories...&& i didnt know :[ connection to my life. i luv this song. and its a guy try to express how he feels about a girl. but he's probably too shy to tell her.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
