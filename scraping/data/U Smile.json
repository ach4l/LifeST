{"comment_0": "\nI think this is the greatest song JBieber has ever sung. I'm not a fan though, I think his other songs are shallow and vain and make no sense. I love that in this song, he's surrendering his love to a girl (or guy, we're not sure). Here are the lines I absolutely adore:\n\n\r\n\"I wait on you forever any day, hand and foot, your world is my world.\" - he's willing to wait for her until the day he'll let him love her\n\r\n\"Baby you won't ever work for nothing\" - because she's only his everything\n\r\n\"You are my ins and my means now\" - she's his only way\n\r\n\"With you there's no inbetween. I'm all in.\" - he's not unsure, he has made up his mind\n\r\n\"'Cause my cards are on the table\" - there, he has surrendered his love on the table\n\r\n\"And I'm willing and I'm able\" - he will and he can be in love with her\n\r\n\"But I fold to your wish cause it's my command\" - but if she's not ready to fall in love, she does not want to yet, he will wait for her\n\n\r\nwell, that's how I see it (or hear it, whatever works)\n\r\nXD\n\n\n", "comment_1": "\nooooooh isn't Justin cool using text language in his song titles. \r\nBy now you may have realised i am speaking ironically and think he is a homosexual pimp stick \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nJB's best song. it's just so sweet and straightforward. reminds me of young middle school love <3\n\n\n"}
