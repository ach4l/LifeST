For me this is one of the most powerful songs ever written, not just by Metallica, but anyone, obviously James Hetfield has drawn on personal anguishes but kept the source of the pain hidden making it easy for each and every one of us to relate it to the lowest point of our lives. \r\nWhen I first heard the lyrics I was amazed at how it explained exactly the pain I was currently feeling as if he'd got inside my head and put into words the absolute agony I was suffering, esp 'Hold me until it sleeps' suggesting that I'd get through but never exorcise the underlying causes. I hope i've made sense!!

He tries to kill the bad inside him, to \"wash off the dirt\" and as a result he ends up fighting, but he doesn't know where to put it,so he takes it out on people close to him, this is probably why jason left, his mom died, and he had no control because there were no doctors, so he tried to control him to protect him,\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_93": "\nI love this track, we all have something nasty we know is bad for us but have to have it at any cost to our health or liberty, from the person that cannot stop eating junk food to the vile abuser who cannot stop themselves hurting others.
