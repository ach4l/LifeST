{"comment_0": "\nMaynard is a man who know much about psychology, and I totally agree with him on this one. The civilized mankind today is overprotected. Yet we feel unsafe, and most of all bored. To keep our mind of things we watch television and read the paper to hear the news from this world. \r\nWhat Maynard wants to say is that: WHY IS THE MOST INTERESTING STORIES IN THE NEWS THE SAD AND HORRIBLE ONES? People feel safe when they hear about other peoples deaths. And thet need to hear it. It is something satisfying about it in a non-maschistic way. Don't get me wrong here... we aren't vicous killers. \r\nThis world is filled with violence. We hate it, but we love to hate it. \n\r\nThink about it... When you see a newspaper with a big fat title \"Stabbed by husband.\" you don't go like \"hm... who cares.\" You grab it, buy it, read it, and go \"I'm glad that wasen't me.\" og \"pfft! what are the odds of that happening to me?\" Then you go on with your life with one less worry. \n\r\nViolence is like pornograhpy for your mind. \n\r\nI hope you understand.\r\nand please don't get for a murderer, or a suicidel dumbnut ;)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nBrainNevelle, if you just want to hear Maynard sing without the other 3 members then you aren't a Tool fan. Tool is one of if not the best band out there because of all it's members. Danny Carey may be the best drummer ever, and without his complex and powerful polyrythms Tool and Maynard would have no backbone to their songs. Same goes for the gripping and thundering guitar riffs and baselines by Adam Jones and  Justin Chancellor. You have no right to call anyone a fake fan.. if people are true fans, they listen to the whole band. Not just Maynard, don't get me wrong, I still think he is a god, but you have to get the whole picture. If Maynard wanted himself to be more prominent he would have done so. You probably have no appreciation for songs like Reflection on Lateralus.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nRegarding what BrainNeville has pointed out, I also agree that vocals in the song are on the background. But this is not something new for Tool at all. There are many examples where Maynard used his voice like an \"instrument with words\". My examples would be Reflection, You Lied, No Quarter and parts of other songs to. \n\r\nInterviews have also shown that Tool has aimed to use Maynard's voice like an instrument via effects and tricks. My counter argument is that we have to stop idealizing Maynard which makes us unable to concentrate on the music that these 4 talents make. \n\r\nThis is teamwork and why do we always have to see an idol, a frontman. Maynard is no Kurt Cobain. It's his style. Every single individual in Tool sees that all the other guys have suplendid talents and they like to present the whole picture. I appreciate and agree that Maynard has a extraordinarily divine voice and love listening to him like I'm hearing messeages from above. \n\r\nHowever, due to the reason that Maynard is not a frontman in Tool, and should not be, Maynard's voice should not override those of others. And still, I believe there are adequate (although when it comes to Maynard I never get enough) songs to hear him. \n\r\nI hope this new album will be another chance to hear Maynard's voice both infront of all others and as an instrument by himself. I take it either way.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis is more down to earth than usual from Maynard. It hits hard because it is not about hidden meanings. At first, the lack of mystery is almost disappointing for a die-hard. But the song itself is devastating and true tool. The meaning, as I see it: we consume information about the world's tragedies like vultures because, in part, it satisfies a need of ours. Why can't we just admit it? Because this vicariousness is horribly shameful. So we (la, la, la) lie about it. Maynard tells us to accept the truth, though, he really doesn't need or want to 'say it all again'.\r\nThis is a song about a human need that Maynard thinks is timeless ('so it is, so it's always been'): living vicariously off other people's tragedy. He does not hope for change, he demands recognition of this ailment. Because maybe we really should be ashamed.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nI think that this song is about the hypocrisies of today's society.

The problem is that in today's 24 hour media society we've become obsessed with the miniutae of watching others suffer but we can do it \"from a safe distance\" and no one needs to know how much we enjoy it.TV, newspapers, websites, it's all there, all the gory, nasty detail we could ever want to revel in and with no strings attached! You ask anyone if they enjoyed it and they will all say, \"Oooh no! It's disgusting and tragic. I can't understand why.\", just admit you enjoyed watching someone else suffer and be thankful it wasn't you!\n\nBrilliant track.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nWhen this album first came out I was listening to Vicarious while driving. I was stuck in traffic behind a taxi that had an advertisement on it for an exhibition called \"The Human Body\", where various aspects of the body are studied and put on display, like muscle/bone structures, skin fibres, vital organs etc etc. Funnily enough, the photo on the ad was very much like the cover of Lateralus, with the photo of a human being illustrating the layers beneath the skin.\r\nWhat really caught my attention were the words in bold italic underneath the image: \"REAL BODIES ON DISPLAY\"\n\r\nThis song really made sense to me after I saw that: I could picture people at the exhibition bypassing all the fake plastic skeletons, respiratory system drawings, etc etc, and heading straight for the \"real bodies\" where they would stand in droves and \"stare like zombies\" at this dead body on the table. \n\r\nI could also imagine that people \"wouldn't give pause\" to even consider going to the exhibition until they learn that real dead bodies are on display. And the fact that the advertisers found it necessary to even mention it on the ad as if that makes the whole experience more \"appealing\".\n\r\nBut the funny thing is: I am no different. I would have been there front row centre, looking at the dead body. Even though it's wrong, you can't help but look. \"Why can't we just admit it?\"\n\r\nWe are all \"Part vampire, Part warrior. Carnivore and voyeur.\" We are infatuated at the misfortune and suffering of others. \"Like blood to a vampire\"\n\r\nWhat genius. Thank you Tool.\n\r\nAnyway, I was late to work that day. But who cares!!!\n\r\nOne last parting thought: Think about all those times you watch TV, or watch a movie, or even watch a motor race and hope for a crash, a murder scene, etc. We are all monsters. We just need to admit it.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_7": "\nWoo, first comment.\n\r\nIncredible song, I'm pretty sure it's about how we all sit on the couch, hypnotized, watching TV and all the tragedies that are broadcasted that we take pleasure in viewing.

If you follow tool, you know that MJK gets a lot of his ideas from many of Jung's psycho/metaphysical theories.  Jung talks about a \"shadow self\"; that part of all of us that harkens back to a more primitive time when we were animals that killed to survive.  The shadow is that part of us that we connect with as we are walking through a woods say, and we come upon a baby bird on the ground (I got this from a brief overview of Jung I found on the internet - can't remember the reference), anyway we find this baby bird, a part of us naturally wants to rescue the chick and nurture it back to life. But there is that part of us that thinks just for a moment \"I could crush the life out of this thing\", and thrills at the prospect.  Jung said the more we deny our shadow, the more evident it encrouches onto our psyche.  So we deny we have this dark part of our souls, well then we start dreaming of marching through the woods stomping on baby birds.  So I think that is a lot of what the song is saying, that we can't deny our shadow self, we need to just admit we are dark souls in order to identify it and deal with it.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_11": "\nI think that in addition to this song being used to discuss the problem of the world living \"vicariously\" through their televisions, and not experiencing the world for what it really is, it also talks about how the media refuses to report on anything that isn't tragic.\r\nIn addition, I think it also talks about the hippocratical nature of humans, in that they view people who enjoy violence as \"monsters\", but then glue themselves to the television, hoping to hear of a bloody murder.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_12": "\nThis song is about the obvious need for tragedy and how humans are naturally more interested in horrible things than good things.

The answer may lie in the work of evolutionary psychologists and neuroscientists.  Humans seek out news of dramatic, negative events. These experts say that our brains evolved in a hunter-gatherer environment where anything novel or dramatic had to be attended to immediately for survival. So while we no longer defend ourselves against saber-toothed tigers, our brains have not caught up.\n\nMany studies have shown that we care more about the threat of bad things than we do about the prospect of good things. Our negative brain tripwires are far more sensitive than our positive triggers. We tend to get more fearful than happy. And each time we experience fear we turn on our stress hormones.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_15": "\nAt the 5 minute mark, the words in the background are the lyrics of Rosetta stoned\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_16": "\nI don't think this song is so much a view on society as it is an inward look at himself.  I think he's describing himself.\n\nThere's a sub-culture on the internet - and out in the real world for that matter - who watch videos and look for pictures of people being killed in homicides, accidents, war footage etc.  As many people know, there are websites dedicated to wholly to this kind of content.  I remember as a kid the old rotten.com webpage.  Think that but much, much worse.\n\nI believe Maynard is describing himself as one of these people.  A person that needs to watch gore, killing, maiming etc. under some kind of almost compulsion hence the lyric:\n\n\"I NEED to watch things die\"\nis used instead of\n\"I WANT to watch things die\".\nThere is a massive difference between 'need' and 'want' and I'm sure the use of 'need' is intentional.\n\nThe theory is also supported by the lyric that follows where he states he needs to watch things die \"from a good safe distance\" as although you are seeing intense images of destruction and death, it is still from the safety of your office or living room.\n\nPeople that view this content do not do so necessarily because they like death, or because they want the person in the video to die.  They do it because it's one of the most extreme things you can watch.  It's about violence getting one step more violent hence the lyric:\n\n\"That's my kind of story\nIt's no fun until someone dies\"\n\nI think that speaks to his need for the images he's seeing to go all the way, and show that last precipice of violence.  He needs to see that death, or it wasn't satisfying content.\n\nNOW, you might be thinking, what kind of sick person would watch that crap?  You'd have to be sick right?  Well, that's what Maynard is addressing in the second verse.  With the lyrics:\n\n\"Don't look at me like\nI am a monster\nFrown out your one face\nBut with the other\nStare like a junkie\nInto the TV\nStare like a zombie\nWhile the mother\nHolds her child\nWatches him die\nHands to the sky crying\n\"Why, oh why?\"\"\n\nMaynard is explaining, quite obviously, don't look at me like I'm some kind of sicko for watching this.  You will sit there and judge me, yet you watch NBC or Fox News every night and watch the same thing.  Death, killing, destruction.  Every night.  Hence the lyric:\n\nYou all need it too, don't lie\nWhy can't we just admit it?\nWhy can't we just admit it?\nWe won't give pause until the blood is flowing\n\nHe's saying why can't we all just admit, all we really want to see is violence.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_17": "\nspot on rather_dirty_nation  Vicarious is about living life vicariously through your television.

On Aenema, I thought the most intense was Third Eye, on Lateralus, my favorite song is the title track, plus some of the slower, more eerie songs (Reflection, Disposition). This is probably why the band has such a huge fan base, and ended up topping the chart.  Fans know the best stuff may never hit MTV...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_177": "\nDoes anyone notice how this sounds rather similar to Dream Theater's \"New Millenium\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_178": "\nDoes anyone know what he's whispering at the 5:00 mark?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_179": "\nholy shit Bearcules, thats really rough longing for that stupid fuck trexor, i do agree with you and everything but trexor (ouch)....and getting back to the song, bloody sunday has it about right\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_180": "\nand yes, if anything the rest of the album is just as good/even better than vicarious...and holmes i see where youre coming from with the new millenium thing, i think it COULD be compared but maynard is just too different a singer to Labrie, instrumentally, i can see the comparison just not vocally\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_181": "\nBearcules, you are the biggest douchebag on this site.  seconded closely by dustpan...  just because.

I think it can go on another level. Let me explain.\n\r\nEvery Tool CD has some underlying theme or tribute that people are forgetting to mention. Each theme on each album is expressed with an Intro, body, and a conclusion. For example: Anema - Intro: Stinkfist talks about how people should start opening their minds to new things. The body is Songs like Hooker with a Penis and Die Eier Von Satan that forces people to think for themselves to understand the situation. The conclusion is Third Eye where Tool finally says, \"See, now take this new way of thinking and apply it to your life.\"\n\r\nIn Lateralus, the theme is to be grateful that you are alive. The intro is The Grudge, saying that it is a waste of time to hold grudges with other people and it will only drain you of your life if you hold one. The body is mainly reflected in Parabol where the hole theme is to be gratefull you are alive, followed by the conclusion that is Disoposition and Reflection that is music that should make a person feel good and alive. Realizing that you should be happy you can smell the flowers; so to speak.\n\r\nIn 10,000 days, the entire theme of the album is Maynard's Mother. Every single song on the album can be a reflection to his Mother. Vicarious, for example, can be interpreted as how Maynard was forced to watch his Mother die slowly. Saying that watching death on the TV is A LOT different than seeing it happen in real life. Also that we shouldn't consider ourself experienced with death if we see it on the idiot-box. Obviously the body of the album is centered on Wings for Marie and 10,000 days. Saying that she should get a free pass into heaven because of the hell she had to endure on earth all while still staying faithful to the almighty. It ends with Right in Two and Viginti Tres. Very solid conclusions to the album. Reflecting that death is never a good thing, no matter what. Viginti Tres is just Maynards way of saying, \"Mom, you're home.\" \n\r\nNow to say that this album is inferior to the previous albums of Tool, I believe, is grossly wrong. In fact, I think it is the most personal album Tool has ever made. To express feeling in lyrics, and music so perfectly to reflect a memory of a loved one as they did in this album is a giant feat. The entire album is, in one word, beautiful. I could understand why they took 5 years to create it. It shows how Tool's music has matured through the years. I strongly believe this is one of the highest points in their carrier.\n\r\nOverall, I think this album has lived up to my eyes. To treat it as, \"utter crap\" is just a very synical view that unfortuantly many people take up. Tool has progessed further than that to keep the, \"world is crap, all I'm going to do is complain about it, \" attitude. It was started in Lateralus, it is now evolving into what is 10,000 days.\n\r\nDany Carey is the best!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_269": "\nsure.  dont thrive on halo.  thrive on musical hatred towards religion\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_270": "\nWow, thoughtful synopsis Offatwork.   I agree with your assessment.  I would add one thing though -- Tool's albums tend to have multiple themes.  In addition to being focused on Maynard's mother, I think another important theme covered is how humanity is destroying the earth as we speak.   Vicarious states \"the universe is hostile, so impersonal, devour to survive...\" how all creatures - including humans - kill each other as part of the circle of life.  Unfortunately with human population and consumption out of control (and free market economics ignoring environmental costs) humans are destroying ecosystems, and because we go buy our stuff from a clean aisle at walmart we don't realize the impacts we are having....\"Vicariously we live as the whole world dies\".   Similarly, \"Right in Two\" speaks to the tendency of mankind to be violent and self-destructive even though we have the intelligence to see the big picture and think outside ourselves:  \"repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability to lift an eye to heaven conscious of his fleeting time here.\" \n\r\nAs far as your album review, I completely agree.

Art is meant to inspire creativity, it is the tidal wave of energy that is meant to paint our worlds around us, coloring everything so brightly.\n\r\nUnfortunately, art today is used to stymie that.  We as creative thinkers are all letting the TV screen tell us what to do.  We let the movies take us away from our creativity.  It is creativity explained.  \n\r\nBut its not art's fault.  It is our own in the state of this world.  We are not quite monsters but so many of us are starved.  We are starved for love, feeling, success, and quality of life.  So many of us are alone, and with the internet, there's one more excuse not to be courageous and connect with each other.\n\r\nWe are letting the mediums control us, and we remain starved.  You are not a vampire by choice, but by survival.  When we lose ourselves we become desperate for the energies we don't receive.  We are acting and devouring out of survival, and unfortunately the world, government, and business have mandated this and incorporated it into technology.\n\r\nIt happened as soon as art was contained and transmuted into making a fast buck.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_274": "\ntits\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_275": "\nand ass\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_276": "\nequals good night\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_277": "\ngood fight, good night\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_278": "\njust a note... the \"Carnivore and voyeur\" line might be reffering to the FBI 'Carnivore' program in which private civilian emails and electronic communications are intercepted and viewed by the goverment.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_279": "\ncool do u watch porn in ur skidmarked undies\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_280": "\nhas anyone else noticed a possible production error at the begginning before the first second has elapsed?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_281": "\nActually, has anybody even imagined that maybe we've all been tricked. I know that questioning religion these days is just asking to be burned at the stake, but it's worth it. The entire 10,000 days album is about Maynard's mother(just as Offatwork said) and there are also very strong religious overtones and undertones, i.e. \"Right in Two,\" \"Wings for Marie PT 2,\" etcetera. If you apply such facts to Vicarious, what do you get? Well, \"That's my kind of story,\" \"While the mother holds her child, watches him die, pleads to the sky crying: 'Why, oh why?' Because I need to watch things die,\" \"FROM A DISTANCE,\" \"Vicariously, I live, while the whole world dies, you all need it too, don't lie\" These quotes and pretty much all the other lyrics in this song sound like a First-Person perspective of GOD. This could be because of Maynard's anger/hurt toward God for his mother's problems, and he is again saying that you can devote your life to being religious and following all the requirements of such, and still get screwed(Remember APC's Judith). It is actually almost a sequel to Judith. Also, for anyone that has been following Tool, you will realize that Tool has many songs that Maynard doesn't mind writing a few lyrics against/about religion(christianity in particular). This makes perfect since if you are aware of his family's position on such things, and the effects this had on his upbringing. 10,000 days is amazing. LA TE RA LUS is amazing. AENIMA is amazing.

Result: sounds faster, harder and more spectacular. Some will see it as a rape, especially because MJK's voice sounds different and I mess with the song digitally. I thought it was pretty cool.

Since their goal is making money, they need to sell their stories to the public. And the public wont watch them unless they are entertaining. and what entertains people? according to maynard it's watching ppl die. ok so bush starts this war in iraq, which every tv station in the US provides coverage of, im sure most americans watched the war on tv. think about the huge amounts of money the media made from the so called \"war on terror\". Bush paints himself out to be  the good guy- you know- and iraq is evil etc. its like watching an action movie where america is the hero. sensationalism. and thats what this song is about. Large media corporations profiting from the masses watching bush's war on terror. the whole bush administration is completely controlled by corporations seeking to make a profit. And the media is the most powerful of these. Bush is a puppet for the media, and is working with the media to brainwash the american people into believing that he is waging a war on terror.. the real terrorists are the media moguls(rupert murdoch etc) who were profiting from coverage of the war. so all you get to watch are stories that are designed for one purpose- entertainment to the consumer. so you watch more and more and more. i admit to finding the iraq war quite entertaining, but it was just the way the media portrayed it. i think this song is an attack on sensationalism in the media. not people having some sort of built-in desire to watch others die. Im sure if half of americas population saw what is really happening in iraq they would be disgusted. its just the media portraying in a sensational way, attaching a story involving heroes and villains, that makes it entertaining to watch.to quote salival \"think for yourself, question authority\"-ie dont believe everything you see on the news.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_313": "\nThe Neo-conservative manifesto explains alot of what the American media, mainly Fox News portrays.

It almost begs you to admit how you are vicarious, and how you can not survive happily until your mind has fed off the sustenance of others' suffering. But then, when you do, you feel no better; there is no peaceful resolve. You realize your own sickness, which you (humanity as a whole) have been trying to deny with all your existence. All that work and effort thrown away, because now you have been tricked into seeing this truth about yourself.\n\r\nBut, this basically goes in flow with The Pot. It gets the point across that you are not much different than the author, and then The Pot rolls along a few songs later and asks, \"so why the hell are you waving your finger at me? Ganja, please!\" \n\r\nOf course, the songs between these two help build a certain guilt that may be present within the listener. We go from a depiction of indulgent, almost sickening, humanity to a person who was so tremendously holy. The comparison makes the listener go from \"admit you're fucked up\" to \"look at this amazing person who no one can ever be\" and then rolls into The Pot, basically say \"So why the hell do you think you're better than me?\"\n\r\nSounds reminiscent of certain Christian converting tactics.

Personally, i like them both.  But i think that the other three memebers of tool don't receive nearly enough recognition.\n\r\nThis song to me is about how it is human nature to feed off the tragedy of others.

Hence the \"hippy haze\".  But what tool is saying here is that we can't move above it, because it is just survival.  If we move above it then we cease to survive.

The answer may lie in the work of evolutionary psychologists and neuroscientists.  Humans seek out news of dramatic, negative events. These experts say that our brains evolved in a hunter-gatherer environment where anything novel or dramatic had to be attended to immediately for survival. So while we no longer defend ourselves against saber-toothed tigers, our brains have not caught up.\n\nMany studies have shown that we care more about the threat of bad things than we do about the prospect of good things. Our negative brain tripwires are far more sensitive than our positive triggers. We tend to get more fearful than happy. And each time we experience fear we turn on our stress hormones.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_429": "\npsychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201012/\u2026    explains why VICARIOUS is an accurate observation regarding upright apes walking around killing each other  while the congragation of apes watch in disgusted delight....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_430": "\nI think this ones about how there life is no longer sacred, and how we all get a thrill from watching people kill or be killed... \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_431": "\nPretty sure it's another one criticizing the media for feeding on sensationalism and turning us into unempathetic monsters.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_432": "\nThis song goes well with manga \"Gantz\"...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_433": "\nI believe in \"angels in the hearts of men.\" Human's are not all evil.

Tool's lyrics are some of the most brilliant I've ever heard. I can't say that I pretend to know as much as some of the other comments but after some deep study into the ones I've really listened to, that is what I take from them. The band's musicians are great and play an excellent part into drawing you into the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_436": "\nI personally believe this song has a double meaning, like what the previous comments say about the decline of modern society, but also it's a song about how god who physically doesn't exist per se, lives Vicariously through the belief of the very people who live and die on earth.\n\r\n\"Hands to the sky crying \"why oh why?\" \n\r\n\"Cause I need to watch things die from a distance\"\n\r\nA few other hints like the angels in the hearts of men line, or the universe is hostile; it's a common belief that the universe itself is god.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_437": "\nAnd so this song is about the bullshit laws created by man and not god to keep our natures in check? \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_438": "\nI LUV THIS SONG LOLZ.\r\nIt's a good song.\n\r\nNo srsly.

Makes more sense considering the line after it, too.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_440": "\nThey are talking about today's world, with TV. But when I listen to this song I always consider that this is not new behavior for humans. Death has always been entertainment, as long as it happens to someone else. Lynchings were a popular attraction throughout Europe and America until 100 years ago. The Romans pitted slaves against each other in fights to the death. It's a big morbid circus. Modern media just gives us easy access.\n\r\nMaybe it all goes back to the Jungian shadow stuff that og_tool has enlightened us with. That was an awesome comment.\n\r\nAnother interpretation of my own, which is not supported much by the lyrics I admit, is that God is the one vicariously experiencing death through our mortality. God can't die, so he made life that way. It is cruel. We are made in God's image, sharing his nature while being human, so we are cruel. But, I don't know if this song is actually saying anything about God.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_441": "\nits not just that it amuses us or we like violence and death and destruction. Its that it is necessary. \"devour to survive so it is, so its always been\" basically he is saying embrace it. pull your head out your hippie ass. if you want peace prepare for war type of thing. and stop acting appalled at it when its inside you too. Sigmund Freud came to the conclusion after studying the events of world war 1 that the desire to cause destruction is the single greatest motivating factor in human beings. It is more powerful than sexual desire. thats deep right?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_442": "\nIts very fucking simple, you dumb-ass hogs.  Quit trying to over-complicate it.  He's talking not only about human perception, but God's as well. We are created in his image (or so the Holey Bible {no, I did not mispell that} tells us)...  It's as plain and clear as the sunrise in our everyday lives: we crave death and destruction... because he does and he made us that way because its fun to watch us slaughter each other.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_443": "\nI am a huge Maynard fan ... He is proabably the most true artist of my generation.  I have one question though??? Does this song sound like crap to anyone else but me?  I'm not talking about the lyrics but the music is too loud and over powering over Maynard's lyrics which are the true genius.  Don't get me wrong I love good guitar riffs and and drum beats ... but this song makes me wish I could hear Maynard sing it  acapella.  The beats sound old and redone ... and all I want to hear is Maynard's words ... Talk crap on this post ... I say your not a true Maynard fan... F@#k tool ... F@#k APC ... Maynard is what we true fans want to hear ...  I find it funny how people today are debating lyrics when it is nearly impossible to hear Maynard's voice over the music...  I really hope on May 2, Maynard realizes this song sounds like crap... and holds it another two weeks so I can hear his lyrics (tell me I'm not right) I own every cd with maynard on it and everything else I can only get off the net... I'm a fan of the man ... his bands are secondary...  Seriously ... i want to hear a good arguement about what I've said...Or even more that i'm exactly right... I'll stop ranting here but expect some later with bullshit fake fan coments....\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_444": "\nThis song means to me that I need to change my underwear cause I just soiled them\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
