{"comment_0": "\nCan't believe there are no comments for this! Oh well, I'll be the first. Virginia Bluebell is a song that I believe no-one can listen to without being touched and inspired. She is trying to tell her friend, who has been hurt/torn apart/lost/afraid/depressed/and has suffered from a lack of belief in herself, \"to look up and let the world see all the beauty that you're made of.\" It's a sad song, but also an uplifting one. She is trying to show that no matter what has happened, is happening or will happen, she will always be there and the person she's singing to will always be her Virginia Bluebell. Her vocals are absolutely stunning and the first time I heard it I had tears in my eyes. The lines, \"Put a little light in the darkest places. Put a little smile on the saddest faces\" Show that this girl/woman clearly has a beautiful personality and presence and that she just has to find the strength to show it again.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
