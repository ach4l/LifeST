{"comment_0": "\nI think this song is about being in denial about loving someone.\n\nAll the things he says like: \"I can feel you watching even when you're nowhere to be seen\nI can feel you touching even when you're far away from me\nEvery time I see you, I don't know why my heart begins to race\nEvery time I leave, I don't know why my heart begins to break\" those are all symptoms of being in love.\n\nAnd this is so new to the person, that they think it some sort of spell because it is such a strong feeling.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI agree with crysticreme. The line \"I'm saying things I never say\" enforces that too. \nIt's like they're never the type to become seriously into someone else, so they just don't understand why they're doing things they've never desired to do before. Love the idea of the song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
