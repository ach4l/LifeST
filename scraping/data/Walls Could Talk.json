{"comment_0": "\nTwo youths whose shared past (and their endless stories AKA \"Walls Could Talk\") as Lovers, Passionate Opinionated, Driven Individuals (imagine a Hurricane {another Halsey Song} meeting a Tornado)... was off-the-hook including physical violence.\n\nYears pass and they encounter each other again... thinking it could be different this time... IT WON'T.\n\nNow they simply put on false faces as though nothing happened... BUT IT SURELY DID....\n\n\n\n\nI feel the pain of Halsey if all her songs are about herself\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
