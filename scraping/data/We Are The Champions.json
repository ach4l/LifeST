This became especially apparent while working through a somewhat deep depression a while back.  Before, especially as a kid, all I ever saw it as was a victory song to be played after a sporting event or something of that sort.  It had no meaning to me beyond that.  Because of that, I always kind of overlooked it because of how overplayed it seemed to be.  In the thick of it, while I was on the verge of tears, it came on the radio and I actually started really LISTENING to the lyrics.\n\r\nThat's when the overcoming theme hit me.  Maybe it's kind of obvious to a lot of you, but for me it took a while.  Now, when I hear him say \"We are the champions,\" I'm not envisioning a guy scoring a last minute goal.  The \"we\" Freddy Mercury is singing about is actually you and me.  If you've ever had a time where you felt like laying down, giving up, dying, but you're still here.  You're not giving up.  You're going to stick through to the end.  You're going to get right back up every time life throws you to the ground and keep fighting, no matter how big a challenge is standing before you.  No matter how hopeless your goal may seem.  That's how you're a true champion.\n\r\nThank you Freddy, for your encouraging words.  They've helped me through tough times more than you could know.  May you rest in peace.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nHeh...so many people complain about this being used as a sports anthem (including me) but Freddie actually wrote it as a sports anthem: \"...I was thinking about football when I wrote it. I wanted a participation song, something the fans could latch on to. It was aimed at the masses; I thought we'd see how they took it. It worked a treat. When we performed it at a private concert in London, the fans actually broke into a football chant between numbers. Of course, I've given it more theatrical subtlety than an ordinary football chant. You know me.\" Though he said he may also have been commenting on Queen's success: \"I suppose it could also be construed as my version of 'I Did It My Way.' We have made it, and it certainly wasn't easy. No bed of roses as the song says. And it's still not easy.\" (queen.musichall.cz/\u2026) Though all of the other meanings of the song could still apply, even if they weren't what Freddie originally intended.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nWhy does everyone assume every song Freddie's written is about being gay?!!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nAnyone here who claims this song is about homosexuality makes themselves look ignorant and small minded, not to mention probably prejudiced in some cases.

And considering Mercury was battling Aids (in private...for the most part) this song has more meaning...although the timing of its release was probably before his diagnosis). \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_77": "\nThis song is about freddie Mercury and his path to glory. \"I've done my sentence, but committed no crime\" Therefore, people judged him for his homosexuality, but he committed no crime. also, \"You've brought me fame and fortune And everything that goes with it I thank you all But it's been no bed of roses no pleasure cruise and I consider it a challenge before the whole human race And I'd never lose\" In other words, he thanks everybody for his fame and fortune. but it was not easy to get that far. And, he considers it a challenge to get all of humanity to accept people with homosexuality, and he will never lose the fight. Another thing, \" we'll keep on fighting till the end\" he will keep on fighting for his rights till he dies.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_78": "\nThis is a great song. It may have been made at the same time as We Will Rock You with a popularity to match, but its more like early progressive rock songs they did like Bohemian Rhapsody. The backup singing reminds me of Lion King.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_79": "\nWe are the champions\nWe are the champions\nNo time for losers\n'Cause we are the champions\n--------\n\nMy song. And Freddie Mercury is/was the best! Here's to an excellent musician.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_80": "\n\"And we mean to go on and on and on and on\"...my song. Freddie rules...even all these years later few have what he had (musically). RIP.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_81": "\nFreddie stated that this song was about football, but as everybody knows, Freddie would act very coy when asked to define his songs. I think you really have to look at what was going on in Queen history at the time to understand the scope of the song.   Basically, Queen were hated by critics and the music press.  Yet, they were selling out arenas around the world and were selling a massive amount of records.  I think this song was basically a braggadocios  \"fuck you\" to the music press.  It's a song about the perseverance and resiliency of the band.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_82": "\nI heard that this song is supporting gay ppl. Freddy Mercury is gay, and I guess he was saying, getting by wasn't easy.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_83": "\nquality tune.fucking quality\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_84": "\nthis is a wicked song but has anyone seen the freddie tribute where liza minelli absolutely slaughters this song?\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_85": "\nVery amazing song. Although Freddie was one ugly mother :|\r\nhehe\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_86": "\nTo AND512:\n\r\nEr - Freddie must have been amazingly prescient to have known in 1977 - when the song was recorded - that he would die in 1991 of a disease completely unknown at the time! \n\r\nApart from that, I can hear two melodic influences in the song - \"Send in the Clowns\" and the ancient playground taunt \"naa-naa na-NAA-naa!\" Doesn't mean it's a bad song, though, just not very original.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_87": "\nI think it's pretty obvious that this song is about breaking up and a girl that he loved.\n\r\nHe felt like he and his lover were the champions of the world cause she could suck a mean dick.  And I don't know about you, but after I blow my load down the back of a hot girls throat, I feel like a champ.\n\r\nAlso, the part where he thanks everyone, he is thanking the 70s era society for making it ok for girls to be sluts, which means he gets lots of cocksucking.\n\r\nAnd in the part where he says that it's no bed of roses, etc, I think he means that he was trying to get the same girl to do anal, but she wasn't very cooperative, so instead of coaxing or romanticizing her into it he just dropped some roofies into her drink and took her anal virginity.\n\r\nBut then his penis had poop on it and the race he talks about was a race to get the poop and blood from her anus off of his dick before she woke up.\n\r\nThen when he says he's committed no crime, he means that it's ok to do what he did if your girlfriend won't give up her chocolate starfish and that you should do just what she did.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
