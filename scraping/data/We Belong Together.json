I also wanted to add that this song is at the top of my list on her best. The meaning is obvious...it is about a man who she is no longer with but misses dearly.

And I do not think that these songs are bad, or that these people have poor singing talent, but I absolutely hate, with every fiber of my being the greed and money there is to be made through these artists, and the shallow people who buy these records and cannot seem to understand anything aside from their own feelings and buying something that sounds good, but in essence, has no meaning. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_55": "\ni luv da lyrics......f****n awesum!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_56": "\nom i lu tis song so totally remid me of me ex boyfriend and me longgggg story of  what happen \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_57": "\nthis mean how two ppl belong together but if you leave my side who would be there??\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_58": "\nthis song is well writen and it always reminds me that i have a special someone and that i should never let go of him because i will want him back and the pain i will have without him\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_59": "\nI get the feeling that this was written for Tommy.

She said that this was her favorite song on the album, and that it was written from a lot of memories. She even cries in the video. She also does live performances and really puts her feelings into the song. No other song I've seen her really get into it like this one. She looks like she is about to have a breakdown. There was a performance where she was ask about Tom, and immediately right after she performed this song. Not to mention that her wedding dress in the video looks a lot like the one she wore on her wedding day to Tommy. They said that they both were devastated when it ended. I feel she still loves him. I feel for her situation. Breaks my heart that she's trapped in this business, and can't be truly free. She clearly has a lot of pain.

This was her comeback album, and she was still recovering from Glitter and her emotional breakdown. And I know Virgin paid her like 130million to leave because of how terrible Glitter was. Sebsequetly she had to sign to a slightly less powerful label and spent a few years resting. She made 'Charmbracelet' during this time, her lowest selling studio album at that point. And didn't she put on her old wedding dress for the video? Who the hell puts on their old (divorced) wedding dress? Sounds like someone misses someone alright. And wants to go back. Its like the song was a \"take me back\" message and the industry answered.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
