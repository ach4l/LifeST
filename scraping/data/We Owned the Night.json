{"comment_0": "\ni believe its about having that one majical night when you meet that one person you spend the whole night with then never seeing or talking to them ever again... kinda like that one night stand that felt even better then being in love with someone ya no??!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nEven though this song is about a one night stand, it is so effing beautiful!! I agree with jami1andonly, maybe this person meant more than your thought, but you're satisfied that you got them that once. And you have that beautiful night to remember, when we owned the night. Sigh. Love.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nGreat song, although a little sad. It's about losing a dream (a relationship) due to being unable to voice ones feelings for another. When he was with her he felt he had it all (\"we owned the night\"). Whenever he looks upward to the sky he thinks of her and what he had (and lost). Apparently when he needed to act (to speak) the words escaped him...and she him. First listen to this band. I like 'em. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
