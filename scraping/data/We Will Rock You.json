Here is what the song really means......it a three different snapshots of one mans life....as a boy....a young man and an old man.....as a boy He is playing.....kicking his can all over the place...refers to a childrens game called kick the can....waving your banner all over the place and the blood on your face line refers to the fact that many young folk get involved in causes,factions and the like when they still are motivated by idealism and finally as an old man who has come full circle,back to his childhood.both the first verse and the last includes the line...mud on your face....as an old man he hasn't changed a thing hence he is a disgrace.....this has nothing to do with gay rights or any of that shit. I find it amusing that gays wrap themselves in the cloak of Queen music to espouse their lifestyle.I am no homophobe but I find it tedious that Gays wanna find some gay reference in almost every queen song.Get a fucking clue.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nHey, this is my first post here, I'm surprised to see that people seem to be confused about this song, for me the meaning is clear. Ok the way I always thought of this song is that it is about a Revolution.\n\r\nFreddy Mercury is the Voice of the Ruler (a King or Dictator or something) and he is speaking to a crowd of Protestors (Revolutionaries), He's trying to bring them down, saying things you're a \"big disgrace\". The People respond with just shouting \"We Will Rock You!\", meaning We Will Bring you down or We Will Overthrow you!\n\r\n\"Waving your banner all over the place\" Clearly the crowd is carrying Revolutionary banners.\n\r\n\"Buddy you're an old man poor man \r\nPleading with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day \r\nYou got mud on your face \r\nYou big disgrace \r\nSomebody better put you back into your place\"\n\r\nThis bit shows this clearly, the poor people are rising up and their ruler says get back into your place. i.e. I'm in charge you're just a lowly peasant.\n\r\nI assume that in the end the people storm the Ruler's palace and overthrow him.\r\nTo me this is defiantly an anti-authority song, I don't know if my interpretation is 100% correct but that's the way I've always imagined this song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI just recently saw my 1/2 brother, and he was an 70's child so I asked him what he thought the song meant.

Are those with mud on their faces, at different ages, different generations (in one time frame? or at different time frames, meaning the same boy, man and old man???), stomping, fighting our society? Or, is Queen telling us that \"they,\" the men represented in the lyrics, deserve to be stomped? If so, exactly WHY?  And why is this song followed by The Champions? Did Queen mean that those who thought that the boy, man, old man in We Will Stomp You, to be annhiliated, socially, then would be \"stomped\" out by the champions of the world?  Please enlighten me.

Yews, I said 1976. \n\r\nThis song was commissioned for the defunct NASL San Jose Earthquakes as a theme song for the struggling professional soccer team. In a short pre-game concert (I was there for the game, I had won tickets from my youth soccer league) Queen played the song. The Earthquakes owned the rights to the song for one year, after that Queen was free to present it to the world as their work. \n\r\nIt sounds like a sports song because it was specifically written to be a sports theme, such as the Chicago Bulls or LA Lakers theme songs.\n\r\nThe concert is far more memorable than the game, it was totally unannounced and unexpected until we took out seats and there was a stage on the field. Queen actually had to INSTRUCT us how to do the two stomp and a clap action by pantomiming the action on stage.\n\r\nWhen the song was released on 45rpg vinyl records, the song \"We Are the Champions\" was included on the flip side because it also had a sports theme.

I guess i was wrong, though, so here's my interpretation for each verse:\r\n1) The protagonist is a child and all about competition (playing Kick-the-Can or any other sport); his goal is to \"be a big man someday\", i.e. to prove how good he is, and he's singing for his team.\r\n2) Similarly, the protagonist has grown up to be a youthful idealist (probably a revolutionist, judging from the blood on his face), who wants to prove that his ideas are superior. Once again, he's singing on behalf of his team, or party, or regime.\r\n3) This is where things change. Now the protagonist is old and downtrodden the mud on his face is probably from living on the streets. He realises that the views he had in his youth were flawed, and he just wants to find a measure of peace. But now \"somebody\" (possibly another young man like he once was) is gonna put him back into his place and reassert the competition and one-side idealism that he now know are not the answer.

They created them because they always wrote songs from their own hearts and minds, just with the view of self-expression. But they heard alot of their fans singing along, and decided they would make we will rock you, and we are the champions so that fans had something they could take part in easily and that was memorable. (hence the clapping and stomping, and the rallying tones with repeated lines in both songs.) The 'we' in many verses and lines, and in both song titles also indicates this. In other words, it was made for the fans to enjoy themselves more, as a kind of thankyou, i suppose, which is nice :). \n\r\nBut as for underlying meaning, that is debatable.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_68": "\ndoesnt Queen Just Rock???\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_69": "\nI can agree with that HoE BuNnY\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_70": "\nqueen : best of all time\n\n\n\n", "comment_71": "\nnice song, its got a cool beat to it. nice to listen to when yuo're hyper \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_72": "\nit's one of  the best cheering songs ever,though is good for partys\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_73": "\nThis song reminds me of when i was a kid and in the school yard in brooklyn we used to sing this to kids when we thought we were all tough and crap :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_74": "\nthis, along with We are the Champions started out as gay anthems you know, but it was used so much by sports that it kinda changed what they ment.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_75": "\nThis song is a reference to KISS.\"You got mud on yo' face You big disgrace\" is a reference to KISS make up and Gene Simmons.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_76": "\nTime to completely ruin the alpha-male sentiment.\n\r\nA friend of mine made some points that I thought were really interesting with this song.
