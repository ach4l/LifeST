The word mental illness gives people a certain image that is just not fuckin'true.There are different degrees of everything.\r\nBeing \"Labeled mentally deranged\" but by who?\r\nI have read alot of these lyrics from day one and with the most recent St Anger song \"Unnamed Feeling\" get the impression that James might be BP also.It lad me to drug abuse to change my moods I didn't like and try and keep people away.\r\nOne problem with BPdisorder is that you \"cycle\" these feelings and moods can't be controlled.There is no cure.  \r\nSo i tcan seem that time stands still at times and no one leaves, it's always there.\r\nI know this isn't a very fuckin' metal explination but believe me I am VERY metal.This is just a song that gives a point of view from someone that has been called mentally ill and is being forced to see that his views on things are wrong.Finally the only way to feel like you can make a point is to kill the fucks that have been holding you down and telling you that you are getting better.\r\nTrust me this disease isn't fun and and the funny thing is the docs  tell me that this music is too negative. Like \"Fade To Black\".. I say bullshit. I feel good knowing that there is someone else that feels alot like I do and has the balls and talent to sing about it. Want more BP lyricss? Read \"Until It Sleeps\" and alot of others and as mentioned \"Unnamed Feeling\". Everyone feels like this jsut some of us have a harder time controling it.\n\r\nNow the funny side of this song is I used to listen to it on my way to work at the factory and it fuckin' fits perfectly there for me too!\r\nBy the way..\"Master Of Puppets\" is THE best thrash metal LP EVER. Bar none. From  \"Battery\" to the last kickyour ass tune \"Damage, Inc\" it just doesn't get ANY better!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nUh dude, what the hell are you talking about?

The thing about no locked doors or bared windows is interesting.  That probably means that it is like a sanitarium where they dont lock us in and we can leave, but ppl are too afraid that they will stand out and look stupid.

Good song though, i listen to a radio station in Indianapolis that has something called \"Mandatory Metallica\" where they play three songs by Metallica every night.

However i'd like to mention the possible connections to Stanley Kubricks A Clockwork Orange and Peter Weirs The Truman Show. Both this song and the films are about a protagonist whose mental illness is produced by the failure of the societies that imprison them, ultimately result the protagonists to defy their rules of their society through drastic measures such as murder,suicide or escape.\n\r\nAs with metallica63, this song struck a personal chord with me. As a young child, my parents became concerned about the slow pace of my development, in contrast to my siblings. The doctors, teachers, and occupational therapists they spoke to said that i was intellectually disabled, and advised that i be sent to\r\na school where i would be placed in a support class.Everyday my class followed a  routine that involved doing mainly kindergarten things  such as dancing to kids songs and watching preschooler shows. However it hit the fan about two years later in 1999, when i realized that the routine given to the whole class was not going to change and each year we would only be taught at kindergarten levels. Soon I realised my older brother,who was at a different school, was actually learning more advanced things .As the repetition of the aforementioned routines became more apparent i gradually changed from being a happy sociable person, to a frequently upset hypochondriac who would sometimes behave violently if things didn't go my way. Eventually it climaxed when my parents realized that the advice the sought out was incorrect and I was transferred to my brothers school, without an apology or an explanation from my folks and consequently I did not know this until many years later. \n\r\nWhen i did find out, it was in an especially painful period of my life where i was trying to cope with the fact that the relationship between me and one of my few and closest friends was broken. My friend said that the reasoning that i was overly obsessed with video games at the time. At this time, I pretty much had zero support and i did not say anything to my parents about what i was going through. During this period though, my parents at one point had to clean out their cupboards and i stumbled upon a folder containing my medical records which included several letters from the doctors who provided my diagnosis. These letters mentioned that i had displayed symptoms of autism such as obsessionality which i immediately linked to my alledged obsession with video games. The impact of these letters left me devestated. Within a handful of minutes I had been told the following things\n\r\na. Why i spent several years in a dreadful school environment\r\nb. That i was born with an intellectual disability that my parents never told me about.\n\r\nand due to a lack of understanding at the time, i had the impression that\r\nc. My friend had left me because an external factor was interfering with the functionality of my brain and was stopping me from being myself. \n\r\nPoint C was particularly important to me as i spent several years wishing i had known about the diagnosis earlier so my friend would understand my obsessionality. Consequently i lived in denial about my hobbies believing they were the result of the autism and not me being me. \n\r\nEventually in recent years, i began bringing up my past in several conversations to my parents who explained that the doctors had mis-diagnosed me as being intellectually disabled and are trying re-enforce the message that im doing well in school. I doubt that though as I'm now considering leaving school, because i wish to avoid a repeat of the emotional traumas I've experienced. My friend came back into contact with me and confessed that he was a jerk at the time. We're now best friends. \n\r\nIf any one of you have managed to read this far into my post, you're probably wondering what the point of it is. I'll say it now. The point I wish to make is that judging from my personal experiences, the song Welcome Home (Santarium) performed by James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Lars Ulrich and of course the late and sorely missed Cliff Burton, provides the warning that a mis-diagnosis and the related treatments can have a serious effect on the lives of patients especially in regards to their sense of self. The effects can be serious enough to nearly break ones sense of identity, causing their behavior to go hay wire, before they spend the rest of their lives dealing in its aftermath.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "comment_98": "\nI was in a mental hospital few months ago and this song keep playing in my head.

The rage of being told that their mentally deranged when they themselves dont feel different at all is stifling. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_102": "\nI've always thought this song to be about a person who is wrongly held in a mental asylum and tries to convince others that he's not mental, and trying to get away, but then he just seems more crazier to them... But I'm most likely wrong. Everyone has their own interpretation!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_103": "\nI believe this song is about a man with some sort of incurable illness who seeks help in a sanitarium. He was thrown out of society for acting in such a strange manner. In the beginning he enjoys his stay. He can do almost anything he wants there. The longer he stays at the place, the worse his illness gets. He wants to leave but he has become so unconsciously dependent on this place he doesn't. He later goes insane and thinks that the people there are mistreating him. He becomes so crazy he decides the only way to truly leave he must kill himself.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_104": "\nThe people that have unjustly targeted people as unforgiven and bully them making them believe they are mentally ill trying to submit them into suicide will never win cause you can't hold a good person down. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_105": "\nLove this song \u00e2\u009d\u00a4\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_106": "\nwell this song is basicaly the more badass, master of puppets version of ride the lightning.\nits very to the point.\nit is about a guy who is mentally ill and is put in a sanitarium. but he hates it there. he thinks its a prison with no bars.\n\"no locked doors no windows barred, no things to make my brain seem scarred\"\nhe is commenting on how its a wolf in sheeps clothing. it looks nice but it is just like prison.\nhe continues to say how he wants out.\n\"i dream my freedom every night\"\nbut his dream came true in the worst form possible. its the sanitarium he resides in.\nalso, the whole time he is talking to someone. hes telling this \"freind\" to just let it show him the horror of the sanitarium. so he tells him to leave him alone and get some sleep.\nhe comes back tomorrow and the man tells us more.\n\"build fear of whats out there, cannot breathe the open air.\"\nthis is about how the sanitarium treats the victims. it crushes their hopes with fear of the world and how it will be worse.\n\"whisper things into my brain, assuring me that im insane\"\nmore on how the sanitarium treats the victims\n\"They think our heads are in their hands but violent use brings violent plans\"\nthe man talks on how the torture and pain of the sanitarium fills him with plans of leaving and escaping.\n\" keep him tied it makes him well, hes getting better cant you tell?\"\nthis is a tidbit not from the man, but from the nurses.\nthis is how the nurses talk to one another about the paitents.( i will explain later)\n\"No more can they keep us in listen, damn it, we will win\"\nthis is the man on his plans of escape. and how he will bring others to safety. away from the sanitarium.\n\"they see right, they see well, they think it saves us from our hell\"\nmore on how oblivious the nurses are to the pain\n\"Fear of living on\nNatives getting restless now\nMutiny in the air\nGot some death to do\nMirror stares back hard\nKill, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s such a friendly word\nSeems the only way\nFor reaching out again\"\nand this is the saddest part. this section details his escape and how he out of fear murders someone.\nand thats what this song is about. how sanitariums dont ever help. they are worse than prison. they torture the victims and they rarely know better than to stop them because of their condition. and the sad part is this isnt really getting better.\nand im sure it wont for a while.\nplease avoid putting your loved ones in homes. they suck.\nmy mother is a licensed psychologist and she hates sanitariums and homes.\neverything from the nurses to the enviornment is absolute shit.\nand thats what this song\"s story is.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_107": "\nOk I am a big metallica fun and I came up with this little story based on the titles of metallica songs. the titles are in capital letters.\n\n\r\nI park my 2*4 and step out, home at last but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a FRANTC state thinking about my narrow ESCAPE. I get into the house and I drink some of my WHISKEY in a JAR but that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ease the pain clearly caused by the THORN WITHIN. At this point even i know the only solutions to deal with the STRUGGLE WITHIN. In the SMALL HOURS of the morning I stare into the dark night and see ORION, but now is not the time to think about ASTRONOMY the pain is too much it feels like I'm TRAPPED UNDER ICE yet I cant seem to convince myself that its my fault, betrayed by who i thought was a friend and betrayed by THE JUDAS KISS now I go towards my bed in this old rugged house, how am I supposed to sleep in THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT after I shot him between the eyes and left him STONE DEAD FOREVER and at that point it felt like NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. I close my eyes and try to sleep hoping it will all just FADE to BLACK but THE MEMORY REMAINS clear to me that I will always be UNFORGIVEN and it worries me because the things i just did make me wonder AM I EVIL. This cant be I was raised right how did I turn to this BAD SEED I know what I did was wrong but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel it, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like I am on ANESTHESIA.\n\r\nI had lost my mind when I decided it was KILLING TIME, I ran around taking them all out high on drugs I believed I was the INVISIBLE KID and the opponents I took out one by one where DISPOSABLE HEROES. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sleep so I stay up looking at the DIRTY WINDOW and start to think maybe its time I DISAPPEAR because right now I am CREEPING DEATH at any point the cops and feds will be all over looking for me. For so long I looked forward to exerting my revenge but that day seemed to be THE DAY THAT NEVER COMES nothing hurts more than taking the life of your BROTHERS IN ARMS. The pain was too much yet still I feel like the HERO OF THE DAY and I decided not to think about what others thought of me after all to the one who I was revenging I would always be the perfect PRINCE CHARMING her LOVERMAN as was the case when she lived and everyone else called me KING NOTHING. As my nerves began to calm I remember what MAMA SAID about salvation forgiveness trusting in God and THE FOUR HORSEMEN but I will not pray to THE GOD THAT FAILED seeing as he let my loved one die she truly was MY FRIEND OF MISERY so I decide to live the rest of my life with NO REMORSE.\n\r\nKnowing my fate as I step into the bathroom that bottle of CYANIDE seems appealing but I will not give up I will FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. Arrested I find myself locked in a SANATARIUM because the cops couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe any normal person could do what I did. The DEVILS DANCE is what they called it and maybe this is where I would spend the rest of my days on THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY. A brilliant mind I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deserve to be here but what i did deserves to be punished and that is SAD BUT TRUE. At this rate I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think even a priest can PURIFY my soul. I think of to myself POOR TWISTED ME but I decide to not have self pity because when it comes to who killed those men I will always be the ONE. From a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy RONNIE went on to become a killer and sometimes I would think SO WHAT right until the judge decided i would RIDE the LIGHTENING. I know I am SOME KIND of MONSTER but do I really deserve to die. The judge is not letting me off easy as he proclaims THAT WAS JUST YOUR LIFE and now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached THE END OF THE LINE. Alone in my cell I think it seems I have become THE OUTLAW TORN thinking about SUICIDE AND REDEMPTION what to do I cant let them kill me oh the STRUGGLE WITHIN talk about THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE. After a nights sleep I think maybe its fine after all TO LIVE IS TO DIE what is this THE UNNAMED FEELING maybe its time to TURN THE PAGE. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_108": "\nby the way...the song has NOTHING to do with any retarded movie\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
