Travis wrote a \"dating\" song about me. It was called \"Train Wreck.\" It says, \"You're just a train wreck and I'm a penny on the tracks.\" He sent it to me from L.A. That was like a shock to my heart. I thought, \"OK. All right.\" I was so angry about him writing a song like that about me. I thought, \"You know what? He's the one who left home and forgot about everyone. What about that?\" My mom and I were on the way to Houston. On the way, I got out my guitar and wrote \"What About Georgia\" in, like, an hour. That's my favorite of all my songs.\"\n\r\nOn her website she has an 'Ask Ran' section and I remember once someone asked her that same question about the bullet and the gun and she said it means do you still do everything your dad tells you to do like how a bullet goes wherever the gun points it. Hope that helps!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
