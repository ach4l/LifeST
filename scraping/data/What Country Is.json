Jimmy Rodgers was one of the first real country stars, whose career and life was cut short from tuberculosis. He was way back in the 20s and 30s and the fact that was so long ago along with his tragically short career makes it rather poignant that Bryan mentions him in this song, because Jimmie Rodgers at one time WAS country.\n\r\nGreat song overall\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
