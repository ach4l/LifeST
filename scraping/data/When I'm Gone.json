In his nightmare, Haillie tells him it's too late, \"go out there and show [the fans] that you love em more than us\", i.e. that he's been lavishing the love that he should've been reserving for his family on his fans.

But then again, so is everyone else who has even a small amount of talent in this gangsta rap wasteland. (Jay-Z, Tupac, and B.I.G) So naturally, since Em is more talented than most rappers, becomes big. (And it actually helps that he's white, because he's gained quite a following with cultureless caucasians, whether he likes it or not.) But this doesn't mean he can't have a few good songs. Well this is one of them. This is one of the few rap songs out there that really reflects the artist's soul, with its beats, lyrics, and energy. This, Slim Shady, and Lose Yourself are the only good Eminem songs out there. The others don't live up to those. \n\r\nOh, and by the way if you want to hear hip-hop/rap with ACTUAL meaning to it, you might want to listen to Gorillaz (Dirty Harry, Feel Good Inc., Clint Eastwood, etc.), Will Smith (First Rap Grammy, nuff said'[get Lost & Found]), or Kanye West (Diamonds From Sierra Leone Remix w/ Jay-Z, Jesus Walks, Hey Mama) who have stronger messages and lots of great songs.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_67": "\nshut up you eminem haters...eminem talks about real things..i'm soo sorry that he doesn't sing/rap about ur posh lifstlye like other artists..i don't really care what you guys think but keep your little comments to yourself.. if you lived where i lived and you constanly said $hit bot eminem you would get beat..so shut up!!!!!  this song is like the best song in my opinion.. if you think differently then good for you...\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_68": "\nThis is sort of about how Eminem can't seem to decide who he loves more, his family or his fans.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_69": "\nWalterbennet this is 4 u.

If hailey was this old when they first broke up,things wouldnt go ugly and they would have eventually patched up parmanently for sure.\r\n  And his plan for killin Marshal Mathers is the right thing for him to do.But on the other hand, it is Marshal  Mathers that earned him money to get Hailey on full custody.i guess he shoiuld just go Dr.Dre way, raise new stars and chillaxe@home with famileeeeee\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_72": "\nI don't know, but I think this song is a bit fake.

Eminem starts the song by directly describing the way his life is, and how he truly feels about it. The theme is about how the love of a dad hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t truly been found, and is needed. Eminem doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enjoy leaving Hailie to go perform, but instead he wants her to understand his departures. Eminem isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the best father, and isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always there for Hailie but he truly does love her. In a many different lines he has stated how he would do anything for Hailie including give his life for her. \n\r\nIn verse 2 Eminem describes everything that is going on with his daughter. Hailie says:\r\n                  \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making Mommy cry, why?

According to the line \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou always say that, you always say this is the last time\u00e2\u0080\u009d, this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the first time that Eminem had left her. Eminem tried convincing Hailie that he was going to come back to make her feel better but she had already noticed his lies. All Hailie wanted was to spend time with her dad! Even though Eminem wanted to be both things, a singer and a good father for her.

I believe the reason he's thinking these thoughts is either Kim got a devorce and took the kids with her which is supported by hailie saying \"fine me and mommy are leaving\" or Kim killed herself as supported by hailie saying \"HELP MOMMYS WRISTS ARE BLEEDING\" and \"earlier in the song she says \"why why is mommy crying\" and \"your making mommy sad\". \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_106": "\nthis is a great song because everyone can relate to the first verse. everybody has someone who they love so much that they would take a bullet for and has hurt in the past.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_107": "\nIt's a shame Em's career is fading.
