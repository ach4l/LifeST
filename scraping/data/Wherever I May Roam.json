A bass solo on a 1st album is rare.\r\nHighlights: The Four Horsemen, Whiplash, No Remorse, Seek and Destroy\n\r\nRide The Lightning: A+\r\nThe band was accused of selling out because this album was not Kill Em All Mk2. WHO CARES! Great album. all songs have a feel that fits them\r\nHighlights: For Whom The Bell Tolls, Fade To Black, Creeping Death, The Call Of Ktulu\n\r\nMaster Of Puppets:A+\r\nMetallica's best album. Unfortunately their last with Cliff Burton. Although he died 20 years ago, his music will always be remembered\r\nHighlights: Battery, Master Of Puppets, Sanitarium, Orion\n\r\n...And Justice For All:A\r\nTheir only political album so far. Has a few faults-some of the songs are a bit too long, the drums make a 'click' rather than a 'thud', and the bass is barely audible. But this is nitpicking really. Its a very good album\r\nHighlights:Blackened, Eye Of The Beholder, One, The Shortest Straw\n\r\nMetallica:A+\r\nPeople will debate about my rating, but there's more to this album than Enter Sandman. This song (the one i'm commenting on) is the best on the album. There's a mix of fast songs and some deep ballads, but unfortunately, some people only think Enter Sandman when this album is mentioned\r\nHighlights: Holier Than Thou, Wherever I May Roam, Nothing Else Matters, Of Wolf and Man, The God That Failed\n\r\nLoad: A\r\nNew sound, new image. The sellout accusations come thick and fast (seen somewhere before?). But the accusers could never see past the ends of their noses. Sure it's not as good as any of their previous albums, but its still good!\r\nHighlights: King Nothing, Wasting My Hate, Mama Said, The Thorn Within\n\r\nReload: B\r\nMore of a hard rock album. Also the first lyrically focused.\r\nHighlights: Fuel, Devil's Dance, Where The Wild Things Are, Attitude\n\r\nS & M: A+\r\nAlthough a couple of songs did not fit in (Sandman, Fuel) when played with an orchestra, the idea was a big success. The orchestra added more feeling to the ballad type songs, and made the heavier songs even more awesome.\r\nHighlights: The Thing That Should Not Be, Nothing Else Matters, Wherever I May Roam, One, Battery\n\r\nSt. Anger: B\r\nTheir most aggressive album since Justice. They wanted a raw sound, which they've achieved. Not a bad album, but it has several faults-the song are too long, Ulrich's snareless snare drum makes the album sound a bit too raw, and the songs lack of solos leave it feeling not 100% complete.\r\nHighlights: Frantic, Dirty Window, Shoot Me Again\n\r\nThe next album is showing plenty of promise-new producer, a return to solos, and a mix of the old recording way (start with demo tapes from all) and the new (everyone has a say in what becomes the final song).

'My body lies but still i roam' says human spirit is imortal. It also says that human imagination is a very powerful possession that can take you across time and space even when you lie in your bed.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_70": "\nI believe the song is about cliff and how he died on tour.  The road becomes my bride is how it started and carve my stone my bodie lies but still I roam is how it is now.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_71": "\ni love this song. my dad put metallica on all the time when i was a baby. and when my dad and step-mom's dog mobi died, i was listening to the song, and my dad sayed he was going to put the verse,\"my body lies, but still i roam\" on his grave.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_72": "\nI would like to know why enter sandman was such a popular song.it was alright but wasn't one of there more serious songs.but every body seems to like it when it was far from being one of there best songs.but most of the people i know that like this song are like hip hop,rap and r&b fans so i guess they dont have very good taste in metal.poor kids.metal is clearly the best genre of music out there.  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_73": "\nI beg to differ. When the song states that the road becomes my bride and later the earth becomes my throne, this is really a direct quotation of Satan claiming his dominion over the earth.\n\r\nIn fact, if you read the song by yelling them in your mind like you are making an argument it really sounds like someone or something is defending his (its) claim on something.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
