Heard Metallica's first but I like all versions... also, I have an x named Molly who crushed me pretty good and so I wanted to know if \u00e2\u0080\u009cMolly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chambers\u00e2\u0080\u009d meant anything, especially when I heard it in a kings of leon song.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cMolly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chambers gonna change your mind\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Anyway, I looked into what these lyrics might be all about and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I found take it or leave it...  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long one, I know but some of this fits together pretty well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\r\nas has been mentioned already by many, this is originally an old irish drinking song about a man who robs captain farrell, brings the money home to his girl, then gets betrayed by her and taken to jail. (he then breaks out and the last verse is about wanting to find his brother who will treat him more honestly than his girl did)... in that song though, its Jenny, not Molly. I admit that the name may have been interchangeable since lyrics of drinking songs are often changed by drunks like myself but at least in every version I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen of the original so far it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cJenny\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Obviously, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interesting to me since I was curious about the molly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chamber part of the lyrics. It made me ask myself, why would Thin Lizzy who I think did the first rock cover have changed the name to Molly and the verse to Molly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chambers (instead of my chambers or jenny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chambers)?  I started thinking that it might have something to do with the title being about alcohol or just being Fed up. An important point, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you can rule the fact that this song has something to do with booze out completely even if it is an old story song. If you know anything about drinking a lot, loving a girl and feeling betrayed, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty strong connection there, especially if youre a bit of a scoundrel yourself. So even in the original, I think the song is so good because its about all that stuff\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 anyway, I found the phrase in one other place - the book, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilas Marner\u00e2\u0080\u009d by George Eliot (actually a woman) and here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the excerpt: \n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust and self-reproving thoughts do not come to us too thickly, even in the purest air, and with the best lessons of heaven and earth; how should those white-winged delicate messengers make their way to Molly's poisoned chamber, inhabited by no higher memories than those of a barmaid's paradise of pink ribbons and gentlemen's jokes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\r\nFits pretty well. One message I see is: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done wrong yourself and then wrong happens to you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough to see that you brought it on yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the fact that the character in this book is hooked on opium and has a had filled with \u00e2\u0080\u009cno higher memories than those of a barmaid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wondering if \u00e2\u0080\u009cMolly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chamber\u00e2\u0080\u009d came to mean anything after this phrase and if it was a term \u00e2\u0080\u009cthin lizzy\u00e2\u0080\u009d  had in mind when rewriting the song. \n\r\nOr maybe George Eliot was making a reference to this old song\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a total coincidence\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but even if either of those is true and the use of the word molly is just random or a result of there being an alternate original version that uses molly instead of jenny \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this song is definitely about cheating, loving, drinking, being cheated yourself by a woman and being sad, which I think its safe to assume leads to more drinking\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 just because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a folk song doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no deeper meaning to it. \n\r\nOne more note: The Kings of Leon song (if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the band, you may remember the car commercial with the song in it) sticks to the original version of the story where the girl takes the guys gun powder out of his pistol and fills the charges with water. The lyric in that song is \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 your pistol.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Check out the song and the band for that matter, their first two albums are damn good.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_102": "\ni havent heard metallica's version but i have thin lizzy's. it was ok. it would defentently make more sense if metallica was actualy from ireland\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_103": "\nOk this is NOT the correct interpretation of the song, but when I first heard it, it meant this to me:\n\r\nSome (poor) guy is kicked out of the army (possibly for drunkeness), his \"boss\" or captain, was of course, \"Captain Farrell\". As he is heading back home to the only good thing in his life (his girlfriend Jenny/Molly) he sees \"Captain Farrell\", and knowing that his girlfriend will be pissed off when he comes home drunk, sacked and penniless, robs the fucker. When he brings the money home, she tells him she love him and she' never leave him.

This is what I believe they were thinking (Not necessarily the old Irish Meaning).\n\r\nHero (for lack of a better description) is a Pirate. Captain Farrell is a Pirate Captain. They make land after a Successful Pirate Raid and Hero seeks out finds Captain Farrell and \"produces his (1) Pistol and then his Rapier (Sword)\" (important point later). He takes the loot to his Molly and wants her to run off with him (he can't stick around, Captain Farrell will catch him if he does).\n\r\n\"Mush a Ring Dam a do dam a da\" is Molly stammering trying to think of how to deal with the situation, because, although she loves it when he comes off his raids with a dollar or two, she's not going anywhere with him. She gets the idea to stall the Hero until Captain Farrell can get there, by saying she doesn't want to leave without first saying goodbye to her Father:\n\r\nMolly says:\n\r\n\"Wait for my Daddy. Oh, there's whisky in the jar.\" \r\nHe grabs the jar of whiskey and Molly and starts for Molly's chamber and Molly says \"Oh\". \r\n\"Wait for my Daddy, Oh, There's Whiskey in the Jar, Oh\"\n\r\nWhen Captain Farrell enters Molly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chamber the song goes \"I jumped OFF, fired off my pistols and I shot him with BOTH barrels\". Remember eariler he produced his Pistol and then his Rapier. He only had one Pistol. The second pistol was his Cock, which Molly had been holding onto to prevent him from finishing the deed before Captain Farrell can get there. In support of this interpretation, the last trailing/fading out lines are \u00e2\u0080\u009cI loved, I loved, I loved my Molly and she was holding my barrel.

I'm sorry but the original song is so much better. or even the cover from the starlite singers isn't bad. But this is crap. I really think people should not go and ruin great songs like this. No offense to metallica because I like a few of their older songs but this honestly sucks. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_137": "\nThin Lizzy's version will always be THE BEST. Metalica's failed attempt is aweful. Thin Lizzy was a better band then Metallica and even Metallica admits to have been heavily influenced by Lizzy. Thin Lizzy's live album, 'Live and Dangerous' was voted the #1 greatest live album of all time. Chew on THAT one my little, headbanging friends. \n\r\nps, Lynyrd Skynyrd is way better then Metallica too.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_138": "\n\"Whiskay in the Jar-o\"....yeah great re-make you talentless ass clowns\n\r\nLars Ulrich is a COMPLETE DOUCHE!\n\r\nSad that ALL the talent in this band died on an icy road in 1986.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_139": "\nNo. Just...no. This song cannot be remade. Especially not by Metallica. It is not that kind of a song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
