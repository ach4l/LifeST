I think Eminem is a great artist, but he is nothing more than an attention whore like every other mouthpiece out there. Eminem isn't the next Thomas Paine and this song isn't the next Common Sense, if anybody catches my drift. I think the interpretation of liberals finally understanding the hypocrisy of government and the brutal suppresion of the Patriot Act is justified. I don't think it's going to bring about any great revolution. Commentators speculated that 1968 through 1972 was a \"great revolution\". It wasn't because the establishment remained in tact after it was over. When Jefferson penned the Declaration of Independence, he basically said that if the government was doing it's job, the logical end of it all was total overthrow. That won't happen because the government will call up the military and everybody will be gunned as soon as the mob reached the beltway. Eminem, Zack de la Rocha, and Bill Hicks all dream of sort of unique revolution that free us from the tyranny and corporate power but I don't think that will ever happen. Nature abhors a vacuum, especially one where power is involved. Somebody will always be corrupt and in charge because that's the nature of humanity, and we can't overcome it no matter how hard we try.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_69": "\neminem rocks, u queers suk\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
