{"comment_0": "\nI believe this song is about how women tend to keep things inside (hence the bookend reference) and when nobody is around they let loose and may have a side that they keep hidden from their significant other because of emotional reasons. The song is suggesting that he would like her to open up that side up to him more often, but has not yet discovered a way to remove those emotional \"bookends\" (that he perhaps gets a small glimpse of at times) without making her feel too vulnerable.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nI love this song.\n\r\nIt's basically about someone to everyone else, even their loved ones , they're composed and put together but when they're alone or not around anyone else, there's a whole other side to them that no one sees whether it be a fun side (sliding on the floor in socks) or an emotional wreck (stuffing your face with a box of chocolates) \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\ni tolly agree with cupcakesquisher. I wish both females and males would open u\r\np more and express how they really felt. The would have less wars i think.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nThis song is so amazing, it's actually the way I feel about everyone I like. I'm really interested in knowing what character they have when no one's around them, or who they really are. I believe that personality is much more loveable!\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
