It doesn't matter who you are- you're beautiful EXACTLY the way you are. And if someone tells you otherwise, they're not worth your time. This song carries the same meaning as \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Born This Way.\" You're amazing and perfect as you, so don't change or let anyone make you feel inferior. Love and accept you for who you are.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_8": "\nsooooooooooooooooooooooo cheeeeeezy\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
