{"comment_0": "\naww i love this song. i think the meaning's pretty obvious -- the guy constantly has fights with his girlfriend/love and he knows that he hurts her a lot and he always wonders why. he loves her, but always finds the most hurtful things to say to him.\n\r\nkind of makes me sad lol. i wish my best guy friend would finally maybe feel this way for me as he finds the most random things that hurt me.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\n**her not him\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\ni absolutly love this song.

Why does it have to come down to you leaving before I say I Love You???\" Cause you're an ASSHOLE!!! I'm sorry....it makes me laugh cause um....yeah\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nCos your mean and you don't care about anyone but yourself. :)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
