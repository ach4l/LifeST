{"comment_0": "\nOkay - yes, some of the things he says are a little \"risque,\" and he's over played, but anyone who appreciates music can tell you that Eminem is far and away one of the best MC's in rap at the moment.  He has an amazing ability to rhyme and he changes speeds with his rhymes like a true professional.  For the most part, his songs have a personal touch to them (IE, they're about his life, which, I might add, was not an easy one) which helps the listener to connect with what he's saying.  I hate rap (for the most part), but Eminem is kind of a diamond in the rough.  And for whoever said that Eminem is just living off Dre's beats, if you read the liner notes of the new album, you would know that only 3 of the 20 songs were produced by Dre and \"Without Me\" was not one of them.  So, if you're coming here to nay-say...I first suggest you learn to appreciate music as an art form, and also, obtain a sense of class somewhere and not go around posting heinous things about artists you don't like.  You can't hate him that much or else you wouldn't have even come here.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nwhy come here just to say you hate him you fuckin weiners\r\nnoone cares\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nagreed with beddall, you guys seriously have no lifes if you have to come here to diss eminem, go post positive comments on music you like\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nYeah, I'm kind of confused as to why someone would come to this specific page to READ the lyrics to a song they don't like by an artist they hate....Can anyone explain this phenomenon to me ?

No. Someone we'll remember in 50 years? No. Someone most people are familiar with now?

He complains about the problems, rants about a pissed off generation - and then does nothing to try and solve it! Just adds to the contention. On one hand I hope that someday he realizes what he's doing ... but for his sake I hope he doesn't ... he'll then realize what a miserable existence he's lead.
