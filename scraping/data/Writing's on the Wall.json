It's the song for the new(at the time) Bond film Spectre, and thus foreshadows the plot. I would go into a full in-depth breakdown, but it would spoil the movie. Though I will say this, the entire focus of the movie(and therefore the song) seems to be loss, and struggling to cope with it in the face of certain disaster. Great movie, great song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
