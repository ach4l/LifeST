We in the biz refer to long bus rides as a \"submarine ride.\" The first tour busses were the old school busses. The phrase \"many more of them live next door.\"is a referal to the crew bus. Taken in this pretext it's simply a song about life on the road. Most songs like this are taken from real life situations and are written from the perspective of everyday occurances. Most musicians live in the moment and are not as introspective as one would assume. Look for the simplistic and you will find most of the meanings to songs are just that, simple.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nI hate how everyone says its so simple, childish, and a bad song. it seems that way but it does have meanings,but no im not talking abnout how its about LCD and that its in the lyrics. that is totally wrong, (probably, you never know with the beatles.) because they did that in Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. so why would they do that in thius song too? that would be pretty wierd. but thats just my opinion.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\nOkay, I apparently understand a very different meaning for this song than everyone else, so I'm going to point it out:\n\nIn the town where I was born\nLived a man who sailed to sea\nAnd he told us of his life\nIn the land of submarines\nSo we sailed up to the sun\nTill we found a sea of green\nAnd we lived beneath the waves\nIn our yellow submarine\n-\"Where I lived there was a man who sold drugs and he told us about it, so we tried them until we were really high.\"\n\nWe all live in a yellow submarine\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine\nWe all live in a yellow submarine\nYellow submarine, yellow submarine\n-\"We are all really high.\"\n\nAnd our friends are all aboard\nMany more of them live next door\nAnd the band begins to play\n-\"So, because we liked it we told our friends and they joined us and now we are all happy and addicted.\"\n\nAs we live a life of ease\nEvery one of us has all we need\nSky of blue and sea of green\nIn our yellow submarine\n-\"And we are high, and everyone else is high too on the drug.\"\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_4": "\nA lot of people are saying this song doesn't have a meaning...

Fact of the matter is that Beatles revolutionized rock in hundreds of ways. Nirvana would have, of course, never existed if not for The Beatles. The Beatles bassicaly invented metaphoric and symbolic lyrics in deep layers. Well, may not have invented in the traditional sence, but they certainly made them useable, mainstream, and inspired masses of people to do so in the future.

They did everything from invent the internet, to get the Rolling Stones their start, as well as encourging them in all regards.\n\r\nBut yea, besides that: Yellow Submarine could mean manythings. It could of course mean drugs, as many of there songs were written while on them (seriously, dont try and act like they werent.

The fact he told them of his life could mean he was telling them how great the stuff was. 'sea of green' green is another word for grass, 'lived beneath the waves in our yellow submarine' could mean they thought more deeply into things (as marjiuana does), this was there first recognition of the drug and also things about life. \n\r\nAs the poem goes on it starts to become even more ironic. 'Our friends are all aboard, many more of them live next door' meaning that there  are people who also understand different things about life, the people who live next door are the people who have still to recognise these things. \n\r\n'As we live a life of ease' also has connotations of being stoned\r\n'Everyone of us has all we need\r\nSky of blue and sea of green' \r\nhere they are making us realise that material things mean nothing, just the simplistic things that make life such as the sky and the sea.\n\n\r\n2) It could be about isolation. The town where HE lived, and the MAN who sailed to sea, could be reffering to himself and how he feels isolated, he achieves this by using a strong metaphor 'submarine'. The fact that sumbarines.\n\r\nThe first 'stanza' is basically how they started to feel isolated, the 'sailed towards the sun', meaning they were looking for fame and to be recognised, then realised that having so much fame took away there private life 'till we found the sea of green'\r\n'and we lived beneath the waves' means they haveto keep there thoughts to them selves, below the surface. \n\r\n'many more them live next door' meaning they cant get to them, they feel isolated from there friends even although they are so close.\n\r\nThe last stanza is meant to be ironic, 'as we live a life of ease' as everyone knows that being famous isnt living life at ease. 'everyone of us has all we need, sky of blue and sea of green' shows irony as isolation has taken over him that they cant appreciate communciation anymore, the only things that they have/had any relation with is the sky and the sea.\n\n\r\n3) The song could mean the meaning of the song, if you get me?\r\nLike the beatles are showing how they get there meanings across through songs.\r\n\"And he told us of his life,\r\nIn the land of submarines.\"\r\nmeaning there telling us a story through the song deeper than we think.\r\n\"And we lived beneath the waves,\r\nIn our yellow submarine.\"\r\nwaves makes me think of 'sound waves', meaning they became dependant on getting there messages across through songs.\n\r\n'And our friends are all aboard,\r\nMany more of them live next door,\r\nAnd the band begins to play.'\r\nmeaning that there could be more than one meaning to there songs. 'and the band begins to play' could mean they want you to listen to it again and try and find out the other hidden meanings.\n\r\n\"As we live a life of ease,\r\nEveryone of us has all we need,\r\nSky of blue and sea of green,\"\r\nCould mean that they think that getting a point across through music is easier/more effective than making it blatantly obvious. They are showing how a simple song is all thats needed to get a strong point across '..has all we need, sky of blue and sea of green' the simplicity of the sky and the sea, but also the big capacity, and the fact that is all we need, shows the huge range of possibilities one song could mean to an invididual :-)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_138": "\nTo me, this song is about getting high with your friends (similar to With A Little Help From My Friends). lukefun interprets it about the same way I would.

Someone said that this song means to them that The Beatles can get away with making a silly song and it will be a hit.  Others said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about drugs and some said it means childhood and growing up.  For me, the song means, that is, what I think of when I hear it is that The Beatles can get away with a silly song (esp., having Ringo sing it gives it that silly, we don't take ourselves too serious attitude) and it will somehow make a lasting impression on their listening public.  Personally, I think the song itself is awful.  But what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so amazing is that somehow the Beatles are so damn charming, so damn clever and inventive and creative and just so damn good that a song as bad as this becomes one instantly recognizable.  It goes from bad and forgettable to a curiosity that is almost listenable.  It brings forth quite a bizarre imagery set and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m taken somewhere even if I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where.  For some it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to a place in which they want to impale things.  But for most of us, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a better place\u00e2\u0080\u0094childhood, the sea and its mystery, an adventure or to thoughts about what in the hell were they actually thinking with this one?  And to boot, they make a movie with its title.  Drugs?  Indubitably!  The English were so conservative, \u00e2\u0080\u009cprim and proper\u00e2\u0080\u009d I think they call it.  The Beatles (esp., John) were so irreverent, so cheeky, so New Britain, that they challenged everything holding them back.  This creative and unbounded energy created songs/movies Help!, A Hard Day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Night, and Yellow Submarine.  The last of which was helped in no small part by the psychedelic drug culture of the 60\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. This creativity (with and without drugs) didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come out all that great in their movies, but their songs trump all.  And this song represents for me all of these disparate elements coming together into a silly but poignant sign of  where The Beatles came from and played a fundamental and integral part in shaping music both silly and profound.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_146": "\ni think that the yellow submarine was a place the beatles had to go because they were known all over the world. they couldnt go out in public because they would be noticed.

Please do not judge me for my views, as this is the main fact that makes it worth while for us all to be on here and it leaves a slight distaste to one who is negatively critisized.\n\r\nCharles Manson was released from prison on 21 Mrach 1967. You have to have a bit of background info on Chralie, as they called him, to understand many of this, but C believed that there would at some stage, rather sooner than later in his time, be an uproar of racial differences in the US. (Long storie Short). \n\r\nWhen he was realeased he returned back to the ranch where himself and (Some call them his followers). It was the second ranch where they found refuge and it was called the Spahn Ranch or something like that.\n\r\nManson was adiment to start his own little town/city in the desert, and was sure that this would be a place where they all could survive in peace, when the civil war broke out. They could exist in such a darrn place, where no one else would be able to survive, not knowing how to. they started to accumulate all needed to build their city and Manson's plan was to create incredible music, aiming to be signed and recorded, to help fund his dream of having his own perfect city.\n\r\nThey practised, wrote lyrics, put songs together and became perfect at what they were doing. Eventually, as they felt they were ready, they set off to LA, to be discovered. (Keep in the back of you minds that, Beatles released their WHITE album in this time period, I think just before 1967.It was said that Manson was very influenced by them and that most songs on the WHITE album, was a direct communication from the beatles to himself and his followers.Manson sort of denies this though and said that it was some of his family that began to unravel the hidden messages in the songs) \n\r\nManson was acquainted with some guys in the music industry and his plan was to get in touch with one of them and they could arrange from there to be sampled in studios to perhaps record etc.\r\nHis main contact was out of time, when himself arrived in LA, but he was surprised to find out that the labell was speaking about them, but could not reach them, due to their desolate residence on the Spahn farm in the desert. \n\r\nCharlie then set out to find a place of residence for a short while, while they waited for this friend of him to return. (I think his name was Dannis) They needed a big enough place to house about 15 to 20 people and it needed to be close enough to where all the shit was going down in the industry they were so desperatly trying to break into. They found a house in Gresham Street, in Canoga park. About 30mins drive from hollywood and only a couple of miles away from the ranch. IT was quite spacious and guess what. The house was bright yello and had submarine like windows on the top floor. Get this, Charlie actually christened the house \"The Yellow Sub-Marine\". As they stayed there and became known, many guests would visit the house. At one stage the Beatles were often found, visiting the house. They would stay there at Charlies place, when in that part of the world when doing shows etc. \n\r\nThe house was described as a place that drew you in. You could go in so easily, but a week might quickly pass before you come out again, as you get so caught up in, not only the drugs , but the lifestyle that was reigning with it. charles was believed to have an incredible strong mind and motivational/manipulating qualtities. Charlie woud say that \"The family would remain 'submerged' beneath the awareness of the outside world\"\n\r\nThis my dear friends, was the yellow submarine that the beatles wrote about. \r\n - Budokan\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_238": "\nThe WORST song ever written/sung/performed.
