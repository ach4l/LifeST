{"comment_0": "\nI read most of the 104 comments about \"Yesterday\" and was surprised that nobody else picked up the same meaning of the song that I picked up.\r\nWhen Paul was about 12 years old, his mother died (at a similar time period that John lost his mother).  His mother and father both worked for a living, and the family was pretty poor.  In one book I read it was said that upon hearing that his mother died, he commented \"What are we going to do without her money?\"\r\nWhen we are young, sometimes we say things what we are thinking instead of saying what is politically correct.  Sure, he loved his mother, but he also was worried about the future as well.  In retrospect, he probably wishes he had never made that comment.  Before she was gone, his life was much better.\r\n\"I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday\".  Expand on that thought and that line, and you have the meaning of the song.\n\n\n\n", "comment_1": "\nLennon: \"I never went to high school reunions. My thing is, Out of sight, out of mind.

When in love you feel like the world is yours.  To have your love leave you (through something you said or no fault of your own) is a very crushing thing.  You would do anything to get them back.

There was this girl named Ali that I worked with, she was 23 so a couple years older than me. She was gorgeous, sweet, and really down-to-earth. When she started working and when I met her she was in a deadbeat relationship. With a little charm and wit, I expedited the process of breaking up with her then boyfriend. And from there we started to spend a lot of time together outside of work, and I even spent the night at her place a couple times. I knew she was really into me almost from the start and I really liked her too. It was a glorious time. Plus, how apt it was that we quoted Beatles lyrics together all the time. This went on for several months when summer came along. We were swimming one day and she popped THE question of if I saw her as a potential girlfriend or just a fling. I told her honestly from that I could see us being together. Literally overnight, she put up a wall and hardly spoke to me. When I confronted her about it she said that right now she wanted to have fun and be carefree right now (We all know what that means). I empathized with her wanting space and to enjoy being single before being in a relationship again, but to overcompensate the way she did was hurtful and I was lost in a whirlwind of confusion and frustration because I never in a long time would think I'd ever fall in love again. This song and The Beach Boys' \"Caroline, No\" remind me exactly of this predicament.\r\nLove was such an easy game for us two to play, my troubles seemed so far away when I was with her. Why she had to go, I don't know she would hardly say. I longed for yesterday; the beautiful times we spent together that I took for granted and the heart aching nostalgia that inevitably follows. All of this was so sudden and I believed that those times would eventually bring her back to me.

Not every song written has to break new ground or be startlingly complex but, my God, just listen to the tune in your head. It sounds like an exercise for kids learning to play an instrument.\r\nThen there's the words. Hard to think of a lyric so completely devoid of poetry. \"Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away now it looks as though they're here to stay\" is fine for a bit of dialogue in a soap opera but to say this belongs to the greatest song of all time hints at madness. The nearest the song gets to using some kind of imagination is the line \"love was such an easy game to play\" which, although nothing to write home about, is at least not dreadful cliche like \"there's a shadow hanging over me\". \r\nTo recap: Yesterday is a perfectly bland and inoffensive song made offensive, and perhaps grotesque, by those who believe it a work of genius or even perfection.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_74": "\nok mikeymike...does this mean you're challenging the man who can come up with an amazingly insightful melody in a matter of MINUTES (Elton John) when you say people who think this is the greatest song ever written have are no judge of music?  really now...whether you like Elton John or not, who described \"Yesterday\" as PERFECT, you can't deny that he is a musical genius.  so i'm going to trust him.\n\r\nand to what you said about imagination in the lyrics...sometimes something simple, honest, and pure speaks louder than something obscure but more \"creative\"...at least it speaks to more people.  i sincerely doubt that when you feel depressed or down, you think of an imaginitive way to describe it.  sometimes when you have as much emotion as paul did, the easiest way to say it is with simple words.  and then everyone will know how you feel.  he's no poet who's trying NOT to be understood.  and the music is amazing.  those strings....and the guitar.  they're beautiful.  i challenge someone to find a more pure, honest, and emotional song than this.  to me, that's the mark of a really great song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_75": "\nFor the record I, mikeymike111, hereby deny that Elton John is a musical genius.

In his yesterdays, there were mixed feelings, some of which he didn't even know he had!; things he didn't plan, things he didn't think about, they just happened. Paul thought he had already written the song, as though he was remembering it from the past but writing it today, so he believes in yesterday.  One minute, he's happily in love or going about his business and then something may go wrong.  He may feel that he's all messed up now, but no, he remembers all the yesterdays and so he has hope for the present and future.  He thinks he messed it up by saying or doing the wrong thing when he's not to blame.  He or someone made a choice not realizing how it affected others or may have hurt them.  He may not know how he will be or feeling, or what things might be like now or in the future had he made  different decisions.  Some people think that their past was better, and we can all think of times that we could go back to and do it better.  An \"if only\" sort of thing, a regret perhaps.  As a result, some things can help one grow/mature psychologically that otherwise wouldn't be on your mind, or that you wouldn't dream of doing again.  Or perhaps one will think something positive came of out it.  When he was young, troubles seemed far away but now he's thinking some of those things were actually troubling then (\"...there's a shadow hanging over me\"...) and he's troubled by them now.  He wants to hide from the past or the feelings of the past, or how they trouble him today, but that's not wise.  He's better to accept it as it happened and not to invent plausible reasons, speculations, conclusions or opinions why they happened just to feel better about it.  (rationalizing).  I think it's a sad song (perhaps the mistakes or missteps that were made), but at the same time, he believes in today because of what did happen.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_98": "\nThis song describes emotion we all can relate.

Golden Slumbers is another said song Paul almost recomposed verbatim. Paul went around for around two months laying down his little dream story about Yesterday, with Ham and Egg lyrics.
