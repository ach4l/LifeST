{"comment_0": "\nLove this song, one of my favorite off the new album. It's obviously about a special person in his life who is always there for him when he cannot keep himself together. It really means a lot to me, because I tend to loose grip of reality from time to time, and my girlfriend is always there to set me straight and hold on tight. Great song.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nThis is hands down Kenny Chesney's best song and it's not even close.
