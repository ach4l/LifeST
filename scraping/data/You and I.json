{"comment_0": "\nOne of my favorite songs...ever.\r\nHis voice is like butter and the lyrics are so solid;they're so sure that true love has been found and that it's never going to go away.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nthis song is about finding someone you want to spend your life with, but you feel a little hesitant because it never really happens the way you want it to be.  \n\r\ni think the middle portion talks about the idea of loss, either through separation or through passing away.  but the feeling of love can last way long after one has lost the other. \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_2": "\nStevie Wonder originally wrote and sang this song in the early 1970s. It's interesting to note that Michael's version leaves out 3 lines of lyrics.\nThe three lines that were omitted are:\n\n\"I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day,\nBecause that's all that I am living for, you see,\nDon't worry what happens to me.\"\n\nEither way, it's a fantastic, emotionally charged piece of music.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
