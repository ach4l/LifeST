{"comment_0": "\nThis song talks about how when people are young all they want to be is older.  Then when the older years come, they look back and realize they grew up to fast and that they wish they were still younger.  It shows that you should take life one day at a time and not take things for granted.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nPeople are as young or as old as they feel.

NOW.. \"With our Rock n' roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes \r\nHad no excuses for the things that we'd done \r\nWe were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly \r\nYoung\" yeah thats us.. right on the dot.. and we all cant wait to be older.. but i know as soon as i am \"older\" were gonna want to be young again.. ahh such a good song\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_3": "\ni know this is a \"song meaning\" website, but i just have to say that this song is AWESOME i love it!!!

I'd love to rebel, but i do have a clue... So it comes down to acting crazy once in a while instead of all the time :-)\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_6": "\nIronically when we are young,we wish we were older,then when we're older-we wish were younger.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n"}
