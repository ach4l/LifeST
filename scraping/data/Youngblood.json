{"comment_0": "\n\"Youngblood\" is another teen summer relationship anthem for 2018. We all can relate to the back and forth that 5 Seconds of Summer goes through in this young relationship. A very self-aware song, they even recognize that this is a problem that mainly plagues young people by putting it right in the title. I can just remember being that aloof teen over summer vacation stringing my crush along and giving them whiplash by going back and forth. In this song, the on-and-off relationship is ended and then started again during every chorus. Talk about indecisive! The song ends with the relationship being off again, and while my present-day self hopes that they're not going to try again on this obvious train wreck of a relationship, my teen self who loves drama just knows that the singer is going to end up going back and forth with his (now ex-) partner again throughout the fall semester.\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n", "comment_1": "\nWow.
