Such a fantastic song, one of my favorites.  A Brian May composition which is a bit of a departure from the power progressive style of Queen.  It's a science fiction tale which brilliantly employs a part of Einsteins theory of Relativity, time dilation.  Meaning as speed increases time expands; a week becomes a month, a month becomes a year, etc.   It tells a story of a group of space voyagers (the volunteers), who in the year of 39 (could be 2239, 2339, who knows) depart a dying Earth in a space ship to explore a distant world for habitability. Presumably a government project, essentially scouting the planet for colonization.  If they were to travel at speeds approaching the speed of light then the effects of time dilation would dramatically reduce the rate at which they age.  A year back on Earth could mean only a day to them physiologically.  If you follow the words you can piece together it took the volunteers 100 years to complete the mission, returning to Earth exactly one century later (in the year of 39 came a ship in from the blue).  It's the year of 39.... in the next century. 

Upon their return they discover the world they left no longer exists.  They have been gone a century yet the effects of time dilation has aged them only a year. Their families are long dead, the Earth has deteriorated to a gray planet.  They came back to report the world they explored is vibrant and perfect for humanity.  But their good news is quickly squashed by the realization that they are now refugees in time.  

The song seems to have a dual narrative; a third person perspective telling the tale of the voyage and their return underlying a first person conversation.  ""Can't you hear me calling you, though you're many years away?"" is an imaginary conversation between one of the volunteers and presumably his wife, speaking to her through space and time.  ""write your letters in the sand"", to me, seems to suggest leaving him a message etched in the earth he will see when he returns, perhaps a tree or stone.  ""for the day I take your hand in the land that our grandchildren knew."" is simply a longing to return to the time and place with his loved ones.  A land he knows his grandchildren will inhabit in his absence.  

I think the line ""your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me.""  suggest the voyager has met one of his children.  After so long it has to be assumed his child is now a centenarian.  And he is still a young man.  

""For my life's still ahead, pity me.""  means he is now alone and will live out the rest of his life displaced in time with no one.   

Lyrically the song does not give you all the information you would need to assemble the events or meaning of those events.  It only gives you enough to put together a long voyage and it's effects physically and psychologically.  What I love is the way it's intentionally framed as a sea voyage to a new land, not as a journey into space. Unless you knew ""though I'm older but a year"" meant a very specific phenomena of intergalactic travel, you would be confused by that.  But that is precisely what it is, and Mays knew enough about astrophysics to use it as the basis for a sad tale of loss.

			Yes, I can't believe how many people argue about what a song is about AFTER the writer has even explained it interviews (see Chicago, 25 or 6 to 4).

You may interpret it another way for you, but don't deny what the author has said.

Without doubt the lyrics deal with Special relativity and time dilation.  Curious?  Not given the source.  May has a Phd in Astrophyics and is currently the Chancelor of a 15,000 student University in London.  Clever fellow indeed.

I've heard about the star travel meaning for years;  never thought to look at it from the angle of the Volunteers being soldiers...  very cool interp.   Of course, the ""milky seas"" is very descriptive of the stars in the sky - heading deeper into the Galactic Center.  

The lines about writing letters in the sand, to mean man's impermanence, always gave me chills.  

""Your mother's eyes in your eyes cry to me,"" could mean that's confronting his descendants, or else he's returned to find his wife dead, and he's talking to his daughter.  

I also always loved the line, ""Don't you hear my call though you're many years away.""  As if the space between them is a span of years, not miles.  The location is the technical same, but time has pulled his wife away.

Yeah, I agree with Alieno too...but I don't think it's just one '39, I think that it must be two '39s. ""In the year of '39 assembled here the Volunteers"" This is the year when they left, possibly in 2039, probably not 1939 considering they didn't have rockets then. ""In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue"" Then this is the '39 when they came back, but you don't know how long they were gone for, so they could've been gone for 100 years, then it would be 2139, or maybe 500, or maybe even 1000 so it would be 3039!

@paradise ice 















Elvis was both a devil in disguise himself, because his mission was to corrupt and destroy the morals of the young people (the parents and older people mostly were disgusted by the provocation of Elvis. But that didn't stop them, they broke this resistance and the next generation could even be exposed to much more twisted things and so on.). And he signed a deal with the devil in disguise, maybe not even knowing that he was selling his soul. 

But Elvis was a tool anyway, an artificial creation like the Beatles, send to the masses to corrupt their thinking, to plant ideas of sexual immorality and party and worldlyness into their minds, plus he was a false idol that was and still is worshipped by many people. Though he wasn't a good person at all and he died poor and in misery after heavy drug use, though one should think he should have been a happy man, because he could afford everything that many people dream of. I always find it fascinating (but also scary) how obvious and in your face song lyrics get if you read them from a Christian and biblical standpoint. If you don't believe in God, you can always say ""this isn't real, it's a metaphor, he's just kidding, it's sarcasm"".

6,02 Panic Room.json,"
I think MuminPL is right on the money, I've never seen an interview with them before, but I noticed in one of their albums, they list Akira Yamaoka as an influence, he did all the soundtracks to silent hill.  
If you look at the lyrics to this song, everything points to Silent Hill The Room, 302 is the apartment that it's set in,(used to be my 302), and holes appear in the walls (peering through the hole) that the character travels through into Silent Hill,  the character finds that he is locked within his apartment and looks through the spyhole and watches his neighbours knocking on his door, i think the character has weird dreams too (reccuring dreams) and of course there's the darkness that is Silent Hill that manifests itself within the apartment.  
If you have seen the video aswell, there are visual elements that reference The Room, eg: a revolving door, decaying building, a bathtub (more SH3).
To summarize, although I am guessing, I think the evidence is clear.

I have heard of Riverside thru Myspace, They're unique and good.
So is 302 a room number? it's kinda confusing. I guess he was going thru something that turned out fake? :-\ so metaphorically speakin he was in a room sheltered and all but it was not where he wants to be, not where he belongs?
The final acoustic part is amazing, it explains itself.

@MuminPL 















I just think that 302 was the characters' university dorm room number, either that or apartment number. But I think dorm room because of the lyrics in Artificial Smile, in which he seems to be describing meeting someone in in university (and hating them and wanting them to fail)

This is quite possibly my favourite riverside song, which is interesting because rapid eye movement would have to be their weakest album. This makes me think of dreams, for those that have a strong attachment to their dreams, sleep and dreams can serve as wonderful and effective ""panic rooms"" to escape from reality, forget their problems etc.

			I really don't think this has anything to do with Silent Hill. The hole he is peering through is the peephole in his dorm or apartment door. And he is looking out in hopes of catching a glimpse of the girl he lusts for. The stuff about problems sleeping is just because he is a troubled man.

Ok so I am not really sure what this song is about, but I think the dude feels safe when he's asleep but must come to terms with himself while he's awake because he's tired of hiding from himself. Oh and 302 is the number you call when you want to put someone in a psychiatric facility, it's kinda like 911 but for the psych. hospital.

the song is definitely about silent hill. if you've played silent hill 4 you would see how the first part of lyrics explain the antagonist's situation in the game. but the second part of the song stray from the antagonist and , in my opinion, are the song writer's complementary interpretation to the life of one of the less centered, though compelling characters of the game,one of the neighbors.an portrait artist, who lives alone doing nothing but painting portraits of neighbors trying to capture the essence of their lives in each painting. although i love the silent hill music and especially in silent hill 4. i think this song is a very nice change of pace. a brilliant song for a brilliant game.

It sounds motivational, but at the same time it is almost like a warning for when you finally get to the top. ""What goes up has to come down"" sort of thing. But really I also see it like ""the grass is greener on the other side"" as well. You get what you want, and it's still not enough, because it's not what you need. You are trying to reach for something that isn't going to keep your cup filled.

9,"10,000 Days (Wings Pt. 2).json","
First, people really need to listen to TOOL, APC, and Puscifer and realize that Maynard Keenan, although very spiritual, is not a fan of organized religion.
The 10,000 Days album is not about religion, but a variety of topics, such as vicarious being about vicariously living out violence through TV (eye on the TV...cause I need to watch things die from a distance), The Pot being about hypocrisy (every line in the song pretty much being an analogy for hypocrisy), and Rosetta Stoned being an overdose from  X and DMT (10 to 2 AM, X and yogi DMT and a box of krispy kremes).
The song Wings for Marie, and 10,000 Days (Wings pt. 2), these very beautiful and powerful songs, are about Maynard Keenan's mother, Judith Marie, who suffered from a stroke that left her paralyzed and wheelchair bound until she died 27 years later, which is about 10,000 days, rounding up. He also makes a specialty wine named after his mother.

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize
Our way into the arms of the savior,
Feigning all the trials and the tribulations;
None of us have actually been there.
Not like you.

Many people spend their life rationalizing, trying to make a logical decision of what to believe in. Maynard respects his mother for going by her true feelings, or intuition, instead. people try to convince themselves to keep faith or believe in this or that. she actually experienced the ""light"" described by so many different schools of thought through her faith in Jesus. Even though maynard doesnt like the stories of jesus he cant help but respect and admire this ""light"". christianity isnt the only way to achieve it, probably the least likely way actually. all the more reason to respect his mother for it.

This is what maynard learned from his mother. to seek that light and live for it. he just chooses to seek it in a different way... ""a gift you passed on to me""

the feeling most people only ""read about""

she never lived a lie, she actually felt this spiritual connection to jesus. her set of beliefs says that in doing this she will be saved, go to heaven or whatever. thats why maynard says she can look god in the eye and demand her wings. Its an assurance that she did her part.

she saved maynards life by teaching him to trust his spirituality.

I'm a 16 year old guy, and a huge fan of TOOL.

I just want to say that this song has the most powerful lyrics of any song by TOOL. Hell, it has the most powerful lyrics of any song by anyone. In all honesty, after reading the lyrics along with the music, I was crying. Like actually crying. Don't get me wrong, but I've never been religious. But religious or not, this song truly sums up life and death. This is a beautiful tribute to his mother that delves into the unknown deeper than anything ever before. Producing a poetic masterpiece like this is an achievement no one should ignore. The time, the effort, the emotion that goes into creating something like this: it all just adds up to song that is nothing short of monumental.

@Aragotton LOL i'd say my comment from 7 years ago is nothing short of dramatic			

@drds63 - I think you may have taken the lyrics a bit too literally, from lyrics from this song and other it would seem Maynard is probably an agnostic if not an atheist outright (Set in my ways and my arrogance, burden of proof tossed on believers).  What I think hes saying, interpreted from that perspective, is that he hopes his mother is rewarded for her lifetime of hardship, belief, and faith, that if anyone is deserving of a reward it is her.

You're definitely right that he is holding her high on a perch, but come on it's his mom.  In other songs hes seemed to allude to her saving him (Reflection: ""I have come curiously close to the end"" ""Within my darkest moment, feeling weak"" ""As full and bright as I am, this light is not my own, A million light reflections, pass over me"") so she probably was very special to him, and this is his send off to her.

Haha...all the people that posted back in 06 thought this was a fake. Nope. 
Anyways this song is obviously written to Judith Marie, Maynard's mom. She was paralyzed for 27 years, or 10,000 days, but you already know all that.
This song serves two purposes: 1. As a eulogy to his mother and 2. as a way to call attention to the hypocrisy within the christian church. Judith was heavily religious and dedicated her life to God despite her being paralyzed. Maynard calls her a savior in herself because she is the only one, it seems, in the christian faith to follow the teachings so devotedly. He also says that the rest of the ""ingorant sinners"" are lost without her. The song also includes an account of what it would be like as Judith approaches the gates of ST. Peter.

When at her show only a few days ago she explained the song to us and she said that she used to have a boyfriend that would leave messages in the pockets of all her pants, usually saying things along the lines of “You’re beautiful, I love you”. And the audience thought it was so beautiful until she said “but unfortunately he treated me like s***”. She said that he treated her like she was nothing (hence the line ‘he said “one day I would realise why i don’t have any friends), and that it wasn’t for a really long time that she found her worth and what she believes she is, which was a lot more than her ex put her down to be (hence the line, ‘I said I’m not something to butter up and taste when you get bored’). Anyway, she said that months after they broke up she would still find all those notes in her pants and so she got jack of it and took every single pair of pants she had and threw them in the wash, hoping to drown every single note left, thus the line: ‘You wrote 100 letters just for me. And I find them in my closet in the pockets of my jeans. Now I’m constantly reminded of the time I was 19, every single one’s forgotten in a laundromat machine’.

You're all missing the point.

The reason why this song works so well is the fact that he tells a story, making the song Universal and Personal all at the same time. He lets the listener know he wants to address his personal issues with Hip-Hop but also allows a huge quantity of people to relate to the content of the song, the amount of people who find themselves in relationships which can be summed up be these lyrics can't be underestimated.

That, is why Eminem will always be up there with tupac looking down on the rest, he doesn't have to talk about shooting people and f*cking hookers to sell his music. He makes songs that can actually make a difference.

Awesome song but I really just want to address this illuminati junk that seems to be popping up on this site a lot.  My opinion is it's capital BS & a completely self-defeating  attitude to buy into the idea that theres a secret society controlling or planning to control the world.  An organization existed at one point but to blame current problems on a faceless idea or set of powerful individuals just allows problems to continue & basically to says you're powerless to do anything because someone or something else has more power than you & they control things.  I'm not one to discount peoples view but this idea is a large steaming pile of horse-shit & frankly is dangerous cuz it can suck people into a pretty paranoid, totally unproductive state of mind.

This is more than Kim, drugs, addiction, or hip hop.  This song is his way of representing ALL of his past struggles and pains.  This includes Kim and his addiction issues.  It includes the fans who left him and the public's campaign against him and his music.

I think the reason he said ""Fuck you hip hop"" is because hip hop is his whole life, not just a music genre.  People like Eminem live their art, so I think this song was not only hip hop, but everything else in his life.

But that's just my two cents :)

The only other person (that i know of that is) that has done that is common, his track is titled ""I used to love h.e.r."" check it out. They're very much the same in theory. but differant in practice. Eminem's is a more emotional lashing out at how the industry had treated him badly and hes fed up, com's track is more of and explanation of how he was introduced to rap and the way it was swept up and embraced (for better or worse) and how he used to love the way rap was, and wishes it hadnt turned commercial.

If you know eminem you know that he hates the fact that he cant go out in public so he began hating the rap game which led to a life of drugs and depression. It became too overwhelming and it started to control him. This is eminem's way of saying he is going to do what he wants now

			i think everyone is over thinking this. Its not about kim at all. Nothing on recovery is. Its about his life as an artist his life in the spotlight as a hip hop artist. If you know eminem you know that he hates the fact that he cant go out in public so he began hating the rap game which led to a life of drugs and depression. It became too overwhelming and it started to control him. This is eminem's way of saying he is going to do what he wants now			

			its not about rap its about the illuminati!!!			

you people are idiots this song is about the trials and tribulations of being in the rap game not stupid illuminati bullshit you paranoid fucks

@n8rapper 















This song is about his 'relationship' with hip-hop. 
A few verses that point that out:

'i gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you' -- We all know how long Eminem has been a rapper. 'Nuff said. 

'dont think im loyal, all i do is rap' -- Self-explanatory.

'but in my sickness an addiction, you're addictive as they get' -- Eminem was a recent drug addict, (Hence the album title, 'Recovery') but, this completely stats that rapping is his ultimate addiction.

'go marry someone else and make em famous' -- Kim obviously isn't going to make anyone famous, however being a rap artist will..

'fuck you hip-hop' -- Well, yeah.. 

And lastly, the chorus:

too late for the other side
caught in a change
25 to life
too late for the other side
caught in a change
25 to life

Eminem's first album titled, 'Slim Shady LP' released in the year(s) of 1997-1999; When he was 25. Hence the lyrics, '25 To Life'. Ironically, it is also the life sentence of imprisonment. Thus being, his life sentence to rapping.

Not about Kim, Drugs or the 'illumninati'

21,"A Car, a Torch, a Death.json","
21P are not always straight-forward with the meaning in their songs, which I think is purposefully done so the audience can form their own understanding of it based on personal experience. What I took from it is that this is a song about a man that is romantically involved with a woman whom lives very far away, and  she feels dangerously unhappy when he is not around (when he's driving away from her house, he want to go back because he knows she will fall apart in the absence of his presence, hence the ""I begin to envy the headlights driving South. I want to crack the door so I can just fall out."") When he ""understands why God died"" and ""takes the grave, sending her demons his way,"" he is saying he will attempt to mend her, but knows that this will cause conflict and pain upon himself, which is a great sacrifice. John 3:16 says ""For God so loved the world He gave His only begotten son that all who believed on Him should not perish but have everlasting life."" This is along the same lines of.  I think the lines ""And when my car was far out of sight, he (the demons) crept in her room and stayed there for the night"" mean that every time he leaves her she is hit with a depression and severe sadness, and when he says ""He layed it out, what he had planned,"" he is saying that they both know that she will go into a deep sadness when he leaves. The beginning and end, from ""The air begins to feel a little thin"" to ""I began to understand why God died"" are saying that she gave him her all, but in doing so, it pains her to be without him. He is reassured by her love but is saddened by her sorrow.

When I really listen to this song as I have many a time, and knowing top I really don't think its about a girlfriend at all. Tyler said in one of his recent interviews that Tear In My Heart was the first song he wrote about a girl because they were married and he knew that it was forever. Of course this is my own opinion but I believe this song to be about a mother or a sister, not necessarily his but a mother or sister. Artists a lot of the time draw from their own experiences but sometimes they will write about something that actually has never happened to them. When I imagine it I think of a mother so I'm going to use that. I think the mother is sick and she tells him its okay to leave her so he goes home reluctantly, wishing he could be back there to take care of her. She gave him her heart to take with him. When he says ""the demon stood there waiting on her porch"" the demon is the grim reaper symbolizing death. The song is called a car, a torch, a death. When he drives away for the night death swoops in, starting to take her. He feels chills in his bones. When he sees her and her life is nearing its end (because Tyler is actually religious) he sees God with a torch to guide the way for his mother and Tyler sees what he has planned then he tells God he'll ""take the grave"" as in take her place and die for her as Christians believe Jesus died for us. ""Please just send them all my way"" refers to her demons. He would rather take them then her hsvig to face them all. ""I began to understand why God died"" means he knows what its like to love unconditionally and so deeply for someone you would take all their pain and burdens and put it on yourself even if it means your life. His mother is very very near death and it's almost morning. Before she dies she gives him her heart to keep. 

Anyways that is my own personal interpretation and the beautiful thing about music is there are endless possibilities to how to interpret music and its unique to every one of us. I just wanted to share why this song is special for me.

I haven't completely figured out the meaning to this song yet, but I have a strong feeling it has absolutely nothing to do with a girl or a romantic relationship.  Knowing that these guys are Christians changes my original interpretation. 

""The air begins to feel a little thin
As I start the car and then I begin
To add the miles piled up behind me
I barely feel a smile deep inside me""

Starting the car is starting his new life as a Christian who is now accountable for his actions.  He's realizing that he is now an adult and is accountable for his actions to God and is adding up all the sins he's accumulated in his past, ""the miles piled behind me""  and when he thinks about all he's done against God he's not feeling too good about it which is why he ""barely feels s smile deep inside.""

""And I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I want to crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart""

The headlights driving south are the majority of people heading ""south"" , south being a metaphor for Hell.  Living a Christian life is difficult, especially if your a rock star, he's finding himself being envious of those around him enjoying the pleasures of sin.   He's almost ready to succumb to sinful desire when he says ""I want to crack the door so I can just fall out.""    But then he remembers who he is in Christ and that when he made his commitment Jesus came into his heart when he says ""But then I remembered when you packed my car.""   His transformation to Christianity was true and Jesus has taken over his heart, and thus the line ""You reached in the back and buckled up your heart. For me to drive away with.""  He now understands why Jesus died for his sins when he says  ""I began to understand why God died.""


""The demon sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark so he held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night""

This is where it gets a little trickier to interpret but I believe when he says ""The demon sat there waiting on her porch"" he is referring to Satan constantly waiting just outside to creep into our lives at any moment.  Even when deep down what we want to do we know is sinful or ""dark"" Satan has a way of convincing us that it's actually a good thing but convincing us with a false sense of ""goodness"" which is the makeshift torch.  Remember the car, his life, has been packed with the heart of Jesus buckled in back.  He let his guard down when he says ""when my car was far out of sight"" which allowed Satan creep in a stay a while.

""And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own""

He succumbs to sin and realizes that he's been deceived and that what he's doing is not really who he is in Christ, his own breath is not his own but Satan's influence over him.  

""I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game
And then I saw Him, torch in hand""

He realizes he can't play this sinful game and still be a Christian, he's not made to live in this sin, he sees that Satan deceived him with the makeshift torch of false goodness.

""He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said, I'll take the grave
Please, just send them all my way""

Satan reveals what he has planned with the pleasures that he can have in this world continuing to live a life of sin, but he finds his strength in Christ and says he will take death before he chooses a life that denies Christ and basically tells Satan to ""bring it on"" because he's found his faith again.

""The air begins to feel a little thin
As we're waiting for the morning to begin
But for now you told me to hold this jar
And when I looked inside, I saw
It held your heart,  for me to walk away with""

Even though the car previously drove away when he let his guard down, Christ continually renews the Christian reminding him that the heart of Christ is still with him and cannot ever be taken away from the truly saved.  

""I began to understand
Why God died""

He's understanding more and more the necessity of why Christ had to die on the cross.  

Of course the song was written in a way that will allow the masses to have multiple interpretations but only someone familiar with true Christian theology will get the meaning that the author had in mind for himself when he wrote the song.

@robertgxl 















This is clearly religious in a sense, I also think it was one of the very few romantically related songs by Twenty One Pilots.

I think it's about a girlfriend/wife cheating on her boyfriend/husband and the pain it caused for the boyfriend/husband. (I'll try to keep my religious views out of this) Biblical text references that God died because he loved the world. In this situation, the boyfriend/husband understands that because he loves his girlfriend/wife and that's why he wishes for death.

Personal interpretation, just my opinion. That is all.

I see this as him leaving a loved one for the last time as they are in the final stages of dying or just passed. Once on the road he is overcome with grief and considers killing himself, but then sees god. God explains that he has a plan for everyone and the death was part of it. The narrator asks god to take him instead, which is why ""he understands why God died.""

To understand this song it takes a little understanding of Christian theology. Tyler says he understands why God died. In Christian theology Jesus, who is also God, died to save us from sin.

In this song the main character is worried about a woman he cares about. 
""I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I want to crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and buckled up your heart""

It hurts her when he's gone and her personal struggles grow worse.
""And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night""

He cares for her so much that he would sacrifice himself to heal her hurts. This is why he knows why God died. He understands the pain of watching someone you care about suffer and therefore understands sacrificing for them.
""And then I said, I'll take the grave, please, just send them all my way""

"
22,A Day in the Life.json,"
I believe the structure of the song is crucial to understand what it means;

the first part is about laying in bed, waiting to fall asleep, thinking of the day that is about to finish. he thinks of the irony in life, he can't help but laughing at someone dying in such an absurd way, after ""having made the grade"" in the life. the orchestral section is the moment when he falls alseep, with so much meaningless thinking going on (beautiful how the last thing he thinks is his loved one, and how he would like her to be there with him).
Then he suddenly wakes up and starts his day routine; he has to hurry, no time for thinking; but then he smokes, and while people are talking about something he probably doesn't really care about, once again he goes away with his mind just like when he was about to sleep (""i went into a dream""), and again the orchestral section is the division between the everyday world and the world he has in his mind. Yet again, the last thought that comes to his mind is her... He'd love to turn her on...

Sorry about my poor english, i did my best

John contemplating a world that is quickly devolving and coming apart at the seems.. while at the same time moving into interesting new frontiers..  and his response to all of this is that of a slightly passive, stoned, outside observer...  his reflections are filtered through the world of media and art, all of which were in the process of becoming increasingly innovative and pervasive in everyone's lives.  The disinterested quality is kind of a product of that and, to my mind, was something that continued on through many years later, into the 90s, with the 'slacker' label we all got (rightfully so, perhaps). I wonder if there is also a subconcious thought he's having here about whether his contributions to this new emerging 'art', and that of his contemporaries, is really helping the situation, or just making it worse.  He was always so smart like that, being able to see both sides of the coin when it was most critical to have done so, but also when so few people actually were able to like him.  So, at the end of the day, I think this is a song that contemplates a life of confusion, bewilderment, ecstasy, ambilivence, engagement, tempation, violence, brilliance, all converging on eachother simultaneously... that's why you hear the cacophy at the end.. but remember, that's followed by the incredible 4 beatles all hitting the same chord on the grand pianos in unison (then followed by a loop of weirdo beatles chatter if you have the actual LP).  Good stuff.  Hardly gets any better.

""He blew his mind out in a car""
The car crash is about Tara Browne whose father was part of The House Of Lords. On 18 December 1966, Browne was driving with his girlfriend, model Suki Potier, in his Lotus Elan through South Kensington at a speed over 100mph. He failed to see a traffic light and proceeded through the junction of Redcliffe Square and Redcliffe Gardens, colliding with a parked lorry. He died of his injuries the following day.

""I saw a film today oh boy. The English army had just won the war""
John was in the film, How I Won the War which was about an inept British WWII commander who lead his troops to a series of misadventures in North Africa and Europe. Both the movie and song were released in 1967.

""Woke up, fell out of bed""
This part was written by Paul and it describes a typical day for him when he was a teen living in Liverpool. He often took the bus around town because of the proximity of the bus stop being but a few feet from his home.

""I read the news today oh boy. Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire""
John had read in a newspaper that there were enough holes in the local roads to fill the Royal Albert Hall. Four thousand holes, to be exact.

""Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire""

			the Blackburn reference is to a major redevelopment which was ongoing in the town centre  in the 60's.There were massive construction works and the town centre was full of holes,some of them enormous, dug as part of the various projects.A national newspaper at the time had the headline that the holes in total were the size of the Albert Hall,a well-known London theatre.Believe me,I lived thru it.At the time of release in USA the song was briefly banned in some areas because the word 'holes' was thought to be a drug reference.

A Day in the Life can be looked at as a criticism of our own society. In the song, three key events are depicted; the man who died in the car crash, the movie about the English winning the war, and the holes in Blackburn's roads. For each one, the lyrics displayed the public's reaction to each occurrence. After each piece of negative news (in this case the gruesome car crash and the holes), the people could not get enough of it. ""A crowd of people stood and stared"" at the horrifying car crash, and the attention to detail was so great on the story in Lancashire that every hole in the streets was recorded and then relayed to the world. These pieces of negative news which amassed great attention contrasted to the movie about winning the war (a positive event in history because this song was written by UK writers), which received little to no consideration. ""A crowd of people turned away"" from the movie, thus highlighting the public's boredom with good news. The message of this song is that the news has turned our society into a world of cynics. Our news outlets feature only the ills of our time, always leaving out any sort of favorable news. This is the reason why after every time in the song when it said ""I read the news today"", it was immediately accompanied by an ""oh boy"". When was the last time you read news about a policeman who saved a man's life? Or about a child who beat an illness and survived? Our news instead is dominated by current atrocities; our ugly government and state politics, corrupt police murdering innocents, hate crimes, etc. We all have societal cravings to see the worst in our world. But we have to remember that we can't just look at the dark; there must be times when we can shed light on the good in our world.

@JohnPhillips 















Many have noted the meaning of the small facts, strung along the way. What's the big picture?

John's reading the newspaper. An impression one can't miss at the beginning is the contrast between John's unemotional vocals and diction and the first news item, about a man dying in a car crash, and people being unsure if they know him or not. The alienation of the people from the victim, and the voice of the singer (John, at this point) is jarring. The singer is emotionally dead to what's going on around him.

As he discusses the film, the unemotional tone continues. The singer doesn't respond to the power of death or war.

When Paul takes over, we get a man (the same one who read the news?) rushing to get to work. In the middle of it all, he loses focus on what's going on around him, and goes into a dream. Again, a man detached from life.

John comes back singing (as the same persona?) with another news story and resuming the flat tone.

The final line, which occurred once before, is the most significant statement: ""I'd love to turn you on."" John's voice warbles teasingly, calling the most attention to this line. Turn you on…with LSD? It doesn't matter. The problem with the persona (or personas) in the first 90% of the  song is the detachment from what's going on around him (or them). The statement of the song, the album, and possibly the Beatles' career is that they'd like to wake people up from that detachment.

What this song is about isn't the details of the three or four small anecdotes. It's about the detachment, in John's and Paul's two different ways of narrating it, and how they'd like to turn us on. And for my money, the song, at least in some small way, accomplishes that.

I've always thought the song starts with ""About a lucky man who made the GRAVE"" which made the first verse be about suicide. The narrator reads the news about a man who had shot himself in a car while perhaps he hadn't noticed that his terrible situation had changed (to what the traffic light might allude to) and thus the situation is ironic/funny – the man shot himself too early to realize things have resolved already. The shot makes his face unrecognizable and so people stand and stare out of shock, wondering if he is ‘famous’.
The narrator continues to tell about a movie that he saw and while people couldn’t bear to watch it, his interest was deeper and he continued till the end. This sets him apart from “crowd of people” once again. The line “I’d love to turn you on”, is what lies underneath all this distancing from the “crowd”, the man is in love and all the news/books/movies are just a façade of interests beneath which are the thoughts about the girl he wants.
The song switches to another narrator who is more upbeat and whose life is more structured and a little more stressful who does not have time to think about either a woman he might love or the news. His life revolves around the mundane activities of life.
The song switches back to the first narrator where he continues to leaf through the newspaper where he notices a peculiar story that he finds funny. But once again, beneath it all are the thoughts about the girl.

This is very much Johns swan song. And although it could make more sense starting from the end & going backwards, the point he makes is quite clear. 

Yes, he is talking about Potholes, but makes an omission because he believes that the upper class in the House of Lords consider the people who live in a shit-hole lesser than a Grade A Politician. And further then refers to people as ""holes"" by jesting that somehow poor people aren't good enough to understand music; the Albert Hall had a capacity of about 4,000 seats back then. 

He also expresses his disdain for War, for people who turn their backs & bury their heads in the sand whilst keeping the typical English pride in winning wars, as well as hinting ""I'd Read the Book"" - as in Manifesto, which subsumes his initial remark ""Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords"" the very people or person who start wars, most potentially could have been distracted by one of the Potholes & got killed on the road.""

""I Had to Laugh"" merely reassures the listeners that if the Rich don't care about the poor, the poor aren't about to care about them. Even from a human perspective. 

""I'd love to turn you on"" is a play on words once again. At first, it would appear that John is being cheeky as usual! But he is also saying very covertly to those who introspect ""I'd love to turn you on to these issues"". 

It's the only line he repeats & is a metaphor for the whole song. The Orchestral [orgasm] Crescendo is a clandestine statement that we can either make love, or war. [With the end of the song representing a Nuclear Explosion] 

Paul's section is merely there to play out as a philistine; a servile Joe worker who just daydreams his life's journey away with all the other passengers travelling in the same direction; ""being taken for a ride"". 

In a nut shell, John is unhappy with all the things that segregate us & wishes everyone would stop long enough to come out of the dream. He had a point back then, & it is fundamentally quintessentially relevant now more than ever. 

If only he had know about The Venus Project back then. I think he would have supported it :) No Poverty, Greed, Politics, or War? Who wouldn't want that?

Paul's my favourite Beatle for some reason, I know his earlier lyrics are often about love and are pretty cliched. But his later ones were experimental too, it's just that John was more innovative and went along more psychedelic routes. However, most of the *really* famous Beatles songs are by Paul (Yesterday, Hey Jude). Both John and Paul are important to the Beatles though

""I watched you glide out the door with poise I'd not seen before."" he is saying that she left simply and it didn't bother her she was calm and had moved on, ""I saw you shine, you shine."" he is saying that she went on with her life kept living, kept shining. ""I collapsed to the floor. It promised it missed me more"" he is saying that he fell to the floor in dismay that she was gone and that this was not his first time there he is saying that he has better connection with the flor then the girl that he is used to being broken hearted and she/(him being happy) was a rarity ""and said, ""true love is mine. I missed you did you miss me?"""" the floor is saying that his love belongs to it, that he will never truly love another girl and that he will forever live with heartbreak, and that is something he is realizing as it asked if he ""missed it"" as it had ""missed him"". ""slowly, its consuming me, deliberate and deep.i can't take this deeper panic. Teach me. Teach me not to dream, dream deeply."" now he is saying he is being consumed by a panic that runs trough him thinking about her and he can't handle it he is asking to be taught ""not to dream"" he want to learn how not to hope probably for fear of being hurt again. ""I haven't left here for days. My panic keeps me awake"" he is saying he has been stuck at home (on the floor) and all he can think about is her, he can't sleep because of his thoughts or do much of anything. ""as he unwinds inside."" he is saying that another part of him is coming alive or awakening maybe his common sense (or most likely his sorrow) ""he told me I should of known, that he'd hated the way I'd grown to love soft lies"" he is saying to himself that he was foolish and love had blinded him to her lies and he hates himself for that. """"she lied. Do you miss her like I missed you?"" he is saying he realizes all her lies and asking himself if he really misses her and how he was happy with her even if it was a lie and how when he was happy if he missed his sorrow and loneliness that was the truth. ""slowly I swallowed your fears for all of those years. How could you let them consume me?"" he is saying that he took care of her and helped her and asking how could she let him fix her and make her promises then leave him with all of her problems that he fixed. ""teach me. Teach me how you dream so sweetly."" he is asking how she can sleep and still dream after what she did and he is wishing to dream again, to be happy and look for something good in life

I'm, first few lines he's obviously complimenting a woman. It literally made him clasps. Nest you can tell it's someone who he knew before, he could be collapsing because it was someone he was over, and now they're back. And he knows he'll give right back into her. And next, you can tell that it's consuming his life all over again. And some part of him knows that she's doing this deliberately. ""Teach me not to dream deeply"" he's saying tell him how to not get his hopes up, because they'll be knocked down. Next he says ""I haven't left here for days. My panic keeps me awake."" A few AFI songs have to do with is sleeping disorder(s)  So what he's feeling is so bad he can't sleep. ""He told me I should had know"" next another man had been trying to tell him... ""That he'd hated the way I'd grown to love soft lies."" Here this person wanted Davey to love him, not the lying girl that was hurting him. ""She lied"" he loved lies - he loved her. The man tried to tell Davey that she was no good and that he loved him, but he wouldn't listen. ""Do you miss her, like I missed you?"" He could be asking if there's and love Davey could give him, because he still loves him. Or, it could be that he's asking if she's worth it. And that he doesn't love him anymore so it's being used as a past tense. Then the chorus comes around and now he's panicking because he figured out that he was right. And he can't fix it. ""Slowly I swallowed your fears, for all of those years? How could you let them consume me?"" He's talking to the girl again. Asking her why'd she do this to him when all he'd ever do was help her. ""Teach me how you sleep so sweetly"" could be him asking how she could still sleep at night after what she did. Or, she hurt him so bad, that his insomnia is coming back and he can't sleep, but it's not fair that she can when Davey doesn't deserve to be kept awake with this pain. Of course, this girls, could be a metaphor for something. Possibly cutting himself. I highly doubt it's drugs. And maybe the guy was telling him he needs to stop because he loves him. And in the beginning, he could be having a relapse. Because she/it is coming back into his life. That's how I see it. Thanks for reading, I know it's long. :)

Sometimes when an older band releases an album, you're incredibly underwhelmed by it. So when said band release another album, you're hesitant to listen because you gave up on them releasing quality new music. However, when I listened to this, I knew that it wasn't quite over for AFI just yet. Burials is a solid record, much better than Crash Love. I'm not entirely sure what happened there...

I like this song because I can relate to it and I draw from my own experiences when I hear it. It seems like Kenny isn't just toying with the idea of changing things if he could, he literally wishes he could.  He doesn't explain why that is. That implies he feels he would have enjoyed life more had he done things differently. For myself, I just think it's an interesting concept to reflect the past and wonder how much different lifewould really be if you had second chances. I think that is the best part of the song - it makes you think and touches a special note with those who like to reminisce. I personally wouldn't change a thing. :)

Correct lyrics:

Can you feel me
When I think about you
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place

Like I've been wandering the desert for a thousand days
Don't know if it's a mirage, but I always see your face, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind
Can't you hear me calling
My heart is yearning like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me, I'm falling

It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me, oh, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me, baby, baby, baby
It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
And I need you here, I can't explain
But a day without you is like a year without rain

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain

			Close, anlota, but more explanation is needed. Guru Dev was Maharisha's guru. Anyone who has practiced transcendental meditation knows that because it is included in the initiation ceremony. This was Maharishi's way of showing reverence to HIS teacher and to thank him for teaching the meditation technique. That phrase is NOT a mantra. I can tell you that each Beatle received the exact same mantra from Maharishi. It was a one-syllable Sanskrit word, which also happens to be a word in the English language. However, the word ""OM"" by itself IS a mantra, mostly used by Tibetan Buddhists, but is frequently used the same way Christians add, ""Amen"" at the end of prayers.

I really love to listen to this song.  I'm quite sure what he is actually referring to when the song was written, but my interpretation would be the following:  Perhaps there is hope for peace or love through words and thoughts.  Maybe such words of joy, happiness and even sorrow are contagious.  ""Words are flying out like endless rain into a paper cup, 
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe.""  I think these words encourage the belief that such words of meaning and feeling, when spoken, can be passed on from person to the next just by the very sound of them and thoughts of them.  The very idea that love or sorrow exists, allows for love or sorrow to actually be.  Pass it on, those feelings and thoughts. ""Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing 
Through my open views inciting and inviting me. 
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns, 
It calls me on and on across the universe"" -here it is explained how he is surrounded by words of feeling and hope.  encouraged by words of all people around the world.  not just a certain race or religion....just the kindness of humanity across all of the universe.

I think this song is, most of all about about achieving a state of mind where you no longer need to think, where your thoughts, your words and your concerns go away. It's about our lack of importance in relation to our world, our universe. It ridiculizes earthly worries, and urges us to open our senses and feel. Just feel everything around us, below us and above us. Become one with the universe and everything around us, lose our individuality and become unviversal. 
The images in the first lines of the song represents this lack of importance of word, talking and worrying in general, “Words like endless rain into a paper cup”, paper cups can never keep rain inside of them, they are uncapable of holding them as we are uncapable to hold onto words, so he let's them go, “Slip away across the universe”, through meditation, that feeling of your head going “blank”.  
The next verses are about the feelings that fill overwhelm him, when he achieves that state. About letting everything into you, the good and the bad, and at the same time letting nothing affect you. 
Embrace everything but remain unmoved, loving everything and accepting this things as inevitable and almost neccesary. “Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, Possessing and caressing me”, opening your mind is the key element here. Then there's the mantra, it doesn't matter what it means, for me it's related to the way of getting into that state. “Nothing's gonna change my world” may sound a little selfish, arrogant and close-minded at first (at least for me) and even more if you look at it as a sentence on its own. 
But if you relate it with the context of the song (buddhist meditation) nothing's gonna change my world is really about accepting the world and the universe as it is, feeling happy and calm about it, wanting nothing more and nothing less of it. For me, it's more about not WANTING to change the world, not needing to do it, than not LETTING anyone change it, as a way of defending it or blinding ourselves. It's the same sense of peace, tranquility, conformity and of communion with the self and the world of the entire song. It really embodies the entire concept. It's almost the inverse of being selfish, it's about abandoning one self and becoming whole with everything that's outside of us, achieving inner peace. 
The verses that follow this chorus, ""Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,"", in my opinion are much more open to interpretation. For me, these images are a metaphor of the stars, of the open universe in it's literall meaning, the one we think about when we hear the word universe. It's about a calling to it's beauty, and later, the star's call for us to join them across the universe, these are just beautifull images that add to the song’s mood of mysticism. It is a literal image of us elevating through meditation and joining the stars, our universe.
The lines that follows, continues with the idea of the lack of importance of our tribulations here on earth, and the our need to let them go. Once again our attempts of getting ahold of them are ridiculized by the image of the wind inside a letter box, another impossible attempt. The quick passing of our problems here on earth is emphasized, they are put in perspective in relation with that that is more important, finding peace and love. Our need to focus on more important matters.
""Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing Through my open views inciting and inviting me."" This relates once again with the lines about opening your mind and senses and letting the world in. ""Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns” is another metaphor of the way he feels the love of the world surrounding him. “It calls me on and on across the universe"", the same structure is repeated. This verses are another sublimation of the state of mind achieved through meditation.
Most of all is the call for us to be there, to reach for that eternal love, to becoming one with ourselves, our universe, our gods, with our love, with our joy, with our sorrow, with everything. Embracing not only the good but the bad in order to feel everything and love as we are loved inconditionally by the world. 
Love is once again (as its common in the amazing world of the Beatles songs), the main theme of this song, love for everything on earth. This idea is related to the desire of losing individuality, and the frustration this individuality carries (trying to hold on to things, and the immposibilty to do so), and the almost neccesary search for something that is superior to us, in order to be at peace with ourselves and with our universe.
I hope this is useful! It’s my way of seeing this incredible song.

			I think that's spot on. Very nice. I like how you bring out the themes of spectacular bliss in one's surrounding that can be felt in the fuller realization of love:

""Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing Through my open views inciting and inviting me."" This relates once again with the lines about opening your mind and senses and letting the world in. ""Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns” is another metaphor of the way he feels the love of the world surrounding him.

Also, you point out how important it is to realize that ""Nothing's going to change my world"" can be easily misinterpreted as arrogance or maybe even a false sense of invincibility.  

There are so many subtleties in these lyrics. I like how he describes ""pools of sorrow"" compared to ""waves of joy"", as if it indicate the stagnant, lingering, and accumulating  aspects of sorrow, versus the transient, fleeting, recurring nature of joyful experience.

However the ethereal mood in which Lennon writes is all there to see and hear, 'Jai Guru Deva. Om'. Basically he is in a chilled out mentality in which he feels everybody should participate in.
In an idealistic world it would be really beautiful, but we do not all have the wealth that he now found himself with. The wealth to leave his first wife and then to get involved into an ethereal relationship with the Yoko Ono. As much as that subsequent life enabled John to express himself much further than before in his life - and produce such beautiful poetry as within the lyrics for this song - it all began to prove to really be becoming a non realistic world for the average person.
Quite why a warped person chose to end his life is a mystery to me, as John would have ended frustrated by the fact that his ideals had never impacted on others - as beautiful as they might have been. But the average guy has mouths to feed and a mortgage/rent to pay, we can only dream. For me, it is headphones on in a darkened room listening to the track and dreaming of a future I would love to see!			






			I think that's spot on. Very nice. I like how you bring out the themes of spectacular bliss in one's surrounding that can be felt in the fuller realization of love:

""Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing Through my open views inciting and inviting me."" This relates once again with the lines about opening your mind and senses and letting the world in. ""Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns” is another metaphor of the way he feels the love of the world surrounding him.

Also, you point out how important it is to realize that ""Nothing's going to change my world"" can be easily misinterpreted as arrogance or maybe even a false sense of invincibility.  

There are so many subtleties in these lyrics. I like how he describes ""pools of sorrow"" compared to ""waves of joy"", as if it indicate the stagnant, lingering, and accumulating  aspects of sorrow, versus the transient, fleeting, recurring nature of joyful experience.     			

			Wow, i just read MindsTheatrre's post from below right after i posted this. Looks like he's elaborating on my pools/waves comment way before I ever posted it. That's strange to me. Next time I should read ahead, yes? But this whole forum is like looking at puzzle pieces isn't it?  			

			You are awesome!A very impressing explanation.

If you ever sit and close your eyes and exist in your own head you are just a small piece in everything that exists, like the universe.  When our mind is open its as big as the universe. Everything we’ve ever seen, said, imagined, light, all the people we’ve ever known, mixes of words and letters, our memories, they all exist in our minds, and they float around there undisturbed but in relation to each other, moving in harmony with each other and accepting and being thankful to this giant place they have to exist and be apart of because it is so magnificent.  When we go into our mind everything in that universe is accepting they want to share their happiness with everything else, it’s true happiness and comfort. Something people should be in search of in their lives in the real universe where people have become greedy of the objects that were so friendly and loving to us in our mind, when we treat parts of this universe badly things are not balanced, they are not in harmony. But when we find our own universe in our mind its so powerful it’s so inviting, it’s so attractive, and we love it just like every other piece of the universe does.  And the truth is no one can take the universe we have in our mind, no one.  No one can ruin or change our universe like they can change the world we live in, and nothing could hurt it anyway because there is so much love to a limitless extent that nothing could disturb the peace. The feeling when we are loved and we give love is one we should never forget in order to make the real world more peaceful.  To the people who complain about people who don’t know who wrote the song, remember the meaning of the song first, because in the end the lyrics of the song and the sound that comes from the song are what matters most, because we share these words and sounds with the universe.  We shouldn’t be obsessed with the idea of ownership.  Do you think the lyrics in this song want to be captured by a person? No, they want to be in harmony with the rest of the world.  With any song, with any music there is harmony between the words and the singer, the notes and the player.  When anyone sings this song it is just harmony it is the musician and the song harmonizing together giving each other love, thanks, and giving care for each other. As long as we give love to people in this world we are not wasting the time we have in this world.  It would be nice if one day things can be in harmony as they are when we fall into our minds, I do hope that eventually all people won’t be so greedy as to take away happiness from others, but to give it. Because I love being apart of my universe as John Lennon loves being apart of his universe, and as a lot of people and words and memories, and songs love being apart of their universe. So maybe someday we can share our minds with others and they share with us, to bring our own universes to the universe we live in.

It's a description of nascent attempts to meditate and become one with the universe.
Jai Guru Deva is just some thing to help the process and has no significant meaning.
This is how most new comers to meditation feel what it would be like.
Mind is trying to let go.. and the soul is trying to become.. but the Mind is vicious and it doesn't let go so easily.. But when's it does .. 'Nothing can change your world.' Not the World Not yourself, Your thoughts.

""Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me""

that is the single most important line in this song because it helps us to truly understand what Lennon was thinking, nothing. to have an open mind is to be completely open to the world around him and to experience life as it was meant to be experienced. to receive that ""limitless undying love"" one must be open to it and not be held back by the minds own ramblings. 

""Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe""

his thoughts are there and he is aware of them, but he pays them no mind. he locks them away and puts them inside a box. he knows that all negativity is an illusion created by the mind. the only real in his life was what he could actually experience and this song is about how wonderful it is when you stop letting your thoughts rule you.

"

Several of Twenty One Pilots' songs have lyrics that COULD be interpreted as being Christian in nature, but this one is pretty obvious. It's a prayer. He's talking to God, the Father, at the end of another day. And the water is the ""living water"" of Christ. There's a lot of clever imagery in this song. For those of us Christians who are struggling to stay in relationship with Christ, it's very relatable.

@Moonbeam86 















This song is a Christian Song. The water stands for God, The Holy Spirit, and Jesus. The sand is the world, or in greek ""Cosmos"". Basically he has Jesus an wants to walk with him and do his work but he trying to be in the world as well. Matthew 6:24 proves this. He needs his healing.

			and* he is* His* my apologies.			

I know people think this song is all Christian meaning, but I am pretty much an Atheist. This does not mean that the true meaning is wrong, I agree, it's about Jesus or whatever, and that's awesome, but my personal interpretation reminds me of a son and father who are distant and the son writes this song to his dad explaining how they havent been talking and that he misses him and needs him and how he is struggling in life, and he needs his father's wisdom and support that he has little of, which reminds me of the part where the singer says ""I hold the water in the palm of my hand"" referring to his memories, wisdom, and support from his father. When the verse continues and the water is lost, i believe it means that his relationship with his father is basically ruined and that the son is alone with no water, which can represent a necessity of life, especially in the desert. And a son needs his father, so the water and the desert have a lot of meaning to me.

@Shane73607 this is very true. However as I read this all I think of is our heavenly Father. Which is what we need. The heavenly Father's love. He has run go the world and been drained... He is in need of water (life/The Father). And this is what we are all in need of. It just can be difficult due to our sin nature and chasing wordly desires. But we cannot have both which is where we all struggle with the pull between the world and the living water which would be the love of our heavenly Father Jesus Christ. Thank you for you post. It made me happy whether you meant to write about Christ or not... I felt the love of Christ through your writing and I am able to relate much to this. I struggle between the world and the true love of Christ which I crave so much. Two cravings... (World and love) but sometimes I struggle with looking for that love in the world rather than in the one who truly loves and knows my heart... The alpha and omega... Our heavenly father. Thank you.

@Shane73607 tbf that's a similar relationship​ to a Christian and their holy father, who is never physically there. I've lost my dad seven years ago, so I see that side of the meaning, but I'm also Christian so I also relate with  the religious interpretation

I value both interpretations. My relationship with my earthly father has been complicated to say the least. Over the years he's kind of disappeared every now and again. Only to show back up just to push me away again somehow. Whether it's basically  disowning me because I'm not happy about some club he's joined or the worst insult he can come up with is my gender which somehow makes me horrible, or  when he was physically abusive. It ticks me off that it's never been a normal life. 
I value the Christian interpretation because I've hit rock bottom multiple times and my faith in God is the only thing that's gotten me through. 
 This song has a double meaning for me.

Tyler is writing about how he has been away from God for a long time at the beginning of the song. He hasn't talked to him for quite some time and he feels that without God he is missing some of the water of life.
The desert of his mind is a reflection of being lost without God in sin, and that is all in his head. The sin comes from him saying that he ""hasn't been the best"". 
The remainder of the song is about Tyler trying to find just a drop of water, which is him trying to get back to God but he isn't reaching him.
The best way to explain the Christian view of this song occurs when he says ""You hear me screaming/Father/And I'm lying here just crying/So wash me with your water"". 
Simply a brilliant song, and great representation of finding God.

Hello
We haven't talked in quite some time
I know
I haven't been the best
Of sons

no quite sure about this first part.

Hello
I've been traveling in
The desert of my mind
And I
Haven't found a drop
Of life
I haven't found a drop
Of you
I haven't found a drop
Of water

he might be talking about how hes trying to search through his mind to find some meaning of himself, and trying to find some happy thoughts abut himself or someone he loves (a drop of you)

I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water
In the palm of my hand
Cause it's all that I have
It's all that I need and

he might be talking about im running through life, and getting stuck in problem desperately trying to keep the water (the things that matter to him) from spilling.

The waves of the water
Mean nothing to me
But I try my best
And all that I can to
Hold tightly onto
What's left in my hand
But no matter how
How tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down
And the water will drain

he might be talking about how as hard as he tries, he can never keep the water (the things that matter to him) safe, but he cant because the sand (problems in his life) is draging him down and he cant stop the water from draining so hes slowly losing everything.

I'm just being dramatic
In fact,
I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen
Who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and fourth
Mindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again
See you tomorrow
But it's the end of today
End of my ways

he might be talking about how hes just over reacting and hes just overthinking it all the time and hes just ""at it again"" - saying he writes about this stuff all the time and hes getting sick of himself doing that.

As a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy
Suicidal head case

he might be talking about how hes in denial about his whatever he is talking about and every time he tries to talk about whatever it, people just call him a ""crazy suicidal head case""

But you specialize in dying
You hear me screaming
Father
And I'm lying here just crying
So wash me with your water

again, not sure about this, there might be a religious meaning behind this,

im not saying this is the actual meaning, these are just my thoughts

@sstressedout where i say - ""he might be talking about how hes in denial about his whatever he is talking about""

@sstressedout where i say - ""he might be talking about how hes in denial about his whatever he is talking about""

""Hello
We haven't talked in quite some time
I know
I haven't been the best
Of sons""

He is speaking to God, referring to himself as his son (as we are all God's children according to Christian belief). By saying he isn't the best of sons, he is saying that he hasn't been a good Christian and has had a strained relationship with God. It has been a while since he's prayed. 

""Hello
I've been traveling in
The desert of my mind
And I
Haven't found a drop
Of life
I haven't found a drop
Of you
I haven't found a drop
I haven't found a drop
Of water""

I believe that in this verse, he is stating that his belief in God has been weakening, and that a relationship with God is virtually nonexistent since when he searches his mind he cannot seem to locate any faith. 

""I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water
In the palm of my hand
Cause it's all that I have
And it's all that I need and
The waves of the water
Mean nothing to me
But I try my best
And all that I can to
Hold tightly onto
What's left in my hand
But no matter how
How tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down
And the water will drain""

""Water"" is holy, it's representing his faith here. The sand represents the world. He is trying to hold on to his faith and he walks through the world and all his struggles. However, no matter how much he tries to hold on to his faith, the world will begin to ""drain"" it out of him until he has no faith left. 

""I'm just being dramatic
In fact,
I'm only at it again
As an addict with a pen
Who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth
Mindless, spineless, and pretend
Of course I'll be here again
See you tomorrow

End of my ways
As a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy
Suicidal head case
But you specialize in dying
You hear me screaming
Father
And I'm lying here just crying
So wash me with your water""

He is saying that he is overreacting and that he just writes what he's thinking on the spot. The wind seems to represent the troubles in his life and he's trying to overcome them. He is stating that he will be praying again tomorrow, but that today he's going to to stop denying that he needs God. It appears that no one else is helping him and that he just been labeled ""crazy"" and ""suicidal"" by others. He is asking God to help him, he needs God in his life as he is struggling and asking to wash him with his water, which means saving him.

As a teenager sometimes life can suck right? But Jesus I feel has reached out to me when I was younger but I have been drifting with all these new urban theories and myths I've been falling away from God but after hearing this song it made me really think about my faith and it really shows how much God can change a person like Tyler in this song because he is Christian and I feel the Same is happening to me but slowly and i listen to this song to help me remind myself of what I should focus on

"
41,Aenema.json,"
I'm quite surprised on how little some people know about Tool. The CD this song comes from was entirely dedicated to the late great Bill Hicks (R.I.P.), and some of the lyrics, this song specifically, are actually plays off rants that Bill Hicks had. Maynard (and Tool) and Bill Hicks were close friends. Bill Hicks had mentioned numerous times about how much he hates L.A. and just wants to flush the whole thing down, so people better start learning to swim or they will drowned in their own filth. And the ""see you down in Arizona Bay"" part, Bill Hicks had also said that too. So all in all, this song is pretty straight forward if you know of the legendary Bill Hicks.

@Chrismbax 















I think this song follows a similar theme to that of many Tool songs - enlightenment. It seems it can be taken at face value and that the 'narrator' is just sick of everything that is wrong with L.A. Taken to a deeper level of meaning, however, and I think the song is about hope for better rather than worse. Here is what the song translates to, in my opinion of course;

Most of the song is written from a negative perspective and in such a way that it really resonates with the disillusionment in many people. I think many people would derive a sick pleasure from watching the world collapse and to feel that their own misery is near an end, but i think the narrator sums it up perfectly when he says 'Don't just call me pessimist, try and read between the lines. I can't imagine why you wouldn't welcome any change, my friend.' To me this part implies that, although the narrator is speaking from a negative point of view, the desire is a positive one. 

As with many of Tool's songs, Keenan suggests that by simply living in the here and now and by accepting each moment as the only thing that truly exists, one can be freed from the bonds of human existence and from a position in time (Parabola, perhaps?)in order to feel truly connected with the 'oneness' of consciousness. For most people, enlightenment is an esoteric concept rather than a freedom achievable with anyone who so strongly desires it. For those who do become enlightened, a large proportion had to suffer greatly in order for the transmutation to commence. Some became enlightened due to the death of a loved one, or through severe illness. In my case, I experienced a sudden flash of enlightened awareness after years of suffering from severe depression and anxiety. I am still practicing in order to get to that peaceful place again.

To me, the song seems to imply that the narrator hopes for a cataclysmic event to wake up those whose eyes are closed to the true and beautiful nature of existence.

Cheers.

The 'learn to swim' part is a message for all Californians because maynards praying for it to sink into the ocean...if you notice in the in-lay of Tool's cd the 3-d picture, if you move it...only California dissappears.

""fret for your pilot"" hes talking about a television pilot..etc

this song is just one big fuck you to Los Angeles, the entertainment industry, and to all the narcissistic people in california.

Hey everyone!
I just gotta say, by lookin past the surface of this song, or at least by tryin too, I get a lot more out of it. It goes past bein angry at how fake and superficial people and LA are. The word AEenma is a mixture of the word Enema, which is clearing of the bowels with fluid, and the word Anima, which is, in Jungian theory, the true inner subconscious self. It seems to me that this song is about clearing away those attachments to stupid useless shit that we don't need, and getting back to nature. He makes multiple references to mom, which is probably Mother Nature. Its about getting back to our true inner selves, uncovering what's hidden in our subconcious, and clearing away all of the shit, and learning how to swim. LEARN TO SWIM,
The Full Effect

			i agree the more we advance as a race the less we stop and think about nature and how things used to be when everyone wasnt so corrupt you did what you had to do to stay alive but now everything is just so much more complicated if you can clean your self you will be back to childhood when you know nothing but what is in front of your eyes

			Ok... My friends and I have done Extensive research and thought about this song. We have come to the conclusion that this song is tool's take on the preachings/ramblings of a man that goes by the name of H.P. Lovecraft. Look into his writings/stories/philosophes, you will find some very striking similarities between his Ideals and the lyrics of this song.

Enjoy enlightenment!

			I like the idea about mom being ""Mother Nature"" but I think it may just be Maynard's reflection on what society has become. It goes back to the whole ""who would win in a fight: an astronaut or a caveman?"" thing. Many Americans often become isolated from the real world by their riches and end up in a kind of bubble shielding them from the real world's problems. As a result, they start to care less about serious problems and care much more about insignificant, childish things, i.e. celebrities and fashion and what's cool. We begin to forget about the real problems (""Fuck your short memory""). By saying that ""Mom's coming around to put it back the way it ought to be"", he is calling us all children who can't deal with our own problems and who need a true adult to solve them for us.

"
45,Ain't No Stopping Us Now.json,nil
46,Air Catcher.json,"
Tyler wrote this song about a person (a girl most likely) that had the ability to knock the wind out of him or steal his air. He created the term 'air catcher' to describe one who steals the air out of his lungs because he finds that person to be engaging, shocking, and awe-inspiring. Obviously, this person (let's pretend this person is a girl Tyler is in love with) has a certain paralyzing effect on our beloved lyricist, Mr. Joseph. However, he is wary of love and its tempting ways. The chorus ""I won't fall in love with following"" makes use of the gerund ""falling"". In this case ""falling"" refers to 'falling in love'. Tyler declares he won't fall in love with falling in love, meaning he won't fall in love with someone just because he wants to be with someone or because he seeks a soulmate, but he desires a real connection in which a girl really amazes him and is worthy of his love besides the fact that she loves him back; she amazes on her own. Furthermore, the opening lines ""I don't fall slow like I used to; I fall straight down"" imply that Tyler used to take things slow, but his injured soul quickly attaches to the first person that shows him kindness and love. Lastly, the lines ""I'm here to give you words as tools that can destroy my heart"" mean he will tell this girl that he loves her, making him vulnerable, because everyone knows love hurts and attachment promises some degree of suffering.

i think of the air catcher as his way to save himself from the darkness. its a good thing. and he needs it to get better. but the person who stole his air catcher has come into his life. this might not even be romantic. maybe just a toxic friend. but this person has been influencing tyler and taking his air catcher and his safety. but as his air catcher keeps disappearing he becomes very conflicted whether he should fight this or not. he shouldnt fall in love with being sad but hes rethinking protecting himself. this song just gives me something to relate to when i feel i have a person in my life who is stealing my air catcher

I think it's a song about falling in love with someone. The term ""take your breath away"" kind of strikes me as something an ""air catcher"" would prevent. Thus, the narrator is in love, whoever they think of took their breath away, as well as the air catcher that they can't use to bring it back.

@OdeToHurley 















Air Catcher was the first song from this album to really catch my attention and I listened to it nonstop for a few months. I absolutely love this song and this is what it means to me.

I fall straight down
You've stolen my air catcher
That kept me safe and sound
My parachutes will get me
Safely to ground
But now the cord's not working
And I see you staring me down>
I've always thought of ""you"" as being someone or something that's negatively affecting his life. Such as a toxic friend, illness, or just bad situations. I like to think of ""you"" as depression or anxiety, but it's totally open to whatever you're personally dealing with. The parachute is something that's been helping him in his life, and ""you"" breaks the parachute, and suddenly he's free falling.

The moon in a pretty contest
And the moon just happened to be
The very first thing that I missed
I was doing fine on my own
And there wasn't much I lacked
But you've stolen my air catcher
And I don't know if I want it back>
The problem is beautiful, like how depression and things like it can be really poetic and make life more interesting. He was doing alright before the problem showed up. When it did come, it messed up his life, but made it more interesting and he's not sure he wants to be free of this problem.

Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes>
The chorus is about how he's not going to let ""you"" control his life. People tend to own their problems in a way, and they don't want to let them go. In other words, there's a part of them that's ""in love with falling."" It's the same with friends whom you like but are bad for you. He's trying not to become attached to this problem. He doesn't want to give it/them the information or control that will destroy him. 

What you want to hear
So I'll write my fears
And I don't believe
In talking just to breathe
And falling selfishly>
The bridge is a little less straightforward. The first part seems to be talking more about his resistance to give the problem authority, and the second about how keeping this problem around (especially long enough for it to become bad enough that he dies or something) is selfish. 

Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes
But now I'm here
To give you words
As tools that can destroy
My heart>
The last chorus is my favorite part because it's not a victory. It starts out the same as before, he's trying to resist, but despite that, he still gives up and gives the problem what it needs to destroy him.
Anyway, that's just how I see it. Thanks for reading my really long comment; I hope you got something out of it.

@CoralCorral21 that is amazing, and ver close to what i was guessing. “You” seems like Blurryface..			

An air catcher is just another term for the parachute he mentions.  He's used to being in control of his feelings when he is in a relationship, which means that he allows his love to evolve on his own terms and controls it with the ""cord"" he mentions.  He ""parachutes"" into love at his own pace.  But he has lost control of his air catcher with this woman; he is falling in love with her.  However, he is uncomfortable with giving her the tools to destroy his heart (saying that he loves her which opens him up to this pain).  By the end he decides to say he loves her and give in to his love for her even though he knows it will open him up to being hurt by her.

@Telperion77 















I think he's using a parachute as a metaphor. Parachutes catch air underneath them, that's how they keep people in the air (where they want to be) and safe. ""My parachute will get me safely to ground. But now my cord's not working and I see you staring me down"" almost sounds like he's referring to Blurryface, like someone wants him dead. ""Who is Blurryface and why does he want me dead"" seems like it could fit the song.

@kami114118 















I think this one is about the fear of ""falling"", or falling in love. The air catcher basically is just a parachute and that's metaphorically how he always caught himself before he could fall too hard for someone. However, this person has now completely knocked him out and although he's afraid of falling in love, he doesn't want it to stop (""you've stolen my air catcher, and I don't know if I want it back""). He knows that if he loves this person he opens himself up to vunerability and is allowing the possibility of getting hurt (""tools to destroy my heart"").

Lambert explained this acoustic country swing number, which was inspired by a 1980 Merle Haggard song: ""I've been obsessed with Airstreams for a while now. I don't really know why. Don't have one, don't need one. But I want one! I always do 'The Way I Am' by Merle in my show, if I have an encore, just because I love that song, and it's not right not to play a Merle song on stage. I was telling Blake (Shelton) one day, 'There's a song missing that I haven't written yet.' He said, 'Why don't you go write ""The Way I Am"" for you?' And I did. That song is definitely, what if I wasn't doing this? What if I could just fly away out of my body for a day?""

I, too, think that this is a great song, the best Christmas-themed pop song since ""Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home)"" by Darlene Love. This song expresses ideas that are universal no matter the time of year. The things that make us happiest in life are things we can't buy. Also, the things we want the most are often things we don't (or can't) have. Things that are seemingly out of our reach have an ability to enthrall our imagination and tug at our innermost emotions. I could go on, but I think Carey's song puts it so much better than I ever could.

			His songs were so simple and everyone could relate to them. And he had the ability to take the songs of others (w/o worry of copyright infringement:) that were not well-received and turn them into major hits. I like the line you chose. Love is always a little scary; we have to relingish our egos and allow our guard down...and pray we're still accepted. Lots of warts on us all. Elvis was such a cool dude and his master (the Colonel) knew how to make him and keep him famous.

I believe that this song is about two people who broke up awhile ago for reasons they now find ridiculous or can't remember.  Since they broke up, they've been trying to find something or someone new in their life to make them happy but nothing works.  They still have the same feelings for each other and they try to suppress the fact that they still love the other person but they can't... they can only hide it from other people, but in all honesty they constantly think of each other and want them back because they keep thinking about the love they shared (and didn't yet extinguish).

I'm going through this right now.  I thought that I was insane for still liking my ex.  But last night he told me that he still crazy about me and has strong intense feelings for me that he can't hold in anymore.  I was so relieved, because we broke up three months ago and I haven't gone a day without thinking about him, I check his facebook page, relate every song to him and I, save all of our conversations online... and reread them over and over, and reminisce our past.  We're both relieved now that we know we still love each other ""after all this time"".

This song really captures the tragedy of the ""would be love"" that I'm sure we've all experienced. They both loved each other but never said the words when it would have mattered.

Life will always be haunted with those ""what ifs"" if you don't tell that someone how you feel.

in a time when the bands like the Rolling Stones were writing songs like Street Fighting Man and Paint it Black which were anti-vietnam songs (dont get me wrong, i think those songs are great), those songs merely stated the problem.  The Beatles wrote this song which states the solution, all you need is love.  This is just one reason why they are the greatest band ever.

people think they're powerful but they have limits. you cant do anything special. you cant do anything impossible. You are limited by reality. whats special about winning a gold medal? its not like you did the impossible you just did what was possible. figure out a science formula its know great achevment. if it wasnt possible to figure it out you never would have.

achevments are nothing all you need is to enjoy life and love. being happy is all that matters.

@eiwets You got it right (in my opinion).  This is exactly how I've come to interpret the song, about 50 years after first hearing it.  For years I figured that the lyrics were a sloppy attempt to say ""You can do anything if you have Love.""  I slowly realized that this wasn't Lennon's style.  He was straightforward:  saying exactly what he meant.  When you think about exactly what he was saying, it seems to be exactly what you are saying:  You can't achieve the impossible.  We are all limited...but, not to worry, we can be OK if we remember to love ourselves and all around us.

But then again, just making it 7/4 would let there be a lot less time signature changes, so maybe you're right :)

I love this song... but it still sounds very weird to me to hear the French National Anthem at the beginning... because it’s not about love at all! It’s about bloody flags, people being slaughtered... about going to war, or rather to fight for the Revolution so it’s rather inappropriate when you really think about it. 
But still, great song.

"

This song, more than anything, is a cry for help. The person feels haunted by the love he never should have let go, desperately trying to find a way to free himself from this emotional torment. But no matter what he does, where he goes, or who he dates, he's always going to love that one person, never able to truly and fully let go of what they once had. 

In the first chorus he begs for redemption, asking ""Shouldn't there be some small exemption, if he does all that it takes to admit to his mistakes, till the truth batters and breaks his world apart."" He has admitted to his wrong doings, understanding the impact the truth can have on a person's life, and he is, simply, begging (to a higher power) to relieve him of this pain---he has done his time so to speak.

Time doesn't heal everything.

It could also mean a love so great that the person is looking for the dead loved one and he can't get over the loss of him or her. When in the song it says ""Small Exemption"" and ""Forgiveness"" the person may be putting the blame on him for the death of the loved one. And is always looking for an answer and a way to get the loved one back somehow and in the beginning of the song it says ""Mystery"" because there is no solution to finding that person because of his or her passing. And when it says ""Convinced I've found the one I'm dreamin' of  And it's always gonna be u that I love"" could mean he had a dream of the dead loved one being convinced he had found the person but when he woke up realized it was only a dream and simply stated you will always be the one I love.

This song obviously is about the hardships of the modern American farmer.

""The diesels worth the price of gold 
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold 
But he's still holdin' on""

 It is becoming very hard to make a living with the high cost of equipment and low price of crops but still they sweat and toil because its their way of life and they know no different. These people really are owed a debt by everyone. Without them, we wouldn't have our market fresh food at the grocery, the canned corn or even soybean oil. we would be a culture without food. And even though it is one of the toughest jobs in the world they stick with it. God bless....

“He just takes the tractor another round, And pulls the plow across the ground” this line describes a small town farmer who does back breaking work day in and day out to put bread on the table. He continues this hard work because he knows it’s all worth it in the end. I’m the kind of person that will work as hard as I need to in order to achieve a goal. So I can completely understand why he is doing this. 

“And sends up another prayer, He says Lord I never complain, I never ask why, please don’t let my dreams run dry, underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky.” Personally I can relate the most to this line. All he wants is to support his family and he finds the greatest joy when he is able to do that. He loves his family more than anything so when he is able to bring food to the table, that’s enough for him. Back to how I can relate. I ride horses, which probably makes you all think “money”. I’m not going to lie my parents have to work really hard in order for me to be able to ride and have a horse. When I get older, then I will have to work extremely hard to be able to ride and have a horse. But, like the farmer just wanting to support his family, I just want to be able to ride. I don’t care about a flashy life, instead, I’m the happiest person in the world when I’m on a horse, or even near one.

A Soldier must serve for twnety years to get retirment.  Its twenty years in debt to the government, officialy Soldiers are u.s property, and its a hard twenty.

The National Guard is recognized as the oldest branch of the military which was made up of farmers.

I know what this song means, but in my opinion, its different. To be honest, I've been reading ""The Capture"" by Kathryn Lasky, and this song reminds me a bit of one of the characters.
Keep in mind this is my interpretation, not the real meaning.

Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by?

To me, this means someone is living in such horrible conditions that they're slowly going mad, or becoming emotionless or something. 

Twenty years in debt
Twenty years in the government
Twenty years can never get me by

Once again, I believe this means that someone is imprisoned. They gave into working for horrible people so they could protect their family. The person knew that it was for the best despite how hard it would be to work, and escaping was unrealistic.

Then I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you

No matter how much time passes, they still believe that they are doing the right thing. Despite the protests of their loved ones, the person didn't wish for them to be hurt.

Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

Every single day is hell, and the person is slowly losing their head. They have to watch people, emotionless with defects, slaving away at unnecessary work. Yet every single day, the person seems to grow a bit stronger.

From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise

Where the person works, they see many people doing different jobs, such as caring for babies, and a type of mining for a diamond-like thing. No matter how different they are, they're all the same slaves.

1-7-7-6
The names upon the list

In the book, the enslaved characters are always renamed with numbers, so this is very meaningful.

For all the ones that gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free

Eventually, the person finds two children that resisted the hypnotism. He tells them that he can teach them to escape by flying. When they are flying away, he's dying, proud that he helped them.

""Twenty years in debt

It takes 20 years of serving in the army to earn retirement. Therefore, they were in 20 tears of debt in the government. 

""Then I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you""

Feelings of missing a loved one while serving. You're feeling them next to you even when they're not.

""Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry

Family, loved ones, ect. are encouragement to push though and tough it out.

""From farmers in the fields""

I think ID is referring to early army soldiers because the following statements are about previous milestones for the US:

""To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise""

The twin towers on 9- 11 ;~;

""1-7-7-6, The names upon the list""

1776 was the year we declared independence and the names upon the list are all the men who signed the document. 

""For all the ones that gave until they died""

The list was not in vain, for all the ones who fought for our independence had died, but gave for our country. 

I don't fully understand the :

""Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free""

But I think it means that you can't give half effort for something you committed to (?) I dunno..

"
70,Amsterdam.json,"
I interpret this song a little differently than most (I would think). It's about a man that really tried to love a woman - who loved him - but he just didn't feel that ""spark""/connection that he was holding out for. 

 In the first two verses, he is apologizing to the those closest to him in his life - who worry about him and are trying to ""ground"" him. In the first, his mother. He tells her everything is fine, but in reality it's not. And filled with these struggling emotions, he begins to let his mind wander. Whether he literally goes to Amsterdam is unknown - however one could interrupt that he is referring to drug use (a concept often associated with Amsterdam). 

 In the second verse, his brother confronts him. It's almost inferred that either 1) his brother has been through the same situation; or 2) his brother is troubled by the fact that he can't help the narrator; or 3) it dawns upon his brother, that he is in the same situation. I believe it is the third; which leads to the third verse. 

 He's telling his brother: that a time will come, when he's loved by someone, who loves him equally - and that they both make each other happy. 

 In the fourth verse, he finally addresses the reason behind all this depression and madness: his lover. He addresses her as ""lover"", so we can infer that she does love him, and this is not a situation where he loves a woman that can't reciprocate. I interpret the beautiful poetry in these lines to reflect the notion that he's always felt distant to her. He says that he's tried, but instantly says that he also lies. 

""Kinda thought I was a mystery and then I thought I wasn't meant to be"" to me means, ""I thought I was too complicated for someone, and then I thought that maybe I was never meant to fall in love."" His ""lovers"" response to this, was to say ""Congratulations, you were all alone"" I infer this line to mean that her reply wasn't what he sought. She was too logical to love, she told him that the only reason he felt that way, was because he was alone before. ""Congratulations"" is almost said in a sarcastic tone. What he wanted, was for her to show him that he was wrong, to make him happy - but she couldn't. 

""Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me... I've tried
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me... I've tried""

He's telling her: ""I'm sorry, but the time for you to love someone, that will make you happy, will come - but it's not me. It's a hard thing to do - wait for love - and I know, because I've been trying this whole time."" 


""But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way""

He's attempting to rid her mind of any false hope. He rather find a true sense of happiness and love, than pretend that there is such between them. 


""Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me... I've tried
But I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I keep coming up short""

To me, these last lines aren't to his lover. But to himself. He's tried waiting for love - more than once - and he's waiting to feel that sense of ""being in love""/that magical feeling that's comforting, weird, warm and cold at the same time. He's tried of waiting, and mentally it's begun to take a toll on him. His ""inner walls""/his mind, is getting to a dangerous point of no return - where it will finally collapse on him. 

It could also mean that he hasn't ended the relationship with his ""lover"" yet. And that he's still trying to give her a chance, but he doesn't know if he can do it for much longer. 

 That's my uneducated two sense.

@EiliaYazdanian Thank you for this interpretation. I've been listening to this song for a while but I never actually listened to the lyrics before (not a native speaker). Reading your comment I felt extremely sad because it describes exactly the way I feel about my girlfriend these days. Weird I looked it up at this precise moment.

I think the meaning in this song ultimately lies in the chorus:
""Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
But I keep coming up short""
Whatever time that may be I think depends on each individual person's life, but eventually, everyone has their time!
It is hard to believe, and the artist connects with us in the second line of the chorus by saying he has tried, and this makes me think of all the times I have had to be patient for something, and how hard it has been, and a few of those occasions I too came up short. I think the key message here though, is if we can stay patient, our time will come :)

@RamuneDrink 















this song seems to be about someone letting someone else down.
""i'm sorry mother, i'm sorry i let you down''
its about when you let someone down, you wish you had done something different, you wish you treated them different. and they go on to a different place but you stay in the same place.

""i take the west train, just by the side of Amsterdam.""
their taking different roads to each other.

""your time will come, if you wait for it.""
your time will come when you see what you've done; what you should have done instead. the mistake you've made.

no hate please ;)

@exzeldian 















The ""I'm sorry I let/bring you down"" lyrics seem to imply that the narrator feels inadequate or worthless. Perhaps I'm overanalyzing here, the mentions of ""my left brain"" (considered the more logical brain half) and ""the tin man"" (who, in the wizard of Oz, didn't have a heart) seem to reference a logical, emotionless outlook - perhaps the narrator thought he would be better off remaining logical rather than focusing on his feelings of low-self esteem. In the chorus - ""your time will come if you wait for it... it's hard, believe me, I've tried"" - he reveals that even someone with a low sense of self-worth like him will eventually have a time when their life gets better, even if it's hard to wait for that time.

@UWSGuy2 















I'm a person who have a dream and is pursuing it, and this song really struck a cord on me. I can relate to a lot of it, so it was very understandable to me. (just how I understood it)

I really think that this song is about someone who is following his heart.
Someone who have to sacrifice people he loves, leaving them for his dreams but keeps failing and feeling like he is disappointing everyone he loves. 
He is having trouble with self worth and feeling like a failure.

""I'm sorry, mother I'm sorry, I let you down""
-He thinks he is disappointing people who he cares about and people who knows he is out there to follow his dreams.

""Well, these days I'm fine - No these days I tend to lie""
-He is staying strong for them, he wants to let them know he is doing just fine on his pursuit, but he is not.

""I'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin man""

-He is on a journey. Tin man is a fictional character searching for where his heart is. ""Just by the side of the Tin man"" means he is going on the same journey as Tin man did and go where his heart is.

""I'm sorry, brother I'm sorry, I let cha down
Well, these days you're fine, no these days you tend to lie
You'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin man""

-""Brother"" might be literal or referring to people who are going through the same. His brother might've also gone on the same journey, leaving they're ""mother"" or people they care about to follow his dreams.

""Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
But I keep coming up short""

-He is referring to himself and to the others who tried. (before the chorus he mentioned his brother) He have gone through the same and keeps on failing.

""I'm sorry, lover you're sorry; I bring you down"" 
-His lover is someone who he had to sacrifice for his dreams.

""Well, these days I try and these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought I was a mystery and then I thought I wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically, ""Congratulations you were all alone""

-It seems that his heart was truly for his dreams, he wasn't really able to do her his best because he is focused on something else.
He thought it might be something special but he realized that what he really is meant for is not her. 
Apparently, the lover FANTASTICALLY said ""Congratulations you are all alone"" saying to him that he can finally go for his true passion and she would not be a burden anymore because he thought that he was hurting her. 
He knows she is not his true love.

""But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way""

-There is just now way they can be together. It's painful but he does not regret that he would have to be far away from them, probably just to fail. He just can't give up on his dreams. He is willing to give it all up.

""But I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I keep coming up short""

-He really tried his best but this line just shows that the meaning is really about someone who keeps on trying, pursuing their dreams but keeps on failing. 
Even though they have to sacrifice so much, people they care about and love.

If you have a dream and full on pursuing it too, you can probably relate to this. 
It gets you on your knees, make you be willing to give up everything for it.

@cloudydaydream 















I think of the Holocaust. Let me break it down for you:

I'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin man 
-and-
You'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin man

Amsterdam was the capitol of the Netherlands, and the Netherlands were (obviously) invaded by Hitler and the Nazis. People were sent off on trains (relations to 'West train') to concentration camps.

NEXT

You said yourself fantastically, ""Congratulations you were all alone""

People were sent of to camps and they were left completely alone, separated from families and friends. This was common during those times.

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
But I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I keep coming up short

Jews and other people were held in the camps, dying and waiting to be rescued by the other countries. 'These walls they're crashing down' could be people on the brink of insanity, death, or it could possibly be the burning of camps.

Really, if you think about it, it kind of fits. Also, I believe ""Radioactive"" follows along this theme (really it's a bit obvious there).

Songs have hidden meanings, and really when it sounds like something happy it can be something completely different. This is just my take on it and I'd really like some feedback, and I'm also confident that I am correct.

In a similar analagy 'RadioActive' I think is more about the tempters than the temptees.

			A problem I have with this theory, although it is small, is that because the Netherlands are west of Germany, all the trains will have been heading east, so the West train doesn't really make sense in the holocaust analogy.

To be blunt, I think its a song about depression and suicide. 

DEPRESSION
He's repeatedly apologizing to the people he mentions

Saying he's 'let them down' and when he mentions his lover he says he 'brings them down'

'But rain won't fall for the both of us, the sun won't shine on the both of us' he's basically saying that only one will make it through the depression and that it wouldn't be him, but that he 'wouldn't have it any other way'

'These days I'm fine, well these days I tend to lie' he's not fine, he's putting on a brave face, although in the brother verse the brother has noticed that he isn't OK

now, this is all fine and good for the depression aspect, but depression doesn't make a suicide.

SUICIDE
'Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
But I keep coming up short'

your time is referring to death... death will come if you wait for it, but it's hard to wit for it, he's tried, but he came out short. and he keeps coming out short, referring to the fact that he's failed in some way to wait for his time, to wait for death.

I thought I wasn't meant to be, he thought he wasn't meant to be alive, if he was talking about a relationship he would have said WE weren't meant to be, but he said I wasn't meant to be.

Once again, apologizing and letting people down

'But I won't wait much longer cause these walls they're crashing down', the depression has become to much

I think he might have finally succeeded in his suicide, because the last words are that he came up short, the song is like his suicide note.

@chewy13 















Most Imagine Dragon songs have multiple meanings and this is one of them.
this could either be a song about moving on with your life, leaving your past behind and becoming a better person
OR
i've been listening to this song for a while now and just recently came up with a different interpretation, a more serious one, dealing with suicide. 
""I'm sorry Mother
I'm sorry I let you down""
is the persons note
""These days I'm fine
No these days I tend to lie""
is the person pretending to be ok while secretly being depressed, etc
""I'll take the west train
just by the side of Amsterdam""
is the person saying they're going to kill themselves
""Just by my left brain
just by the side of the tin man""
?? not sure, possibly talking about a gun being used in the suicide

the same ideas are repeated in the second verse, and first half the third

""Kinda thought it was a mystery
then i thought it was a meant to be""
describing the relationship with their partner
""you say yourself fantastically
'congratulations you were all alone'""
possibly the partner was going through the same things as them, or they recently broke up

""But the rain wont fall for the both of us
the sun wont shine for the both of us
believe me when i say
that i wouldn't have it any other way""
they are/have sacrificed their happiness for this person and would rather die than see that person be sad

""your time will come 
if you wait for it""
talking about being their time to die, they're probably happy for it

""it's hard believe me i've tried""
they tried living life but it was just too hard

""and i keep coming up short""
?? not quite sure, possibly they've attempted before and it never worked

this whole song is kind of a note to probably a lover who's struggling with the same demons before that person kills them self. Really sad, i know, but just my opinion. 
it's an amazing song and i absolutely love it

Steve just broke up with his girlfriend, (well she dumped him).  Extremely depressed and angry, (perhaps drunk or high) he's on a killing rampage shooting bullets of out his gun to anyone around him on his way to his ex-girlfriend to shoot her.

is there really another way to explain it?

@piant 















i found this on faqs.org/lyrics/…


Another One Bites The Dust by Queen was released in 1980 and reached number 1 in the US charts and number 7 in the UK charts.

The lyrics to this song were inspired after the writer saw a documentary on the St. Valentines day Massacre.

If you don't know that it is quite hard to understand what the lyrics are about.

They describe a man walking silently down a street with his hat covering his face carrying a machine gun.

The words of the song are building up an atmosphere describing what is about to happen, is there going to be some kind if fight and if so who with, who will he start shooting?

The song then takes a twist when he starts singing about someone who has wronged him, a lover perhaps, who left him with nothing and with nowhere to live.

The song ends with bullets being fired and another one biting the dust so you can only imagine that he has gone looking for an ex lover and he has killed them for the way they treated him.

There is some controversy over this song because it is claimed that if it is played backwards you can hear the words 'Decide to smoke marijuana' several times quite clearly.

			I concur on that. For example, a few paranoid, gullible people thought in the '70s that KISS records were evil and contains backwards messages about Satan. I own a KISS record, played it backwards, and heard nothing audible. Myth dispelled.
Also, if you got the stones and hard evidence of the whole marijuana reference, I'd love to hear it (no backmasking, no broken links, no nothing. Just an audible version of it that any normal person can hear.) Go on, I DARE you. And...GO.

That is all.

@Blackadder The idea that Freddy Mercury would backmask that message in 1980 was always ridiculous.

The original backmasking controversy was so played out by then that even ELO's increasingly silly joke messages had stopped; nobody was doing it anymore unless they had something really clever. (Of course people started again after the Satanic metal panic brought back the silly controversy, but that was still a few years in the future, and I don't think Freddy had a TARDIS.)

Plus, if Freddy wanted to be subversive or provocative, it'd be as bombastic and over the top as everything he wrote, not a line as prosaic and clumsy as ""Decide to smoke marijuana"".

Also, why would he tell people to smoke pot? He was on coke and booze constantly, and it was only a few months later that he told Bowie he hadn't smoked pot in years because all it does is dull the high.

You're all wrong I'm afraid; the lyrics are inspired by the original Space Invaders arcade game - simple as that.

""Out of the doorway the bullets rip..."" - moving out from behind the shield

""... to the sound of the beat"" - remember how the game had that beat that got faster and faster in time with the missiles

""How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone"" - what will you do when you've finished the game ? 

""You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own"" - You've spent all your money on it & had to leave the arcade

""Another one bites the dust, and another one gone and another one gone etc ..."" - well there were an awful lot of invaders on the screen

Did all you losers know that if you recite Hamlet's ""To be or not to be"" soliloquiy backwards that it says ""Frank Sinatra is God!"" please get a life! No, Hamlet does not work that way, but please take MY evil hidden message, not everything is planned. How many times have you said something that some one else took as a sex innuendo that wasn't meant as such? Plus, John Deacon (the author, no it was not Freddie) wrote simple songs, he admits to it, plus just look at the content.  if you want to look for hidden meanings why don't you try maybe one of Freddie's songs, or Brian's especially, but John? plus if there's arguement over what it says? come now. Let's get passed the obsession with Drug innuendo and try to discuss music like mature law abiding people.

All of the ideas that it's about marijuana are ridiculous...even if it does sound like that when played backwards, it was probably coincidential. Plus the power of suggestion may have something to do with it. People say, ""It sounds like, 'It's fun to smoke marijuana' when played backwards"" so when you play it backwards, you're looking for that phrase...if you hadn't been told otherwise, it might not sound so much like it. I dunno, I haven't actually heard it played backwards, I might be wrong, but I don't think it's about marijuana. And besides, I've heard that song lots of times, and I don't think any more of marijuana than I did before!

Sorry, I like to rant...so anyway, the meaning...not too deep, it just sounds like it's about violence on the streets is some places and how so many people are dying and how awful it is. Since John Deacon doesn't write terrible complex songs, I don't think it's about marriage, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was: ""There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man 
And bring him to the ground 
You can beat him 
You can cheat him 
You can treat him bad and leave him 
When he's down""

Just one question though...why do people think that so many Queen songs are a reference to Freddie's AIDS? A lot of these songs they think have to do with AIDS were a) written before Freddie new he had AIDS, b) written by another band member, or c) all of the above.

Ok, I'm done! :D

None of use believed it to be possible but the next day my teacher brought an original copy of this song put the needle of the record player on the record and spun it backwards and when turned at the correct speed the whole class clearly heard ""you should smoke marijauna"". I am not lying and I am not saying tha Queen was trying to start some drug revolution. They could simply have done it as a joke but the fact is that the encoded message myth is true.

ok these comments about fucking her before he leaves just ruined this whole song for me. I think hes saying he doesn't want to forget this girl and he can't see any other man having her but him. This is a really sweet song that some of these people have just ruined.

It's not just about him wanting to bang before he leaves, he's talking about a summer romance. He met a girl over summer vacation, and he doesn't want to forget her after the vacation is done. ""So tonight I hope that I will do just fine"" is him saying how he knows this could be the last time he ever sees this girl, a girl he had true feelings for but has to leave to get back to his life elsewhere. ""I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine"" - He will always have feelings for this girl, knowing that she may be ""the one who got away"".

When he says that he loves her and they laugh b/c they know it isnt true, i think its referring to summer love, because they prob just met, so they both its not really love, they just want to think it is.

@J E N N A 















I think that this song is about a summer romance (even though it could apply to any situation), and the boy is going to Cleveland either for school, job, etc.  Regardless of why he's going, he's leaving this girl behind.  He obviously has feelings for her and doesn't want to leave, which is why he can't see her as ""anything but mine.""  While they are listening to the local band, everything feels right, and he tells her he loves her.  Then he laughs, but I imagine it to be an awkward/forced laugh that he uses to cover up his true feelings for her.  The video is beautiful, and seeing Kenny play this last night in Chicago was amazing.  The video shows that the boy writes this song as a goodbye for the girl, which she receives the next morning after he has left.  Just a beautiful song that so many can relate to.

@drummer_girl803 















gosh, you guys all make it sound like he's just a crazy teenage guy looking for a girl to bang. he's really in love with her, and the reason they 'both laugh, cuz we know it isnt true' is that theyre trying not to make things worse when he has to leave. its really sweet, and i love the video. it reminds me of this guy from florida...perfect summer romance song!

My favorite Kenny Chesney song.  I love the way the lyrics and the melody blend together.  Like they were meant for each other and are inseparable.  And so descriptive.  Anyway here is the meaning according to Clint Eastwood.

The key to this is that Mary's got a boyfriend already and it's not him.  How are all you people missing this?  So he and Mary have become really close friends (and maybe lovers but I think not) and would be a real couple except for her boyfriend (fiancÃ©e?).  He and Mary are probably the same age and the boyfriend is older (sound familiar?) and she can't leave the boyfriend because he probably has a job and real prospects or whatever.  

When he says ""So tonight I hope that I will do just fine"" he is hoping that he can be the same friend they have been in the short time they have been together.

But it sucks because he really, really wants her and he can't see her being with the real boyfriend.

Great song!

I remember when I just started loving music, it was country. Now, I can barely listen to the stuff, it's mostly corny, unoriginal bullshit.

But the nostalgia is just SO intoxicating and it kind of makes me cry when I hear songs like these. Cause I was young and didn't think about anything but music and my friends. And now I think about too much. I didn't care about money, worry about my mom, I didn't come home from school every day miserable. I remember listening to this song in the car with my mom. 

I used to love Gretchen Wilson :) (still kind of do but don't tell anyone)

Now, I love Radiohead, Nirvana, Lady Gaga, Madonna, and the Smashing Pumpkins. Just like my life, my music tastes have completely changed.

Love this song.  It reminds me of how when my relationship started it was a long distance one.  I lived in Southern California and he lived eight hours away in my hometown in Northern California.  Granted, that's not the longest distance ever, and saw each other about once a month, and eventually were able to move closer together and stay together, but it was hard spending time together and then having to watch him leave or having to be the one to leave, especially in the beginning of the relationship because we weren't sure where it was going at first due to the distance.

You can interpret so much about this song, which is kinda the point of good songs, it makes you think and there are probably no ""right"" answers (I don't know, ask Kenny, or whoever it was who wrote the actual song!).  But this is what I think:

I think he's spent the summer (or maybe even less than that) with a girl and he has to return home and this is his last night with her.  He does want to have sex with her before he leaves (""there's so much I want to do to you"" and ""Tonight I hope I will do just fine"" are quotes that seriously indicate that), but it is clear he really cares about her so while he wants to have sex with her, I believe one of the reasons is that he really wants to leave her with a good impression with her, which is why he hopes he will do just fine.  

It does bother me when it says ""In the midst of the music I tell her I love her but we both laugh cause we know it isn't true."" But what I think it means is that they haven't spent enough time together to know if it is really ""love,"" and they know they can't be together at the moment due to him having to go back to Cleveland, so ""love"" really isn't even a possibility at that point in time.  I also think that telling her he loves her would create a heavy mood, and it seems like they are just trying to enjoy their last night together and have fun and not allow things to feel too serious or sad, although it seems he is very sad and trying to hide it.  I think the music brought out an honest feeling out of him, so he says he loves her, but then they laugh because it was unexpected and with him leaving the next day, there's no point in saying it.  He doesn't really know where things are going right now, so there is a lot of confusion.  With him saying ""I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine,"" alludes to the fact that there is a possibility he will see her again, or that they've made some sort of future plans, but he isn't 100 percent sure there will be a follow through.  

Or maybe he was doing the typical guy-thing and telling he loves her so he can get laid, but cares about her too much to lie to her, so he laughs after... either way, he is being really honest with her which shows that he does have deep feelings.

I think the line ""I hope I will do just fine,"" simply means he wants to leave a good impression on her or perhaps he is losing his virginity.  It seems like a young romance.  

Someone suggested that Mary has a boyfriend and that he's just her friend, so that's why he says ""I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine.""  There's no mention of another guy in the picture, but who knows.  I think he just can't picture her with anybody else or himself with anybody else.  

I think ""I don't see how you could ever be anything but mine"" means that he can't picture her with anyone else, so he thinks that fate will somehow bring them back together again.  It's like he has faith that they have found such a great connection that he trusts they will be able to connect again and I think him wanting to take their relationship to the physical level is part of that faith that they will somehow see each other again.  

He believes what they have found is not easily replaceable and he can't picture anyone else entering the picture, so he is hopeful he will really get to see her again.

This song takes me back to the summer when i went to Washington D.C. for a band trip. I basically fell in love with one of the boys on the trip with me. We did everything together, hung out the whole time, held hands, the whole bit. It was so cute one time when we got off the bus i ran to him and jumped in his arms and we hugged for so long it was like a scene from one of those romantic movies. His friend recently told me that he said we were ""meant to be"" and let me tell you, that melted my heart. i hope he still feels the same because i would gladly be with him in a heart beat. He is still to this day the sweetest guy ive ever met. he will always have a special place in my heart no matter what the future brings.

This tune is a religious experience. Is it the chorale that's backing her up? Is it the way her voice toys with you, only hinting at the power that it packs, until knocking you dead toward the end? Maybe it's that it brings you back to the depth of those few friendships that you'll never let go of. Whatever it is, the woman who has proven to me that M.C. is far more than T&A is  worthy of being here with me as I become a fan.

By the way, Mariah WROTE THE MUSIC. All I can say is that, for you musicians out there, go ahead and pick out these chords - they're brilliant!

AD: ""As I Sat Sadly By Her Side"" is the first single taken from ""No More Shall We Part"". Can you tell us about the song and why it was chosen as the first release from the album?

Well, I just really like that song. It's got a bit of pace to it. Quite a few of the other songs were quite slow and we didn't want to do that again, really. So it does have a bit of pace to it. The song itself is a philosophic kind of discussion between two people, which happens to be myself and my wife looking out through a window at the nature of the world and of our internal worlds. She's seeing everything as wonderful and beautiful and I retort with the other side of the story about humanity and (in) the third verse she admonishes me for being such a miserable old bastard and that's pretty much what that song's all about.

I'm not sure why it's thought the the male in the song wins the argument. She has the last word, kitten in hand, and her point is quite right. 

We are - each of us - trapped in our individual consciousness. We are to be judged (by god, others, the force, whatever) on what WE do in life, not what happens external to us. 


""""When will you ever learn
That what happens there beyond the glass
Is simply none of your concern?
God has given you but one heart
You are not a home for the hearts of your brothers""

The rights and wrong of other people's actions have no bearing at all on what we do in life. So long as your own actions are right, all is well.


""And God does not care for your benevolence
Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others""

Morality isn't about going out of your way to help others, it's about not doing wrong things or making bad decisions. Helping others is good, but it's not what's important. 


""Nor does he care for you to sit
At windows in judgment of the world he created""

In other words: get your own ship in order before looking over that of other people!

If anything she makes his argument look stupid. her tears are probably because he doesn't get it. His smile may be because actually he does. He's just enjoying being depressed. lol

Thank you so very much for posting this amazing song aj2828aj! I am not as familiar with the music of Mr. Cave as I plan to be. I saw the music video for this song and fell in love. Now that I have read the lyrics, I am only more enthralled. Mr. Cave speaks of a balance one can only hope to achieve. Yet he lends sympathy to those who dwell on the darker side, the outside. Those, like myself, who see the beauty and pain of this world and often become ""ugly, useless, and over-inflated"" for no damn good reason... smiling all the time.

I think everyone's got the ""winner"" and ""loser"" of the argument in this video reversed.

He's sitting above everything, looking down on it.  He thinks he's better than everyone below.  He sees everyone else as looking out for only themselves.  

I hear sarcasm when she talks about his ""benevolence.""  Then she talks about all the ugliness he lets pile up around him.

He's self-righteous and useless.  He keeps himself apart.  He only speaks of the evils of the world.  And all the time, he does nothing to make the world any better.

But he doesn't hear her.  He takes a macabre comfort from the pain and suffering of others.  This is why he smiles as he sits sadly by her side.  He can't even see that he's sitting in his own grave.

@LograyX 















First of all, the dialogue reminds a bit of the end of the Book of Job in which Job finally protests against the things God made him go through, while God explains the incredible beauty of the world he created (the Leviathan, fathers, mothers etc).

After which, God somehow reinstates Job to a more happy state.

From my point of view, the final verse can be seen in two ways: she reproaches him the fact that he is judgemental, but at the last moment she is also judgemental
( Nor does he care for you to sit/At windows in judgement of the world He created/While sorrows pile up around you/Ugly, useless and over-inflated ), so she bursts into crying, while he smiles because of winning the argument. This makes sense, but it's a bit mundane.

The second way  - it takes a lot of energy to be able to see the world the way she does and even more - to convince somebody of this worldview (energy draining which makes her cry). Seeing the world as he does is anyway useless and her determination to cure him (the one she loves) of piling up sorrows around him finally makes him smile (although he still sits sadly, the world in the background did not actually change). It's like a transfer of states from one to the other.

@grasshopperid 















There are hints in this song that the woman he is speaking to may be ill or dying, or perhaps that she has attempted suicide. For instance, he sits 'sadly by her side' as though sitting with someone very sick, and he brushes the hair from her face as though she were unable to do so herself. She is sitting looking out of a window with a kitten in her lap too, which makes her seem like an invalid.

I think this song has a rather nasty ending. When the woman becomes angry with the protagonist and tells him not to sit in judgment on the world and starts to cry he can't stop smiling - as though he knows he's convinced her that there is evil in the world and has somehow 'won' the conversation. In the context of her being sick or otherwise the weaker participant in the conversation this is a particularly black ending.

An absolutely amazing song, anyway.

He convinces a naïve believer that there are unexplainable  evil in the world, from a believers perspective. It is partly about the teodecie problem.

The hair is something that blocks her eyes, here ability to see clearly. But he finally reaches here with his argument and then she attacks him with a tantrum and says that he is wrong, but the very tantrum is the evidence of him being right, thereby smiling.

I believe it's the man whose disgusted with her lack of care. At first , they look as one out the window. Then , with different faces. She has a glimpse of his care at a moment but he then has to move the hair out of her eyes in order for her to continue seeing . She mentionf family and professions , things that he cares for but she's wanting him all for herself. The kitten represents how they wash hold humanity in a different way. She is passive. She is angry that his heart is not cold and points out that its not a home do his brother , nor does what happens behinds that curtains is none of your concerns . Also , sadly he feels sorry for her lack of empathy . He smiles in sadness and disgust. 

If you'll look at the new video just released, all type footage is about loss of love.

I concur:  the woman is not remotely indicated to be invalid or ill as I hear the song.  That would not be necessary to this story and Cave doesn't really bandy words.

Hair?  I see  it as a common gesture of those already intimately acquainted.  One could say it is also a symbolic inquiry:  reaching out to test the reaction.
remember: ""with a trembling hand...""
I would buy into the 'barrier' symbol mentioned above, except that in this tale, the barrier does not come up until After he has had his say.

Kitten:  Always stood out to me and I think that it can represent this woman's heart which she gives to him and retracts just as quickly in reaction to his world-view.

Cave is a fantastic poet, one of my favorite, and I too, will appreciate his outlining of those dark things that permeate any good and whole human life.

I assume (due to the music video) that a boy is in love with a girl, but her father will not let her see him. They make a plan to runaway together. When the girls father discovers that she is missing, he goes to find her. When he does find her, he beats up the boy and leaves him laying in the street, all bloody and beaten. He takes his daughter and the girl is screaming telling the boy to get up and go.

@KrisGirl34 















In this song, the singer sings about love being more important than money, a theme that is completely original and no one else in the history of the universe has touched upon. The fact that Justin is a celebrity wealthy beyond the imaginations of most people in the world makes this song completely genuine, as does his comparison of himself to a soldier despite no military service. The verse by Big Sean makes perfect sense and is integral to the song and in fact should be made into a separate single.

Justin testifies how true love can overcome all circumstances on this Believe electro jam. He sings, ""As long as you love me. We could be starving. We could be broke,"" which is a predicament the Canadian star is unlikely to encounter over the next few years. However, having experienced a childhood being raised by a single mother in low-income housing, Justin has experienced financial hardship.


The song features a rapped verse from ""My Last"" rapper Big Sean, who is signed to Kanye West's G.O.O.D. label.


This shares a title with a 1997 international hit by the Backstreet Boys. The pop band took to Twitter to remind Beliebers that they were first. ""I don't care who you are, where you're from, what you did #AsLongAsYouLoveMe,"" they wrote.


Justin persuaded producer Rodney Jerkins to add the dubstep-heavy sonics after a trip to London. The Canadian singer got hooked on dubstep during a trip to the UK, where the bass-driven type of electronic music is all over the radio.


Big Sean revealed to MTV News that on the same day he was recruited to work with Justin, the rapper got a call from an artist whose cussing content is the polar opposite to the Canadian pop star's PG lyrics. ""It's crazy! I got a call from Gucci Mane the same day I got a call from Bieber and his people to do two different projects,"" he recalled. ""It's tight that I can be a person that's so diverse that I can do both of those and it's not reaching. I'm still me... and I didn't compromise anything for Bieber. You know, I just didn't curse, which is easy. I don't have to curse every day.""


The song's music video was directed by Anthony Mandler, who has worked with everyone from Rihanna to Usher. Actor Michael Madsen, who has also had notable roles in movies like Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill and Sin City, stars in the clip alongside Justin and Big Sean.


Michael Madsen plays the disapproving father of Justin's love interest in the visual and ends up beating up the star after he ignores his request to stay away from his daughter. The actor told MTV News that Bieber was more concerned about having it look real than scared to take the hit. ""He was very respectful, very respectful and decent to me,"" said Madsen. ""I think he wanted it to be well-done. I don't think he was blowing it off. I think that I've been around enough to know I can tell if somebody isn't really doing their job or taking what they do seriously. And I could tell from early on in the morning that he was. He wanted it to be right.""

Not to take anything from Frank Sinatra or many of the other folks that sang this song, but it's crucial to point out that Dooley Wilson's take on it, which is the version from ""Casablanca,"" is the quintessential version.  He delivered the song in a manner that it was meant to be delivered.  Simply put, it was meant to be sung that way.

As for it's meaning, I always thought it paralleled the movie's theme, which was one of sacrifice of love for greater causes (like saving the world).

This song is about a truck driver who has to work hard and sacrifice being with his girl to make ends meet. He has to get up early each morning to drive truck loads to different parts of the country.  He explains ""I don't want to leave your side""  The best part of the song is when he expalins ""I'm on a ride that won't let me go.""  This means he has to do what he has to do in order to provide people with what they need around the country, but also for his wife.  All he wants to do is be with her.  He "" sees her picture by the dashboard light and it takes me where I'd like to be""  Who hasn't been away from someone they care about and all they can think about is that person.

I agree with dork alert, she went to Austin and he knew that, so he just said ""If this is Austin"" because she'd know what he meant if she called and also probably because no one else would know he was talking about her if they got his answering machine.

I don't get it. How can this song exist, and then there are thousands of great songs throughout history that have been nearly, if not completely, forgotten? What about all the great artists in history that actually played instruments?

What happened to songwriters like John Lennon? What happened to clever rhymes and clever lyrics and lyrics filled with fun innuendos? Are we really doomed to ""Baby (x9) Thought you'd always be mine"" as every song's chorus? What has the songwriting (and music world, in general) gone to?

My last questions: Do you really think people are going to remember Justin Bieber in 25 years time? Will he make Rolling Stone's 100 Best Artists list, like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones and The Beach Boys and all the other great groups before ""he"" came along? Because we've remembered The Beatles for almost 50 years... Just making that a little point......

Simple-This song has no meaning. It's just a teenager who hasn't yet hit puberty, sings like a laughing kookaboora (Spelling, sorry,), and has no talent whatsoever. This kid is fucking 15, hitting 16, maybe even 16 already. How the holy hearts does he know what love means? What a fucking loser.

I'm also sick of all these fangirls bitching and saying ""This song was wrote for me!!!!!11111"". Dears, he doesn't even KNOW YOU. He's just another talentless lowlife/loser who plays his 'music' only for gaining money, not for putting time and effort into his so-called 'music'. This little poser doesn't give two shits about you, so fuck off and stop complaining. Sorry for my cussing, I just needed to get all this loserome out of my brain.

@TOOLrule3 















Everyone is being so shallow about this song! Don't you know Justin Bieber only keeps his ""hot teen that all the 12 year-old girls want to sleep with"" image so that he can hide the darker side of his lyrics, because he can not go without saying the things that hurt him deep inside, but he also does not want anyone to know about what he feels because they would never understand anyway?

But I understand Justin. I understand it all.

This song is about the internal struggle of a boy with the meaning and purpose of the ""self"", after coming to the conclusion that nothing but Nihilism explains all of the questions and concerns he has about life and the universe. 

The song takes an especially strong view on the idea of ""ignorance is bliss"" and Justin's constant references to his childhood are about how he wish he could go back to a time when he did not understand or know anything, and did not have to suffer from the realisation that all life is without purpose. 

The ""baby, baby"" is referring not to a girl, but actually to himself as a baby, and the ""ahhs and oooohs"" are pathetic attempts to replicate the sounds he used to make at that time, because out of his desperation he is willing to try anything to go back to when he did not understand anything. The ""thought you'd always be mine"" is of course about his innocence and how he thought he could stay ignorant and blissful forever.

The verses are about how he slowly lost his ignorance over the years, as he learned that the things society teaches us can make us happy (possessions, money, love) made him happy at first ""I'll buy you any ring"", but slowly he finds they are meaningless ""When I was 13, I had my first love, There was nobody that compared to my baby (once again referring to how there was nothing like the ignorant bliss he had as a child)"", and as he keeps living his life he finds that materials and emotions have no value, and Justin struggles to hold onto things but he can not stop a nihilistic view from taking hold of him, ""And I wanna play it cool/But I'm losin' you"".

Finally the last verse is a bit ambiguous. The ""I'm gone"" could be referring to the ""self"", i.e. with Nihilsm completely taking over him he now has no conception of himself, and so he is now an empty shell without anyone inside (therefore he in essence is gone, even if his body is still there), OR it could also mean that in his struggle with Nihilism the only way out he could think of was suicide, so the ""I'm gone"" could refer to his falling into the pit of despair and killing himself, but I don't know for sure. You'd have to ask Justin in person to find out...

			That is a very thoughtful interpretation, but I cannot help but think you missed... everything. I don't mean to be hateful. Please do not mistake this is a toll or me as a hater.

The very second verse kill everything you just said. ""Are we an item, GIRL quit playin'. We're just friends? What are you sayin'?"" That is very obviously talking to a girl about a relationship that he was taking much more seriously than she. ""Is there another, look right in my eyes."" Again, talking to a person. Childhood innocence cannot leave you for another person.

After that, we need to take a look music video. I am aware that those are not always reliable, but he is chasing a girl throughout the entire thing. He is talking to her, and trying after her. Again the lyrics point ""I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring."" First, how would he give those to innocence, and generally, why would the innocence of a male child care? (one could say that he is just that effeminate, but that is an entirely different cobweb.)

So what about his real life? Do we see any evidence there? He was going to interview after interview. Believe me, I have watched them all. He is one of the happiest kids anyone has ever seen. After making the music video, he engaged in a romantic relationship with Jasmine V, then after, Selena Gomez. Also, importantly, he did not commit suicide. The only evidence I can see is the seemingly sudden jump he had into adrenaline related activities, like bungee jumping.

Also, he wrote this song with other people. I mean to say a lot of other people. If he is so sensitive about this subject and ""Doesn't want anyone to know about what he feels,"" I would think that he would be writing it by himself and neglecting the help he so readily took.

This part, has a good deal of what some would call hate. I call it disappointment, since his older music (like say... ""Never Let You Go"" was so much better). I can't help but think that if he had the ability and motivation to put that much of himself into his songs, he would not be writing the superficial and generally thoughtless thing he is writing now. 

I would love to believe he is that deep (not that I want him to be dropping into Nihilism), but I just do not see the evidence. If you want to listen to a song that is an example of a person without much meaning in there life, Motion City Soundtrack is a goldmine. You could listen to ""Skin and Bones,"" ""Circuits and Wires,"" or even ""Disappear"" if you interpret it that way. (I don't really know what is going on in that song.

If you think I am missing something, please offer a reply. I would hate to be missing as much as I would have to be to be contradicting you, should you be right. I know it has been years since you wrote that comment, but I just saw it today.

It is about the 'war on terror' and the reactionary nature of western democratic
governments. The 'wake me' bit is about the people killed by the guns that are caught
in the middle of the war they never wanted held in their country. After the 'first love
still around' bit it switches perspectives to the western government where they claim
the real reason to start all this is to get oil.

HAHA. As if.
In 20 years who will know Justin Beiber?
Absolutely No-one.

"
101,Back It Up.json,nil
102,Back On It.json,nil
103,Back to a Reason (Part II).json,"
One of the most powerful songs I've ever heard. The song actually begins at ""time, standing all alone"" and everything before that is just part of the story written by Jon Oliva of TSO. The full story can be read on their website. It's beautiful, extremely touching and magical, and this is coming from an atheist.

Meaning:

This particular song deals with the father's feelings of guilt and hopelessness after taking the time to think about how he abandoned his child, and how much time he has wasted on a meaningless life with no love or friends. With these thoughts, he decides to go to his son, telling himself his son is the only reason he has left to live.

""Time - Still they fall on and on and on""
These lines refer to his past relationship and dead wife. They were a happy couple with everything, but lost it all so suddenly. The bleeding refers to the wound in the man's soul, which bleeds eternally ever since the wound his wife's death had on him. The ""falling in vain"" may also refer to his drops of blood, continually falling, or it may refer to the ghost of his wife's tears, mentioned in the beginning of the story, which eventually froze into snowflakes.

""Got to get back to a reason - Fade from view""
He's trying to remember the way he felt about life when he lived for his wife, and regain that meaning in his life. ""This late in the seasons"" refers to how during Christmas, what's important seems to become clearer to us, and the things that lead us astray from such things are not present at this time.

""Drifting through the dark - On and on""
Literally refers to his late excursion on this Christmas night. The ""Is you life the same?"" verses may be him referring to his dead wife, again asking if she cries tears, and feels the years of time passing (Which, in the story, she does).

""I'm looking for you - End""
This is him finally facing his past, present, and future. Realizing he has wasted so much of his life, and doesn't have much time left to make anything of it. It examines his fear of ""waking up,"" meaning, facing his miserable life for what it really is, and ceasing to live in the cold cage he has built around himself. With the remainder of his time, in these moments he is finding the strength to make right what he still can, and face his problems on this night of Christmas. He finally decides that he will do whatever he still can to get to his son.

On a deeper note:
Although this song has a very specific meaning as part of a story, I believe it can loosely be applied to nearly anyone who feels as though they are living only to live, perhaps suffering or in pain, and feeling the weight of time and the past. The fear of seeing life for what it really is is indeed dreadfully scary, and living in a dream is what many seem to do to avoid it. Of course, it can just as well be a song of hope, to those who have finally found something or someone in their life to live for.

104,Back to You.json,nil

I personally, am a sucker for any song with a LGBTQ+ or poly theme, and as usual, our bisexual friend Halsey does not disappoint. In “Bad At Love,” we see Halsey battle one of the largest problems that face individuals when they join together to become a couple – the idea that one partner as the ability to “fix” the other. We watch as Halsey jumps from relationship to relationship trying to find someone who will deal with her emotional baggage so that she doesn’t have to. She cites her struggles with jealousy as well as emotional distance she can feel in relationships as reasons why she’s “bad at love,” but she clearly has no interest in trying to improve her emotional unavailability, only to wait for the right person to come around and fix it. I’m hoping to hear a new hit from Halsey about the benefits of therapy and an
awesome new girlfriend (or girlfriends?!) but I suppose we’ll have to wait and see…

			 She is the cause of his hurt and pain. You can almost hear the sound of shame in her voice. She is ashamed and just wants to hide and not deal with the pain she inflicted on that person. She just flees the entire situation. Out of site out of mind. 			

			That's not an interpretation of the song's meaning. It's a literal summary of the plot. Yes, knowing the plot is important towards understanding the meaning of a song, but it is not necessarily the meaning of the song in and of itself. 			

			BitchyFace84 who's ""she"" that you're refering to? The chick singing the chorus? This song's more about Eminem.			

The first part of the song is a continuation of the story from the song ""Stan"", which was on the first MMLP. It is given from the perspective of Stanley Mitchell's little brother, Matthew. Stan was a mentally unstable fan of Eminem who wrote letters to him, with his mental state visually deteriorating with each successive letter. Em doesn't receive the letters because of a ""problem at the post office"". Stan thinks that Em is ignoring him, and eventually drives his car off a bridge with his pregnant girlfriend in the trunk, killing her too.

This song is the aftermath of Em's ""Stan"" song, it shows how Matthew ""Stans little brother"" is affected by Stans death and how he finds and gets revenge on Eminem for what he supposedly did to his brother.

109,Bad Liar.json,"
This song is basically about how a person is a bad liar and lies all the time and tries to make excuses, and in this song he's telling the truth about how he is a bad liar and how he wants the person he is talking to to believe him one last time.

"
110,Bad Reputation.json,"
In the song ""Bad Reputation"", Shawn is inferring to the fact that even though this girl was seen in a negative way, he did not care what others said about her. In the line ""And all of my friend seen her naked"", it refers she has slept around with many guys, but Shawn knows things about her that no one else understands. It's a powerful song because we all mistakes, and he is saying he doesn't care what others think.

Overall a 10/10 recommended song:)

			It's not that kind of battery. obviously.  It's battery as in 'assault & battery'.  Have you considered reading the lyrics?			

It's gotta be about a mosh pit, or just the general crowd at a concert. There is tremendous energy like a battery and ""pounding out aggression, turns into obsession"" sums up a metal concert for me. It's also like a big family, and is in all of us.

Eminem said this was a track he wrote in Rehab, right before he got sober. He wrote the first half in rehab and finished it when he got out. For me this song has very special meaning because it describes the times I am going through with my struggles in my addiction recovery. So below I have written my interpretation as if he were writing this about entering recovery, and using the mic and rap as references to drugs, here is how I saw it before I knew what was behind it:

1) In the first few lines when he speaks of being depressed and needing to get out of a slump, I took that as his feeling before he hit rock bottom, that he needed to find another way besides drugs to get him feeling better again, written right before he got clean.

2) In the second lines he is saying he took his hits (im not referencing hits of drugs and neither was he) and got back up, but even though he was getting through things he wasn't getting through them sober, so where he references he needed a spark, maybe he is saying he needs a spark to get him to pick his life back up again, and get clean.

3) When he says he doesnt know how he ended up in the situation he is in, that he was feeling distant again, I could see that being he is feeling distant from himself, not knowing the real him because he had been hiding behind substance for so long. So he picked up the pen, started to do step work from the 12 steps.

4) He up and tried to vent, speaking up in meetings and talking about his addiction, and seeing that he needs to come to grips with his addiction and accept he is done with drugs, and find a new way of life and living. 

5) By saying he is a tough act to follow he is saying he had a horrible and trifling addiction, that many havent been through, and walking in his shoes is saying it is hard to feel that you fit in with those around you in recovery, and by switching places he could feel what they feel clean, because he wants what they have.

As addicts we have a very low self confidence and low self respect, so he is saying that dont let anyone put you down because of your struggles, dont let them tell you that you arent good enough, but that your strong and beautiful inside. The man servant could be referring to his sponsor, the telling people his tale could be him sharing his struggles with the room. Him not going into these rooms for attention but to get clean and begin a new way of life. By referring to his dad not showing up, this could be an admittance of where his addiction began was the constant abandonment and lack of love. Or referring to fitting in and he did stupid things such as drugs to fit in with the cool kids. 

The most touching part of this song is when he is referencing the cards we are dealt, I have felt that because of my addiction and the things I have done, I feel like I have always been dealt the shitty hand, but he is saying that take what you have and deal with it, sober, because god gave us a place in this world for a reason, so flip em and figure it out, and do it sober, it will mean more.

I am seeing this song from an addicts perspective, I am 3 weeks clean and can relate to this song as if I wrote it, with the mic and rap representing life and drugs, he has proven himself once again with this song, it is one of his best he has ever produced.

Sorry if I babbled, or offended anyone, but this song is deep, and for any other addicts in recovery out there,  I think this really hits close to home.

This song makes no sense at all, it's completely meaning less. Sure it sounds pretty but the lyrics are horrible ""we're gonna party like it's 3012 tonight""...what? 

This is the one of the most shallow song I've heard. Not one line in this song has any meaning ""Body rock, girl, I can feel your body rock"" I mean really? I guess you would say it's about....dancing maybe. This song has no story, Justin Bieber would only write this song for fame.

I think it has to go with God in the way in the second verse he says ""send a prayer to the ones up above."" Apparently, the pain has shaped him and made him who he is right now. It has also made him a believer in God.

It seems as if the whole song is just a prayer to God.

This is my interpretation 
First verse: I’m gonna say everything I’m thinking because I’ve kept it bottled up for so long don’t tell me what i should be peoples stereotypes and expectations don’t define me
Pre chorus : I had a lot of problems when I was younger and I would take my problems to people. I would write for the few people that looked at me and cared about me Singing about my heart ache I’m taking my message from inside/my heart talking about what’ve learned and seeing the best things from the worse
Chorus:pain made me see the good things even in the worst of times somethings that break me down such as pain still build me up my love my life and my drive all came from pain
Verse 2: send a pray to the people in heaven that are no longer with us and thank them for the impact the have had in your life and try to avoid all the hate you have heard and be peaceful like a dove (states  in the about doves being the sign of peace
Pre chorus:I was a regular person dreaming about a different life and I started falling down I was hoping my feeling would go away but the didn’t and then it caused me pain because I kept them bottled up
Bridge: last thing the grace of the Holy Spirit (in the church they consider fire and flames a sign of the Holy Spirit) is the future and the thing that keeps me alive  and my feelings being bottled up finally effected me

An aimless man meets, falls for and finds out about the facts life from a strong woman who's philosophy and criticisms are grounded in reality. He objects to her harshness but life prooves her right about everything.  He's improving and he wants her but it's a backwards relationship and her interest in him fades with his inability to take charge.
 Love desire and pain are sometimes partners.

This is a brutally honest song. So many times, we hold onto relationships because basically we don't have the guts to end it.

By far one of Kenny's greatest songs, both vocally and lyrically. He's saying that in the end, no matter how much it's hurting her right now, he is not the right guy for her. Throughout the song he lists off his qualities, stating that who he is just isn't the right fit for her. He sees her starting to fall in love with him, he can tell that it would be an unrequited love, so he's ending it now in attempt to save her from further pain.

This song is about a guy lets call him ""Nick"" for arguements sake and he loves a girl and she loves him but he really doesnt know what he wants and is still finding out who he is. He's somewhat of a loner but he's happy with it because it works for him, and she accepted him that way because he's honest to a fault.

He needs to let her go so she can be happy...
""I see you leaning, you're bound to fall,
I don't want to be that mistake"" 

 He doesnt want to break her heart anymore because he know he will.  So he let's her go and it hurts her but he knows in the long run she's going to find a man that loves her the way she deserves cause she's probably really hot!

So below are the verses where he says trust me pretty much someday you'll thank me for letting you go...

But one day you're gonna find someone,
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
It was just a part of the passing through

Right there in that moment 
You'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man...
Better as a memory than as your man

So she met a great guy amazing in fact and she sees what he was saying finally but she always will love him.


So that's the story. Nicks dumb but hey whats a girl to do ya know? He's probably some mad skill guitar player musician that loves his guitar more than any really hot girl.  What an idiot! 
P.S- She wants Joint Custody of his dog.
P.P.S-  She will never forget this boy, and kept a plank for that pirate man on her bridge.
The End. But not really.

It's just about the tour de france and how Freddy loves riding his bike.  You guys are obsessed with finding gay connection in every queen song its insane.  I mean, there was even a post in We Will Rock You saying it was a gay pride anthem.  It wasn't even written by Freddy for god's sake, it was Brain May's song.  Just because he was gay doesn't mean every song is about that.

@gimpyx2k  Brian said that Freddie did not like riding a bicycle and he actually liked the things he said he didn't on the song. He said Freddie wrote it because the tour de France was passing the area they were recording and he was fascinated by watching them go by (and, sorry for the ""gay"" reference, watching their thick bottoms in tight bike shorts). Brian said he wrote ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" around the same time as a ribbing of Freddie's interest in the ""fat bottomed"" girls and boys riding by.

Anyone saying We Will Rock You was a gay pride anthem is just an idiot. It was a very aggressive, (very heterosexual) Brian song meant to let the audience participate with 8-10 people's foot stamps and hand claps that were repeated using Brian's hand-calculated logarithms  (nerd alert) to make it sound like it was happening in a stadium.

laragiesbrecht summed it up. i also think that it's about not being judges as a child by doing immature things, such as riding a bicycle. also being free from society and doing the things that you want to do. although freddie mercury was bi, it doesnt mean that all of his songs are about being gay or bi

i wouldn't call it a metaphor, i would just say that some of the lyrics alude to to sex. it doesn't mean sex, it just suggests it. I think there's a difference.

I really do think its about sex. He's cleverly puttin it in a sense where it could be where theyre gonna go to a show in town but occasionally when someone says wanna go to town it means hey wanna have sex hah just sayin from non-personal experiences..but also when its like you can climb up in my lap and drive if you want too is basically sayin get on top lol



IDK maybe it isnt about that, but im pretty sure when he was makin the song he also saw that it kinda sounds related to that subject too..but again it is a country so it really could be as simple as ridin a big green tractor

If only it were big RED tractor...

But this song is amazing. I would always sit on the fender of by exboyfriend's tractor while raking hay. Just crack a beer and watch the day go by. After we were done with a long day in the fields we'd just part it up on the ridge and watch the sun set behind the farm. Such a beautiful thing. Defenitely brings back some memories. A really bittersweet song.

			 That's truly awesome. Very jealous. Memories in the suburbs suck. I hope to move out to the country when I'm worn out of the partying and the city. Have a nice quiet country life and raise my kids out there so they can experience a life I didn't. Maybe I'm romanticizing it but I'd like to live out in the country fields. Your description made me realize that alot. That's very cool.

Such a beautiful song, and such great comments.  One person stated that Sir Paul himself recently said the song was written about troubled girls in South America in the 60's.  I'm going to look more on the internet, but if Sir Paul did say that, well, he would be the one to know.

To me, part of the beauty of art, including poetry and song, is to explore what it means to you, in your own mind. As a physician with a busy schedule I still long for a day when I can take classes and explore art ddeply.   It opens my mind, creating new ways of thinking, new ideas, news ways to express old ideas, realizations and better understanding of myself, and connection and openness to everyone and everything around me.

I first heard this song this week, on an episode of Glee.  I actually thought it was about death, and the release from human limitation and suffering into an afterlife of peace and freedom. I'm so glad I looked for the lyrics and found this website!  I appreciate all your comments and points of view.  Isn't it interesting how our different lives and experiences have created so many different interpretations of the same song?  I wish that, in our national discourse, we could all appreciate and respect the differences that make each of us unique and special.  That's much more interesting and beautiful to me than everyone thinking and acting and being the same.

I've seen Paul live twice, and both times, he played Blackbird, and both times, he said that it was about the civil rights movement. This would be backed up with ""You were only waiting for this moment, to be free""

@domjohnson That makes sense, also, when you look at the title. ""Bird"" is British slang for ""young woman"".  Taking that into consideration, the song could be about a black young woman.

A sweet anthemic gem. 

A bird with broken wings, black feathers against the bleak backdrop of a coal black night, yearning to break free. And that funny little paradoxical refrain - ""...into the light of a dark black night."" The mental image is a sliver of moon or winking stars, but really I take it to mean that no matter how metaphorically dark your surroundings, there is always a dim glimmer to be found. We all have our blackbird moments, and broken wings or not, it's up to us to hobble our way towards the light.

I played and sang this as a lullaby for my daughter for years.  She looked forward to hearing it every night.  She once said that she would like for me to play and sing it at her wedding.  But that was long ago.  I will always think of this song as the background music for any depiction, description or memory of the bond between her and me.  So maybe it'll play when Dad and newlywed daughter do their post-wedding dance...

I get the impression that the singer is trying to ""repair"" the burned bridges between himself and someone he cares deeply about. He is willing to sacrifice everything to make things right again. ""So I bare my skin and I count my sins"" give me the image of someone removing their shirt to receive lashes, and each lash represents one crime against the other person. He is showing repentance for his sins. ""So I close my eyes and I take it in"" represents trying to forgive himself so that they can move on. Of course, I connect with that interpretation so that could be why I chose that approach.

@Justinjah 















To me, this song is him singing to someone he loves who is going through pain.
I don't think he literally means bleed when he says ""bleeding out"". 

He loves this person so much, he is saying, I will take your pain. I will give everything (bare my skin), and I'll own up to everything I've done (count my sins) and I'll feel your pain for you, so you don't have to feel it anymore.

I don't think this song is about self-harm, mostly because of the line ""I will be your scarecrow"". He's saying there that he will chase away all of the darkness that's coming into that person's life.

Just how I hear it!

@rebeccast 















I love this song!
Most people feel that it's coming from depression and a will to harm others by your personal pain. I however feel that this is something much more encouraging and uplifting!
He's singing of self sacrifice for someone or others he cares about.  He knows that if he's going to bring someone down even to the last breath, he'd rather die.  He is putting his life out there, willing to live, to the last drop of blood, for the life of the other.
When he says ""Innocence is gone and what was right is wrong"", he realises that his wrongdoings and misunderstandings of what is right in life have been shown for the falsehood in which they live. How can he live with his nature if his nature is so twisted?  Another thought is that he sees himself as the ""one who knows"" and the ""right thing"" (looking the other way, or ""just living"" regardless of the internal destruction to others) is now the ""wrong thing"".

I have so much more I could pick out of this song, but I'd need a lot more space... ;)

			I totally agree with you. I also noticed that ""When your eyes are red and emptiness is all you know"" could mean two things. The obvious one is that the person he is talking about is evil and has red eyes, or they have been crying and their eyes are red. I just thought that was kind of cool.

I think the song is talking about self-harm and suicide. I think he wants to commit suicide because he feels like he is ruining someones life. He thinks he is the reason everything is going wrong in their life. ""If the last thing that I do is bring you down I'll bleed out for you"" sounds like its saying ""if I ruin anything else for you, I will just get rid of myself because I ruin everything"" Its a very good song...but it does seem like a very depressing one. 

Thats just what I think! =}

			""If the last thing that I do is bring you down I'll bleed out for you""- i think that line  is actually referring to how he will rather self harm and cope with pain that way rather than  committing suicide because he cant die on his loved ones. He doesnt want to cause any pain to his friends and family from commiting  suicide. ""I will reach inside
 Just to find my heart is beating""- saying he will do anything to keep himself alive

I'm obsessed with this song after hearing it the first time yesterday. Maybe I'm weird, but I find the lyrics both to be beautiful and tragic. The lyrics ""But innocence is gone and what was right is wrong,"" seems like you do something you realize is bad but it's too late too turn back. I just feel like this song is a transformation from innocence to 'corruptness,' whether it's cheating, your first drug or something small. 

Either way you interpret it, it's an amazing song.

@MkHammer 















I think this song is basically about someone going through self harm who has a person close to them that is trying to help them but they fail constantly (they self harm). Or just about someone who is going through self harm because of certain pain someone has given to them.

This is how I see it:
I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you) --> may also be a ritual for someone who self harms. ""So I take the blade, remember everything I've ever done wrong, close my eyes and take the blade into my skin (cut), and I bleed"" and then ""I bleed because you caused me so much pain"" (maybe)

When the day has come
But I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating ---> Everything is going downhill in his life and he feels numb (reach inside just to find my heart it beating). Self harm is also an escape for numbness, just to feel something.

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong ---> He holds on to someones words, but he can't stop.

'Cause I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I peel my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)

When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To feel they're not worth hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow --> It happens mostly at night. And this is a nice explanation for anyone who wants to understand what goes through a depressed person's mind. ""When your eyes are red"" - Crying ""And emptiness is all you know"" - You're empty, numb, unable to feel or be happy ""With the darkness fed"" - Depression makes you do ""sick stuff""


Just my personal opinion, as someone who used to self harm and went through depression i find this song relatable, anyways, beautiful song.

this is by far my favorite wsp song.  this is my take on it:  he's on the road, traveling, touring whatever and is homesick.  he thinks of these memories (pappy, sally), trying to get through the day (waiting for morning) and uses drugs to escape (medicine).
smelling the cornbread bake = he's starting to get high
then in goes ""still right here, brave friend"": that's his conscience or whatever telling him ""you're still not at home, even though you feel good, brave little friend: him, for taking these chances with drugs for nothing
so then he's all fucked up and partying and is happy with all these other people who are ""self-medicating"" for loneliness or unhappiness...or whatever
then morning comes, and everyone always feels better in the morning cause it's a fresh start, new day, etc., but he's ""still right here""

i don't know, maybe i'm crazy.  i guess that's just what it means for me

I feel the beauty of songs, and art in general, is that despite the intended meaning of the artist the song can take new meanig through others interpretations

It seems to me that this song is about a old, or sick dying man on his death bed. The morning being his impending death.

""Oh, Sally buffalo in the apartment just below
a bein' without a care
Oh, children from my brood they come and bring me food
Maybe open up a window for air""

I think this is talking about his children visiting him caring for him, but not providing much else for him.

			I think all music is what you yourself get out of it and everyone has different feelings but from the artist point of view I think it's him saying that hes in a familiar place and sees something he really loves and hes thinking about life and what comes next and the medicine is a drug or music or  his friends anything that makes him happy or keeps his mind off his worries and as he escapes  he hears the beautifull people go about life and has friends or nice people bring him stuff or come visit him and then he might try something new today and hes got a party going on where everything is ok and he will stay true to what he is and belives now everyone is having fun and he sees is at home where he belongs but he will still take any chance to do someting new if it comes the next day and explore his mind as he knows life is grand and just as the feeling of true happness

Here's what I see. Someone lying in bed waiting to die. 

His children come cook for him and bring him food.

""Oh, children from my brood they come and bring me food
Maybe open up a window for air""

The morphine pump.

""Oh, just now I smell the cornbread bake
Oh, now, now, now I feel the medicine take""

He's being fed through an IV bottle

""Half a bottle 'neath the bed keep our spirits fed
My hat's off to you, to you and you""

The spirits are here wanting to take him away


""And now our brave friends, too, dancing circles through the room
And a broom and a radio and a twistin out a dos-e-do""

He's ready to go


""Oh, just like, just like home
Where the stray dogs go
Oh, oh, rest my bones
Like a fresh skipped stone to it all""

But his time did not come yet...he is still there


""Still right here, still just here,
Still just here, brave, brave friend""

To me this is a song about how she is in love with a guy and wants to make a life with him.  The guy feels like he needs to get money in order for them to have a ""life"", a house, a car, kids and the American Dream.  In his haste he turns to drug dealing for easy money and winds up getting chewed up and spit out by the game.  In the end all she wanted was him, he was always enough, but he was convinced she would only be happy if they lived the good life, the rich life.  He pays the price by being taken away to prison and she has to wait for him.  She wants him to know that even though he has fucked up, she still loves him and longs for the simple love they once shared.

			I'm saying that he feels these invisible pressures that exist in American society.  More and more people are putting off getting married or having kids until everything is just right.  Until they have the money, until they have the house, until they have everything.  He feels those pressures and takes a risk to go make some quick money so they can have a life together.  

The reality is, he didn't need to go get money for them to have a life together.  That wasn't the life she necessarily wanted.  She was willing to make it work with whatever they had.

			There is no line that would make one believe that it was drugs, except gangster, which is much more general. There is really no line that says he went to prison, which two people have suggested. He disappeared after one day. So... maybe he was just ditching her? Maybe prison? Maybe he got rich and never came back? We don't know, the song's protagonist doesn't know.

The rest of this I agree with. 

I wish the line wasn't ""I'll wait a million years"" but was, ""Probably a million years."" Some people I know think it is.

>> I never do this. But some interpretations are just so obviously wrong that I felt the ridiculous need to correct them.   It's ridiculous, I know. But whatever. Here it is:

Blue jeans, White shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn

>> This is not a ""negative,"" as one commentator suggested. She's saying that he was so awesome that the aura around him was blinding.

It was like James Dean, for sure
You so fresh to death & sick as ca-cancer

>> Also, this is not a negative, either.  In hip-hop slang, ""sick"" is the same thing as saying ""dope"" or ""ill."" It means that person/thing is cool/awesome.

Big dreams, gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like: ""no please, stay here,""
We don't need no money we can make it all work
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waitin', anticipatin' and pacin' but he was
Chasing paper
""Caught up in the game"" that was the last I heard

>> Again, that commentator who thought ""chasing paper"" meant getting an MBA, is wrong. In hiphop, Chasing paper usually means getting caught up in something illicit because you'll probably get easy money out of it. Usually this means selling drugs. It's also called the drug game. He got caught in the drug game. 

You went out every night
And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
Cause Ima ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well shit, at least you tried.

>> The whole song, in the chorus too, she's describing that she would have done anything to have kept him. In the first half of this verse she seems to acknowledge that he tried, but in the next few lines, she obviously feels that wasn't enough. 

But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more-but that not what I had in mind

>> She didn't mean she wanted more money, but that's how he took it and so he got caught in that aforementioned ""game.""

I just want it like before
We were dancin' all night

>> This is what she meant by ""more."" She wanted to go back to how it was.

Then they took you away- stole you out of my life

>> ""They"" could mean other drug slingers, maybe he died in a turf war or something. But I think it could also mean he went to prison, and ""they"" mean the police; or maybe ""they"" are not cops, but the people who lured him to sell drugs in the first place.  The way she sings the chorus sounds like she hopes he's still alive and she's waiting for him. 

Will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years

>> wait to get out of prison, maybe? Or stop selling drugs? 

>> Lana said this song was part of a trilogy: Video Games, Blue Jeans, Born to Die.   It makes sense that he's not dead if there's another part of it. It also makes sense if he is dead though - just have to read Born to Die in a different way (which is pretty easy)! :D

			""This is not a ""negative,"" as one commentator suggested.""

Excuse me, I said it had ""negative undertones"", which means something different.

Are you saying metaphors that involve references to cancer, burning and death are completely positive? Or don't show contain sort of negative undertone, that is separate from their surface-level meaning? 

""Also, this is not a negative, either. In hip-hop slang, ""sick"" is the same thing as saying ""dope"" or ""ill."" It means that person/thing is cool/awesome.""

Of course ""sick"" is slang, that's incredibly obvious, we're not all from the 18th century. She linked it back to cancer because she's being ironic, and is probably commenting on the origin of the word. She does the same thing with ""fresh to death"", which is pretty paradoxical. 

All her compliments on him use imagery that is negative, but is reshaped into something positive. Which points to the fact that there is underlying negativity, on at least a subconscious level.

Your interpretation of these lyrics are incredibly shallow. Even though I'm not a fan of Lana Del Rey, I understand that her lyrics aren't just ""hip"" ways of expressing that ""you are the best, you're awesome!"" and nothing more.

			Okay so my friend knows Lana and was pretty close to her.

""Big dreams, gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like: ""no please, stay here,""
We don't need no money we can make it all work"" 

The song is legitimately about this guy she was in love with, the dudes name is Rob. He was into heroine or something (dealing it/using it) and one day he traveled to Alaska for some reason or another.

""But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waitin', anticipatin' and pacin' but he was
Chasing paper
Caught up in the game"" that was the last I heard""

Caught up in the heroine game that is. While the guy was there in Alaksa he overdosed. The news spread to all his friends but after a day or two Lana still had no idea and MY friend was the one who found out and called Lana on the phone to tell her the news. Lana then wrote the song sometime between then and January 15 when she performed it live for the first time on Saturday Night Live (She was pretty messed up with alcohol and what not thats why the performance was so ehh.) 

""You went out every night
And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
Cause Ima ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well shit, at least you tried.""

At least he tried right?

149,Blue Moon.json,"
The lyrics are presumed to refer to an English idiomatic expression: a blue moon is either the second full moon in a month or the third one when four full moons occur in one season of the year, which is a somewhat rare occurrence. If something happens ""once in a blue moon"" it happens almost never. The narrator of the song is relating a stroke of luck so unlikely that it must have taken place under a blue moon.

Just to me a cool cool song in the C Am Dm G7 mode of the fifties.  But also thot blue moon had something to do with volcanic ash in the 1900's obscurring the moon and making it blue-- making that a very very rare ocurrence.  SOng is cool when redone in the sixites mode.  Jazz interp is cool too for a different rendition.

This is 1 of the first rock n roll songs ever recorded. First done by Carl Perkins, then Elvis, then the Beatles, Johnny Cash, and followed by 6 others.

The first 2 lines are based on a classic children's rhyme. Elvis recorded his version of this song in 1956, waiting until his friend Perkins' version had left the charts.

It's 100% about anal sex.

""Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats""
- Now they put it in the butt.

""Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed""
- He sees her curvy body from behind and keeps his eyes closed while banging

""I know every curve like the back of my hand""
- He knows the feels because they do it often

""Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'mma take it slow just as fast as I can""
- He's doing it slow, just as fast as he can handle it, or as fast as she'll allow him to, but he doesn't care cuz he prefers it

""Ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets""
- It's not the same in the vagina

""Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile""
- They have to do it slow so every inch takes a long time: similar to the lyrics in Maynard's Dick by Tool (""Slide a mile six inches at a time on Maynard's dick"")

etc...
def about anal. I can't be the only one who thinks this.

"
154,Bohemian Rhapsody.json,"
Want my overanalyzed take?  It's pretentious, silly and yes, overanalyzed, and completely destroys the entire song!  It turns a cool song into another piece of dirt and manages to be glaringly wrong in the way!

Okay, let's make it the classic stages of acceptance after a shock.  He just killed someone.  Duh.  It's in the lyrics.

First comes shock.  Note the 'is this the real life / is this just fantasy' it opens with and the dreamlike tune it's in.

(from this point on, it's all within his head.  All of it.)

Note also the 'I need no sympathy' melodramatic nobleness he takes on in a play to get sympathy.  

He comes back to the world, and immediately tries to turn to the childhood source of sympathy, his mother.  He tries again to act like a hero, telling her 'nothing really matters' (in his mind, of course.  it's all in his mind.)

The chill of what he has just done rips across him, and at the first glimpse of pain he immediately goes into the classic 'I wish I was never born!'-type complete theatrical show, hoping once again for sympathy.

Now comes the weird (albeit exceedingly cool) part. 

The trial.

First his 'judges' (representing the severity and harsh reality of the consequences) come forth, half-threatening him with taunts of ""scaramouche / scaramouche / will you do the Fandango"" (it's defined above)

He crumples, first expressing shock.  Then, he twists his earlier defeated hero's claims to say ""I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me"" in a direct appeal to reality.

His other side, however, rushes in to try to save him from himself, begging the judges to release him.

He appeals, and is rejected.

His consul appeals several times in turn to allow him to stay in his own dreamlike state of deconnectedness.

The judges continue to strike down his pleas, growing more and more forceful, until he finally realizes that he has lost.  First is a generic ""well, I lost.  I'm going to hell, and I've got a demon with my name on it"" first realization.

Then comes the anger phase.  He strikes back at the world and himself with guitars in the background (note the playing of a much stronger version of the theme from the opening ""mama"" part) .  He then tries to escape outright, claiming he's ""just gotta get out / just gotta get right out of here"".

However, after a crecendo, he realizes that he's not about to win anything or survive anything, so he simply resigns.  It's very similar to the opening sequence--although instead of a dream, he seems much more lucid in this state.  He repeats much of what he's said earlier, only now he either believes it or has no choice but to accept it.

There.  I think it's an interpretation of the process gone through after a shock.  It's quite obviously wrong, but I can't help but thinking it.  

Besides, it's my favorite song.  Let me warp it however I want ;)

			speaking of overanalyzed takes... 
I just thought I'd give you mine :)

There's something very fantasy-like in this song, be it the music, the lyrics or the ups and downs.
Maybe it's the training on drug prevention I just took, but I have a feeling it's about a battle with drugs.

""Mama, life has just begun 
But now I've gone and thrown it all away""
He may be talking about how he's thrown his life away by using drugs.
He says: ""I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves, from a poor family"" as if it's his reason for using (ie: a bad, unloved boy from a bad family)

""Sends shivers down my spine 
Body's aching all the time""
which are real important side effects from drug use

""Mama, oooooooh (Anyway the wind blows) 
I don't want to die 
Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all""
notice how he keeps calling out to his mother, as if he desperately needs her attention/love/forgiveness. He goes through phases in the song where he regrets his life, then phases where he regrets the ups and downs and withdrawal times.

""I see a little silhouetto of a man 
Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango 
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me""
Hallucinations? Bad trips?
it seems real plausible, to me at least.
Then from the high pitched melody to real slow and down :
""I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me 
He's just a poor boy from a poor family 
Spare him his life from this monstrosity""


Then comes the part with all the prayers and such:
""Easy come, easy go, will you let me go? 
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go 
Let him go""
Notice how ""Bismillah! we will not let you go"" with the deep, ""manly"" voices are very devil-like and the other side saying ""let him go"". As if drugs (=bad) want him to keep using and prayer (=good (because of the calm, angelic voices)) want him to be free from drugs.

And now comes the part where he takes everything back into his own control:
""So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye 
So you think you can love me and leave me to die 
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby 
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here""

""stone me"" speaks for itself
""love me and leave me to die"" as in make me feel good but at the same time be killing me

And finally he goes into the numbness stage saying ""nothing really matters to me""

I don't know if it's plausible or makes sense at all but the highs and downs and melody changes and voice changes and all just make me think of the different states of mind drug users go through when using and after the highs or lows of different drugs.
And the presence of the mother is a cry for help or attention he may not have gotten from his ""poor family"" and which was the primary reason for his substance use.

Let me know what you think, though.

Cheers

			Yo ure all wrong, you speak as if the lyrics speaks for themselves. Freddie stated in an interview he had 3 songs writing at the same ttime, couldn't finish one so he played with it & put all 3 together & CREATED this song.  True???? Idk I heard him say that..his life, his way/meaning of the song. Hell, who knows, maybe has NO meaning. But to put that song in so many different types of ""music"" or sounds of music is brilliant & amazing. The man was given many talents & he used em fully 100%. Personally, I agree to an extent hearing from his personal assistant & cpl others who knew him think it was a way for him to ""come out w/his sexuality"" but the song is from mid '70's, I don't think he yet told gf Mary about his probable sexuality then. They met in very early 70's, song was out '75.they were together 6-7 ys before he told her. Time/dates don't add up. Seeing/following him, seeing & admiring him numerous talents esp song writing, I think a lot of his songs have some to do w/his life in many ways. He's a god to me. Now a days, Queen still f n rocks & Adam in my new found god. Very close to Freddie but I refuse to ever ""compare"" ANYTHING in life.

""Bismillah"" is the opening word in the Qu'ran (Koran) and literally means ""In the name of Allah.""
""Scaramouch"" according to the dictionary means ""a stock character who appears as a boastful coward.""
""Beelzebub"" is one of the many names given to the Devil (yes, it is spelled this way-not as above).
""Fandango"" is a Spanish dance done in triple time.

Fandango is traditionally danced with opposite sexes, the girl being asked by the boy to dance. In Basque culture, traditional dancing is valued greatly, and it is seen as very appealing, and masculine for a man to be a dancer.

""God"" is a title, not a name!			

@askewchan A Scaramouche is a clown in Italian opera.

I believe that this song is about someone that she is romantically interested in that she knows isn't right or knows that things aren't going to work with, and she knows an end is inevitable (born to die) but she ignores that because she wants to live and be happy with him while she can.

I think this song has multiple themes. 

The obvious meaning is that the end result of life is always going to be death, so we need to enjoy the ride  We need to love, live, get high (boo ya), and live each day like it is your last. 

The other meaning I am seeing is questioning the possibility of heaven and a creator.  Is it by mistake or design?  Is talking about the possibility of a god or are we a mistake.  And, in the end she comes to terms with not knowing the answer to this question. 

Based on the religious theme (church, cross in the car and around her neck etc.)  I think she is rebelling against religion.  She now can see clearly that she was seeking god because of her confusion and being scared she couldn't find all the answers.  But, now she has come to terms with not knowing all the answers in life so she is just going to enjoy life.  

""I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tryin' to take what I could get,
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers"" 

In the end, weather you are religious or not, no one knows all the answers and we need to live this life to the fullest because it is the only one we KNOW we have.

			hm, but I think, she wouldn`t wear a cross around the neck if she would ""rebell against church"". ;) And the phrase ""once I WAS blind""  doesn`t really fit in in your interpretation. Also, if you  believe in god or not, it  influences your comprehension of ""fullest live"", and how you like to live. :)

I've just stumbled across this song and it's blown me away.  It's almost haunting; its that youthful love that for most us fell between the cracks, of which you now only catch nostalgic glimpses when songs like this come about.

Anyway, I'm surprised AlikaReine had a -1; her explanation was very good, although perhaps you need to watch the music video to appreciate it.  I think AlikaReine's done a fantastic analysis so I want to expand on that - based on the music video's representation.

The song in my opinion is about wild romance and true love, heartache, loss, and growing up, underpinned by the opening line that set's the scene as her having already lost; journeying the road to recovery and reminiscing on the journey they travelled together (and that she desperately wants to turn back to).

-- this will definitely be long, so if you don't want to read a detailed analysis recommend stopping here.  if you do read please share your thoughts --

I've studied film and music video's for over a decade and I have to say this music video is one of the best I've seen in years.  The video is so well put together I must conclude the director worked very closely with the artist to replicate meaning of this song through moving image.

About the video:  The video is strongly metaphorical and the connotations are pleasantly obvious.  There is a basic narrative theory called Todorov's Theory that runs through this video, the basic outline of this is:  Equilibrium, Disruption, Recognition of the disorder, attempt to repair, leading to Equilibrium once more (5 stages).  Watch most films and you'll see it, it's the fabric of films that determines whether you leave the experience feeling closure and happiness, or discomfort and lack of closure.  Interestingly, the video places ""the lovers' [American] dream"" before and after the Equilibrium which emphasises its perpetual presence, as well as possibly highlighting it as a memory/vision.

As I already noted the song opens with her pushing ahead with life but experiencing pain and loss over the decision she's had to make.  When you've truly loved and lost, that person keeps returning to your thoughts and I know I've also repeatedly felt as though I hope we end up together again one day; ""But I’m hoping at the gates, They’ll tell me that you’re mine"" i.e. in the end we'll be together forever - ""the gates"" a reference to heaven.

The symbolism in the Catholic church is open to interpretation, in my view it relates to the stereotyping of a 'good, moral girl' i.e. a good upbringing and a traditional foundation.  Being a representation of her moral foundation also serves as a representation of her home which based on the stereotype was likely stable.  This is contrasted by his stereotypically ""rebellious"" image, which suggests his was likely dysfunctional.  It's also important to note she's much more 'dressed' in this shot, the relevance of this is the next scene and second verse.

The second verse and the chorus is about her adolescence to love and relationship.  Everything she was she gave up for this man, she changed her image, her style, her moral standpoint, and even left home to pursue this journey with him - a metaphor to emphasise sacrificing everything.  She believes it'll be home if she gives herself to him ""Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you’re mine"" - remember, this is her reminiscing on how she was, not how she is.  It's interesting she says ""if I tell you you're mine"" as one would usually say ""I'm yours.""  She may have written it this way to show her naivety, as well as the possibility she had to tell herself he was hers because he never did.

In the hook she sings the same as the verses and it's clear she's singing from her point of view.  However, there is a distinct separation in her singing style in the chorus to everything else, which connotes she is reflecting on what ""he"" was like; 'walking on the wild side, kissing hard in the pouring rain (i.e. passionate) and insane - the way he also wanted his partner to be, like him, which is why she changed.

Verse three she reminisces from a mature perspective about how naive she had been in the way she thought and felt; trying to take what she could get by changing who she was, because she was scared if she didn't he wouldn't want her and it'd just be her, alone.

The song and video go together so well and tell the complete story.  Driving the car being the metaphorical journey they travelled together.  You see him making the first sexual and drug oriented moves which suggests he was the dominant influence on her.

The crash is a powerful image and represents the end to their relationship; it killed her to leave, she was the one left bleeding, broken and bruised.  You see he's injured too but his is mild in comparison, his suffering begins at the point of her metaphorical death; when he must carry the knowledge it was him that ripped her to pieces and destroyed her, and all he is left with is darkness and flames.  There is also a much milder, unintentional undertone of realisation that he must know it's her that's moving on and getting better having 'gone on to the next life'.

This song is so heartwrenching. I think it's just about spending your time, especially your last days, with the one you love. It's about living while being alive.

In the music video, her facial expressions when she first sings ""sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough, I don't know why,"" are so sad and genuine it makes me want to cry. 

I am absolutely in love with Lana and I can't wait to see/hear more!

“Born To Die” is an amazing song. The first time I heard the song I was convinced that it would become one my favorites and it did!

I think the song has more than only one meaning. For me the song is about a relationship that was never meant to last. Lana sings “You and I, we were born to die” which I think refers to the relationship and not to Jesus and religion.

I once had a sexual-based relationship to a guy. But I fell in love with him, and our relationship would never last. When I heard the song I just felt like the song was wrote to describe him and me. Especially when Lana sings, “Sometimes love is not enough, and the road gets tough, I don't know why” it all makes sense to me. And when she asks, “Is it by mistake or design” I think the meaning behind is that she is wondering if there’s a concrete meaning behind why she should end up in that situation. Was it planed or was it a mistake?

It’s hard to describe my thoughts about the song in English when I’m from Denmark, but I hope you can see what I mean.

And one last thing: I love when she changes “Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain” to “Let me fuck you hard in the pouring rain”.

I sometimes wish to live like this:
""Talks to her family now and then
Through e-mails and postcards
She tries to explain to them
That education and occupation will have to wait for now""
But then again I would feel guilty for not working hard (and neglecting my future). I know the girl in this song is happy and she'll probably have a great future, but I know it's not for me - maybe when I'm done with education and occupation.

If you want to. Take my virginity. I should have said it before… i tried to hide the urge. Faked the orgasms.  I cant pretend it anymore. I only want to die like this. Never by the hands of a past relationship. I don't want to hear you lie tonight now that we have done this. This is when i want it so bad to happen. I'm in control and stronger. This is when I orgasm. Because nobody can resist this. You went better and deeper. I was on runners high. It hurt baby. This is sin so when we die we are going straight to hell. *moan*. I want to die like this. Never by the hands of an ex. I dont want to hear you lie tonight. Now that ive cummed. This is when i want it but hide it. Im in control. *orgasm* I cant resist it. No more baby ooh. Im sore. Thoughts on your body? You made me alive. You were lethal and made me almost die. In my dreams it felt so damn right but I woke up everytime. This is real. Im on the edge again. Bam. I have to stop now im sore.

this is and can't live without you are my two favorite songs out right now because i'm in a long distance relationship, my boyfriend lives in england and i live in maryland and i only get to see him 3 times a year and phone him once every 3 weeks. we met down in the bahamas and really hit it off, like we had so much in common and so did our parents. we went to the movies twice and our families went out to dinner together twice. we had a BLAST. well now that it's over i'm really having a hard time moving on and knowing that i can't see him once a week and i cry myself to sleep every night just thinking about our memories together. so my friends that really don't understand this whole lond distance thing ask me how i'm feeling and if i miss him and that stuff just to make conversation and i say ""yea i miss him but no big deal"" because if i told them how i really felt then they'd be like your too young to feel that way. so when i'm with my friends i hold in the tears and i'm slowly losing my mind and dying of depression and not one of them have any idea. i love you ben!

One of my favourites, and I do like Mariah a lot. Reminds me of the time I started to listen to it, after making love with the dearest friend of mine, and realising that it was more for me than just a one night stand, but not for him...so I kept on acting like it meant nothing, but I never quite got to be the same towards him, since I'm still broken about it, but nobody knows it.
I hear this song and tears flow from my eyes instantly. ""And I'm going the extremes to prove I'm fine without you, but in reality I'm slowly loosing my my mind, underneath the guise of a smile gradually I'm dying inside, friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly, 'cause I don't want to reveal that fact that I'm suffering...""

Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal that fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights and then break down and cry

Verse

So what do you do when somebody you're devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you and it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride and sing ""I will survive""
Do you lash out and say: ""How dare you leave this way""
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away

One of the hardest battles an individual can face in life, is the battle with oneself. Grande discusses this in 'Breathin', pointing out the most difficult of mental illnesses-anxiety.
As someone who suffers with severe anxiety, and other mental health problems, I get what Ariana was aiming for here. In the wake of the tragic Manchester Arena attacks in 2017, not to mention her personal life regarding her romances, she tells a story of wanting to take a moment and pause. 
'Breathin' is about collecting yourself, understanding that you can find stable ground when the world is falling apart. Realising that you can go back to happier place and reflect on that, and to finally understand that there are certain things in this world that we cannot control, so we have to let go and continue on with the life we have.

I never really listened to the lyrics of this song until recently. Funny how when you are going through something similiar, the words stick out to you moreso than before.

My take on the song is that she is in love with him but he is only using her/playing her. He knows that no matter how many times he hurts her, she loves him, therefore she will always be there when it's convienent for him. She knows it's wrong to love him and be with him but she just wants him so bad that she feels it's not wrong enough for her to leave. You get me?? It's like, you know that eating a whole bad of dorittos or a whole gallon of ben & jerrys is bad for you and the scale will probably read 5 pounds more in the morning, but you eat it anyway because you just want them/it so bad. It's almost like you'd rather have the little bit of him that he's willing to give you and a side of hurt to go than nothing at all.

Love it!

I also have a question all you guys that have seen the video (awesome vid) I was wondering if they knew why there are so many of her like in the first part of the vid when she is in the bathroom and she is looking in the mirrow and than another figure of her self shows up by the door. Same thing in the bed room scene, and when she is leaving.

Also do you think at the end of the vid when she is whipeing off the ""I'm Sorry"" is that from the guy the is singing about?

It's about a love that brings you down instead of raises you up.  She is struggling with getting away from it, but by letting herself be brought down her heart will be broken.  Getting over love, real love is hard.  Even though she knows it's wrong she lets herself get hurt by it.

Like a pillow, she's there for conveiniance ... something that's always lying around but not always used.

But then again also in the secong half she is speaking to that someone who broke her heart

By the lyrics and my personal view point, I believe that this song is specifically about a teenage girl who's parents are fighting/going through a divorce/in an abusive relationship. From the lyrics ""Sharp words like knives, they were cutting her down"" can show that her parents were also abusing her by yelling at her. I believe this song is showing how it is affecting her mental state and how she acts around other people. I believe that this is making her feel isolated, from not just her family, but herself as well. The ending to me feels like she yells at them or something and then tries to commit suicide.

Lyrically and musically, this is one of Mariah's best-written songs.  It is probably inspired by her divorce, which left her both sad because she really loved her husband, and relieved that she was finally doing the right thing by breaking away from a time in her life that she described as ""the height of her unhappiness"".

@EyesOnly I totally agree. one of her best written songs. 			

You know that saying..if you truely love someone, you will do what's best for them, even if it's letting them go....that's exactly what this song's about. I guess sometimes if you can't do anything to make the one you love happy, then all you can do is let them go, ""if you should return to me, we truely were meant to be"", is a hope to wait on, because that's all you can do is wait if your love is looking everywhere except at you.

This song has 2 meanings..the first one is pretty self explainitory about if u lose a love and if it returns its meant to be..but theres another meaning not many people know...its about her finally free from tommy matolla her ex husband. he was very controlling of her when they were married. the divorce to her was a blessing.

i love mariah's music. one of the prettiest thing about her lyrics is that they are easy to understand. very direct. she says exactly what she wants to get across without using all sorts of metaphors and allegories and things like that. BUT it still took me like 4 years to REALLY understand what she's singing about. probably because i was going through this painful time when i had to ""let someone go"". i was just sitting in the car listening to the song and at that point i totally appreciated what she was saying. but you know what... my butterfly came back to me. I really love this song.

This song is so truthful to everybody. Recently I experienced my first death I've ever gone through and it was somebody I was very close to. My grandfather was very sick and kept so strong just to be able to spend a few more months with us. He was an amazing person and this song puts me into tears because it's so true. I love Mariah Carey and even though most of her songs touch heart, everybody who's ever lost a loved one will absorb this song greatly. I heard this song on the radio and have been looking for it since. It's absolutely phenominal. It's not like an uplifting death song but it shows the true emotions to loosing a loved one. All you want to do is just have one more moment with them, but in the end you have to say good bye... and it's the hardest thing ever.

			I agree so much.  I can relate to this song and your story.  I lost my father just recently after he had been sick for many years.  I took care of him and tried to maintain his health and his LIFE.  But, eventually he couldn't hold on anymore and it hurt so much.  I am so sorry to hear about your grandfather. GOD BLESS HIM AND YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.  MAY HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE.  The entire song touches me.  But, when Mariah sings ""I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever. It's so hard to accept the fact that you're gone forever"" is so touching a true. I also love when she sings ""I never knew I could hurt like this.  Everyday life goes on I wish I could talk to you for a while.""  I love this song and I'm glad there are still heartfelt songs out there and not all shallow lyrics and songs.

I love this song.Although I have not going through the death of someone close to me,I have lost people in my life like my best friend.We haven't talked in months but no one knows how sad I am because I keep it inside.I guess the song could also be about losing someone just in your life.Like someone moving away or something.

THOUGHTS GOING OUT TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOST SOMEONE!

i think someone told her exactly what is going on in my life right now, this song is eerily similar to what's happening to me.  my grandma died this christmas day and my favorite uncle 2 wks later.  ""you never got the chance to see how good I’ve done... you never got to see me back at number one"" i've done horribly my past 3 yrs of college and she always told me she knew i could do it even till the end this semester i got a 4.0 and she never got to see it.  every single line in this song pertains to me, it's so weird and it came along at the perfect time.  i didn't really care for mariah carey that much until this song and the timing is perfect.  i'm sure everone can relate to this song or will at some point in their life.
""I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together"".  i can't even talk about this song without tearing up.  it is AMAZING.  and her voice is so pretty it makes it so much better.  ""I thought you were so strong
That you can make it through whatever
It’s so hard to accept the fact you’re gone forever"" ugh. every single line in this song even by itself is so meaningful.  this is my new favorite song.  I play it to everyone I know that hasn't heard it.  *sigh*

			I agree and I can relate.  For me, this song didn't come along at perfect timing.  But once I did hear it, it helped to know that someone else could feel my pain and had felt it before and decided to write and express it.  I hope you are blessed and that your loved ones rest in peace.  I can understand because I recently lost my beloved father near the holidays.  This song explains my hurt and pain that I don't always express to people.  It hurt even more to know that is was my senior year and he didn't get to seem me graduate or attend prom so I definitely know the pain.  I had to go to school and struggle and make the best of it even though I didn't have my father to see all I have accomplished.

I love this song!  This song I can never get sick of.  The meaning I can relate to so well:
""Charlie really likes his friends
But in his heart he knows that sometimes a dog is as good as any man
Trying to do as we should
That doesn't always rhyme with doing what feels good""
I love it, your friends aren't always what they seem, and sometime you just need someone/something to listen or to be alone.  This song does that for me.  I crank this song in my dorm when Im alone and close my eyes, just zone out of life and into the amazing music and lyrics.
My favorite part, besides the guitar/piano solo in here is:
""But you can sit in the grass it feels good
You don't even need to think a word
You don't have to worry, don't worry""

Man, that is exactly how I try to live, and how I think summer should be.  Kickin it with friends, some beer and some good tunes.  WSP is one of the best bands to enter my CD player.

jeff riley, an old dorm buddy of mikey came up with the idea with some late night influences.  mikey and jeff played around w/ it and here you go....  a song about life about a kid that didn't fit the normal mold.  Charlie, loves his friends....  friends watch him fall and laugh (football kick).  he finds that he can find his happiness with his good old puppy....  and sometimes just sit in the green, green and enjoy himself....  whatever feels good.  

now the sketching lucy on the run gets a bit complex.  2 theories.  

1.  charlie schultz, created and can erase lucy with a simple strike of an eraser.  and in a cloud of dust from the eraser on the old black board lucy is out of the picture.
2.  charlie (brown) sketches her in a different way...""charlie draws a gun, and sketches out lucy on the run....and bang, cloud of dust old lucys gone.?

To me, this song is about child bullying.  Charlie is a ""naive"" child and is picked on by all the other kids that he believes are his friends.  The only person that really listens to him is his dog.  Fed up with the bullying, he shoots Lucy.  Sounds like the outcome of a lot of bullying in schools these days.....

its a shame cuz the guy actually can rap and write lyrics that actually mean something like the first line:

pussy my passion - staying away from the spotlight, hes unknown
never been a fan of flashing - cameras, lights, etc. again he stays away from the spotlight..

but the shame is that he clearly has that lupe-like ability to make double meanings and good lyrics but like mainstream rap hes talking about having sex, getting head, all that shit..

If he didnt rap about that and have those fucked up lyrics he would be one of my favorite rappers but damnnn clearly hes probably gonna be famous and people will overlook his crappy lyrics.

My mom used to sing this song to me when I was younger, so I agree with LMB228 about how it can be a universal song of affection rather than just for lovers. Its such a sweet song in the sense that its stated so simply, but so perfectly...the meaning is so clear, yet so profound: you don't find love, love finds you, and you have basically no choice but to accept it, whether it will end up being your death or or your life. Such a glorious song, I'm no huge Elvis fan, this is the only song I like by him, but still, its one of the best songs ever.

This was me and my last boyfriend's song. We were in his room, and I told him we needed a song. He said that the next song that came on the radio would be ""our song,"" and this is what came next. Too perfect. It was ironic, too, because he told me he had feelings for me about six months before we got together. He had just broken up with a friend of mine and I just kept telling him he was rushing into something he wasn't ready for. But we ended up together. He was the best boyfriend I ever had, and everytime I hear this song, I think of how much we used to love each other. It is the perfect love song.

@CaptiveL As Keith and others note, it's both literal and a metaphor. And as metaphors go, I think this one is unusually brilliant. Unlike just about every other component of a car, the radio serves no functional purpose -- it is solely there to entertain and provide distraction from the tedium of driving. And if it gets stolen, it leaves an empty slot in the dash, and one must then drive in silence. Metaphorically, the car is his life, and the radio was something that provided distraction. But now that something is gone, leaving a hole in his life, and freeing his mind to think thoughts both deep (""something great"") and depressing (""something terrifying"").

One recurring thought involves refilling the hole in his life by going back to the old distraction (""replace that slot with what I once bought""). This is suggestive of an addiction of some sort, but it doesn't have to be.

But the ultimate message of the song involves ""the things we can do"" about our lives, of which ""there are only two"" that matter: we can choose ""faith"" or ""sleep,"" which he goes on to develop as life vs death, being full of life and thinking vs being mindless or even literally dead (suicide). We can pay attention and drive the car safely, or we can ""pull the steering wheel"" and crash it. The plea is for faith = life = thought, a similar message to ""Holding on to You"".

""Joseph said that while he was going to college to major in Communications (or in his words, a fancy way of saying undecided), he pulled his “horribly beat up car to the place” where he’s “supposed to learn for thousands of dollars” and because he was late, didn’t lock the door. As one might suspect, when Joseph left class his car was gutted with his CD Player, GPS, and car radio stolen.
“And because I’m super emo and all about looking for inspiration, I wrote a song about that moment.”
Joseph said that sans car radio, he had more time to be introspective. “That song kind of just documents where you let your mind go when you don’t have a distraction to keep it in its box.”

like me, don't want to see all
the things I've seen""
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'
She says, ""You don't want to
get this way, famous and dumb
at an early age""
Lyin', I'm lyin'

The boys, the girls,
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes

She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lighting
White lightning

Carmen, Carmen
Staying up till morning
Only 17 but she walks the
streets so mean
It's alarming truly
How disarming you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream
Coney Island queen

She says, ""You don't want to
be like me, lookin' for fun,
gettin' high for free""
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'
She says, ""You don't want to
get this way, street walk at
night and a star by day""
It's tirin', tirin'

The boys, the girls,
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes

She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lighting
White lightning

Baby's all dressed up with
nowhere to go
That's the little story of the
girl you know
Relying on the kindness of 
strangers
Tying cherry knots
Smiling, doing party favours
Put your red dress on, put your
lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the
camera's on
And you're alive again

The boys, the girls,
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes

She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lighting
White lightning

Darlin', Darlin'
Doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself
Cos her liquor's top shelf

			I believe it's ""sing your swan song"" not ""sing your song song."" Otherwise your corrections seem to be spot on!			






			I believe it's ""sing your swan song"" not ""sing your song song."" Otherwise your corrections seem to be spot on!			

This song is about Lana Del Rey before she became famous (Around her young adult years).
Carmen=Lana.

 ""Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem. Lying to herself cause her liquors top shelf."" She thinks that she's completely fine and that she has no addiction but in reality she's addicted to alcohol and needs help(Which Lana actually talked about before).

""It's alarming honestly how charming she can be, fooling everyone telling them she's having fun."" Everyone thinks how she's that girl who's never upset and how shes always having a good time when Lana actually feels depressed and sad about how bad her life has gotten.

""She says you don't wanna get this way, famous but dumb at an early age.""
Lana got addicted to alcohol at the age of 14(dumb at an early age), got sent to boarding school to fix her addiction, then she ran away and technically lived on the streets. Everyone knew who she was because she would do whatever she could for money even prostitute herself sometimes (which ill explain later).

""Buy her tonight, she's still shining like lighting.""
I think this is the part when she prostituted herself. She's saying how people should buy her for the night while she's there (can't really explain it, but it's pretty obvious).

""She says you don't wanna get this way, street walk at night but a star by day.""
This is another part when she talks about how she sold her self as a prostitute at a young age.

""Babys all dressed up with nowhere to go, that's the little story of the girl you know."" In this quote I feel like she's always looking for a party to go to and spend her time somewhere or the fact that she's walking on the streets all dressed up waiting for someone to buy her for the night.

""Relying on the kindness of strangers.""
She hopes that someone would be nice to her and help her get her life back on track or give her some money so she can support herself. It's like a perspective from a homeless person kind of thing. 


""Tying cherry knots smiling doing party favors. Put your red dress on, put your lip stick on."" 
Being able to tie a cherry stem into a knot is a sign of being a good kisser. Lana is saying how she's doing party favors probably such as hooking up with people and doing sexual acts or drugs for the money. Then she says how she's putting on her red dress and her lipstick, here she is saying how she's ready to go out and sell herself again or do whatever she can to get money.

""Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besion de moi
Tu as besion de moi dans ta vie 
Tu ne peux plus vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi.""
Translation: “My love, I know that you love me too.
You need me, you need me in﻿ your life.
You can’t live without me
And I’d die without you.
I’d kill for you.”
Here she is talking about her addiction to alcohol and how much she craves it in her life and how she can't live without it.

So long story short. This song is about Lana when she lived on the streets.

			its not. Its about her friend			






			its not. Its about her friend			

""The song about Carmen is not about a woman who is a prostitute. 

""Carmen"" is about a woman with an alcohol problem who is constantly attempting to convince herself the she truly has no problem at all and is truly just fine. ""Doesn't have a problem. Lying to herself, cuz her liquor's top shelf"". This line states that Carmen, who, truly, is Lana Del Rey in her teenage years, is crazy and an alcoholic but is convinced that she has no problem. She is lying to herself cuz her liquor is too high to reach or is high class and safe to drink.

""She's still shining like lightning...""
This line, however, does refer to a sort of prostitutional issue that she once had. Although she has screwed up millions of times, she still has potential to be a good person and is shining... 

It's all about Lana Del Rey as a teenager. Lana, in an interview, said that all the songs on the album reflect off of her troubled past, where she was making crazy decisions and living the life of a runaway drug addict. But it took her awhile to admit to herself that she needed help. But once she admitted to herself she had a problem, she got help and now is LIKE LIGHTNING!""

Carmen is a girl who is alcoholic (Lana obviously) but the symbol of Carmen through the song becomes a symbol of crystal meth or methamphetamine. You can see in the chorus, it's really simple. 
1. ""The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen'' - all her friends like and do meth
2. ""She gives them butterflies"" - meth helps the release of serotonin (a hormone contributor to well being and happiness)
3. ""Her mind's like a diamond"" - diamond = crystal
4. ""Like lighting, white lighting"" - obvious

If you watch the Carmen video closely, you can see that the some parts of the video show for a second how methamphetamine affects the central nervous system and the release of serotonin.

In my mind, this is without a doubt inspired by Blanche DuBois from ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" If you love this song and have never read the play, its not very long or time consuming and you will see a lot of connections. 

""Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem 
Lying to herself cause her liquor's top shelf 
It's alarming honestly how charming she can be 
Fooling everyone, telling how she's having fun""

In the play, Blanche suffers from some form of mental illness and drinks heavily, presumably to avoid the demons of her past. She charms and fools many people into thinking that she is something other than what she truly is. 

""She says you don't want to be like me 
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen 
I'm dying, I'm dying 
She says you don't want to get this way 
Famous, and dumb, and no age 
My, I'm dying""

Blanche reveals the demons of her past at various point throughout the play. Her family dying off in front of her eyes, the loss the family plantation, the suicide of her husband which she is convinced is her fault. She is portrayed as the most notorious person from her home in Laurel because of her sleeping around after the death of her husband, hence the ""famous, and dumb...."" line.  

""Baby's all dressed up, with nowhere to go 
That's the little story of the girl you know 
Relying on the kindness of strangers 
Time and cherry marks while doing party favours 
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on 
Sing your song, song, now, the camera's on 
And you're alive again ""

Blanche's clothing and jewelry are often spoken of throughout, as well as her enjoyment of wearing them. She truly does get dressed up with no where to go as she does not work, is seldom mentioned leaving Stella's, and can't leave New Orleans because she was run out of her home town and can't afford to support herself. ""I have always relied on the kindness of strangers"" is her last line in the play... This was what really sold me on the Blanche influence and made me examine the lyrics more closely. 

There are other small similarities that may be a stretch... the lines in French might be from Blanche speaking in French and talking of her French heritage. The mention of ""light"" and ""lightning""... Light, or lack there of, was important symbolism in the play for Blanche, and is mentioned in her most important and telling monologue (the one about her husband.)

@soccervol 















As you all know, Lana is a big Marilyn Monroe fan. I think that in this song she's talking about  her.
  ""Darlin', darlin' Doesn't have a problem Lyin' to herself Cos her liquor's top shelf"". ---Marilyn was not like ""the best person in world"", she had a lot of problems, and drinking can be one of them.
   ""It's alarming, honestly, How charming she can be, Fooling everyone, Telling them she's having fun"" --- Marilyn was, like, such a beautiful woman, also a great actress. But, she was in depression, even if she was the definition of perfection, in her time.
   ""She says, ""You don't want to be like me, don't want to see all the things I've seen"", I'm dyin', I' dyin'"" --- We all know that Marylin ""knew too much"", cause she was secretly the girlfriend of president.
   ""She says, ""You don't want to get this way, famous and dumb at an early age"", Lyin', I'm lyin'"" --- She became famous and made a lot of mistakes.
   ""The boys, the girls, They all like Carmen, She gives them butterflies, Bats her cartoon eyes"" --- everybody loved Marilyn,  she was a great actress, a beautiful woman and a sexy model.
   ""She laughs like God, Her mind's like a diamond, Audiotune lies, She's still shinin', Like lighting, White lightning"" --- at the end of her life, so much people was saying that she became a mess, but that was not true.
   ""Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go, That's the little story of the girl you know, Relying on the kindness of strangers, Tying cherry knots, Smiling, doing party favours, Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on, Sing your song, song, now the camera's on, And you're alive again"" --- I think that this part is the most representative, cause it's about her actress career and being a little sluty. She was acting and singing, and this is way everybody loved her. In the ""And you're alive again"" part, Lana is a little sarcastic, remaining that Marilyn is dead.
   THIS IS JUST MY OPINION, PLEASE DON'T JUDGE :)

Halsey isn't alone-- many women (famous or not) can relate to this song. She's headed straight for the castle (the top, the finish line, her goal, success, etc.) and there's an old guy trying to put her down. It's the stigma of a woman being successful and taking the place of/surpassing/dethroning a man. Women are often told to smile, look pretty, keep their mouth shut, etc. It's often not even noticed, as we're so used to it, but when we call them out on it, we're being bitchy. We're being mean. Well, she's had enough. She's headed straight for the castle.

I don't know.  I think maybe she's tired of the paparazi and the cut-throat business she's in (the music industry). She's working her way to the ""top"" of being famous, etc.  but to do so she's had to become a real B***,  to be real mean and cut-throat hersefl, in order to battle the producers and managers and record labels and paparazzi and everyone else around her.  

Ever watch ""Once Upon a Time""? Remember the evil queen's father?  I think the old man telling her not to be so mean is probably either her father or a father-like figure, trying to remind her to not be so mean, to try and be a little more normal or human, to be the good girl they know her to be.  She fought her way to the top and in the process changed and he's trying to tell her to not be so mean.  I think there are a lot of ""Diva's"" out there, who've become real B***'s, maybe because that's who they naturally are or because they've got so much money and power its corrupted them, etc. but either way...

Since the album is a concept album this would be one of the characters talking about their failed dreams. Since 'Paradise' is about the female character's loss of innocence and disillusionment with the world I would venture a guess that the male character's feeling of failure. Its towards the beginning of the album so setting up would seem right since its a story.

			I thought it was about the female character finally leaving her home full of ""failed dreams"" and trying to find the male character...			






			I thought it was about the female character finally leaving her home full of ""failed dreams"" and trying to find the male character...			

Well, since their album follows a love story, here is what I think. Hurts like Heaven was the beggining, and then it flashes back to Paradise and Charlie Brown. Paradise was about the girl leaving her home to discover herself, but all her dreams were never happening because the world is a cruel place. 

Charlie Brown is about the guy trying to make it through life before meeting her. IT starts in the beginning with him stealing a car and going downtown to do drugs with the ""lost boys"". The lights going down at the end of the scene are cop cars coming. They show up and he gets busted. It is like his ""scarecrow dreams"", bad dreams of people destroying everything he ever wanted (drugs are the scarecrows that destroyed his life). The rose part is probably either the girl encouraging him to got back up again, or some other form of moral support. Then the moral support goes on to say (no that i listen to it, it probably is the girl) to him that he should be a cartoon heart. Be like Charlie Brown, who is always getting picked on and nothing really works out for him. Always get back up again. Finally, the glow in the dark is for both of them to always be a positive light to all the boys and girls with all their problems. They went through all their troubles and they want to glow, be a light and show them how to get through it.

This is one of my favorite songs on their album.

What an amazing riff this song has!

I think it's a continuation of Paradise- the girl from the previous song escapes her life, ""flies away"" as she desired to, and meets up with a group of guys and hangs out with them. That's just going by the story of the album, though- taken out of context it could be about anyone who's traveling... I get the feeling it's sung from a male perspective, though I wouldn't know.

This song is amazing. Even if it's about a stolen scooter for me it's much more. It's about happiness, freedom, a good feeling... that smile that nobody can wipe away from your face; positive vibes. ""We'll be glowing in the dark"": Us being the light (good things) glowing (fighting) in the dark (bad things, evil). For me, it's the perfect song when I'm feeling down. I listen to it to forget about problems, to smile. It's one of my Coldplay's Top 5!

@MaryMaryQuiteContrary 















To me this song is about a dream that can't seem to come true; the music itself is a sense of desire. Think about the song title: Charlie Brown. If you've ever watched the old Charlie Brown shows then you know how Charlie Brown always had to settle for the short end of the stick, whether it was getting a rock for Halloween instead of candy or being tricked into kicking a football only to have it jerked away from him at the last second. To me this song symbolizes just those attributes. But this song is also very hopeful as Chris Martin encourages to ""Be the cartoon heart"". When I hear that line I think of the episode of Charlie Brown when all they had was a tiny Christmas tree and everyone was still happy - Cartoon heart. ""We'll be glowing in the dark"", this again provides the same message of having a hopeful heart. I love this song, when something goes wrong or I feel as though I'm on the short end of the stick in any situation, this is the perfect song. Music, lyrics, everything.

I think it's about how people who have questionable lifestyles, such as those of drug use or crime, don't see their actions the way everyone else does. While we see them using drugs, we would ""call it a spliff"", but to them, it ""smells like chocolate"". People never perceive their own actions to be as bad as they would perceive them to be if they saw someone else doing it, and I think that might be what this song is about.

In an interview, Matty says this song is about ""me and my mates knocking around in my hometown. It is a kind of love letter to the kind of relationships we had with authority figures, be it our parents or the police. its kind of a story about small town boredom."" 


To me, this song is a serenade or an ode of sorts to when a guy likes a girl and the time they spend together, just doing wild crazy teenager stuff. He believes life is sweet when their together ('chocolate') and he doesn't ever want them to break up or give up their time together ('quit it'). I tend to envision some cool teenagers having fun around town together when I hear this song. They don't want their time together to end ('quit'). They prefer to be youthful and rebellious and have a good time.

			I found your comment very interesting, and I went to look up exactly this to find out more details. I looked for wikipedia pages, biographies, and interviews with the band talking about he origin of this song and I couldn't find anything about his sister or the song being about heroine. I'm just curious, where did you get this idea? I'd love to read more about it.

This screams heroin to me... As a recovering opiate/opiod addict of over 3 years, I felt that way as soon as I heard it.

I've heard tar called chocolate, and needles as guns. Besides the slang terms used, what really caught my ear was when he says ""Hey now you say you're gunna' quit it but you're never gunna' quit it."" 

Heroin is literally the hardest drug habit to kick. I can't tell you how many times I've heard something similar come out of a friends mouth, over and over and over again.

@fexysox, your explanation is the best I've heard. The ""never gonna quit it"" line is especially convincing that the song is about heroin. Best wishes to you in your recovery.

Chocolate is another word for weed or pot. The boys in the blue are the ones that don't want to legalize weed. (Or the police officers) The ones in the black are the ones that want it legalized. They are hiding guns to protect themselves in case they get caught. They are never going to stop smoking it. They need to go somewhere where they won't get caught and everything smells like pot after they smoke it

@silentninja97 















It's about a bunch of friends who've been smoking ""chocolate"" (pot) in their car and are now being pursued by the cops (the boys in blue). I'm pretty sure the line is NOT ""bite your friend like chocolate"" but ""Oh your friends smell like chocolate"". The singer has a pretty strong accent, but I think it's more likely that smoking weed makes you smell like weed rather than bite people.

I think its about heroin . Sometimes heroin users buy a bar of chocolate for the tin foil inner wrapper to smoke the heroin .a roll of of tin foil in your car will alert the cops if they stop you. When you smoke ymthe heroin your car your car smells of chocolate . ( don't ask )  some of the band members look like user,s to me thin washy and pale

To me it resonates as being about doing everything you're not supposed to do. Chocolate is most definitely imagery for a drug (Probably pot) and the rest of it seems to narrate the finer points of a more edgy lifestyle.

			In the UK, the usual introduction to cannabis when you're a teenager is a cheap form of hashish known as ""soap bar"".  Full of impurities it usually comes in bars wrapped in cellophane that resemble a bar of soap, or indeed - due to its brown colour - chocolate.  Because it needs to be heated to be crumbled up, it tends to smell pretty significantly, so your best bet for having an undisturbed session is to walk or drive to an out-of-the-way location with your mates and have a smoke.  Of course, one of your mates will invariably light up in the car - and even if they don't you're going to reek of it when you drive back home, so it follows that the drive is going to be incredibly cautious in order to avoid attracting unwanted attention from ""the boys in the blue"".  This can be made more difficult if you've become a little paranoid from the effects of what you've just been smoking. :)

Anyway, I think that's what this is about - a paean to youthful indiscretions with cannabis.

This song has great lyrics and is a great cover for Panic.

Like in many panic songs, (see Rock, for one) the water is the all-consuming substance that surrounds and subdues you.  Here, it represents drug addiction.  Grabbing each other's collar and rising out of the water-- we need each other to clear get beyond this.  Stick your finger in the dike -- reference to old fable/story, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/….  

Another theme in Panic songs is addiction--Another thought--Panic apparently changes the lyrics from ""after all that I've been through"" to ""after all that I've been to.""  Makes me think of people beating their addictions by letting every thing else go, including other people, after all the shows they go to...  Panic never leaves you in the dark (the venue lights always turn back on) or on your own (surrounded by many others) - Of course, this is just the creation of another addiction.

@beowulf44 















I'd have to agree with everyone this is one of my all-time favorite Panic songs! 

I really love the train metaphor. A close to derailing train really captures the intensity of fighting addiction, especially one as difficult as heroin. ""Scream at the conductor, he's been deaf for 20 years"" is really the addicted yelling at the intrinsic ""self,"" as if he's having withdrawals and trying to scream to himself ""STOP,"" but as anyone who's fought an addiction knows, mind over matter isn't easy. His mind is no longer listening to him. Half wants heroin, the other wants, and is fighting, to quit the drug. His every gear grinds trying. 

The way I mentally picture the song is a man with a needle about to shoot-up but trying so hard to not (""close to impact""). I debate with myself, as to whether the line ""your reflective skin is fallin' off your bones"" is commenting on the agony of withdrawal or the transition between addict to cured. 

As beowulf44 stated, water is defiantly the personified antagonist of this work. Water represents the addiction and Panic, the group as a whole, are trying to facilitate a way away from the water.  ""We can walk on water, like junkies swore they did"" is an attempt at to easing the nerves, like saying ""you can do it!"" The junkies part confuses me a little, I'm not sure if it's referring to before they were junkies or if they're in denial. The line ""mind his business and roll along as usual"" is really ""i guess this business will roll along as usual,"" which matters because it changes the tone from apathy to repetition, once again showing how long and grueling fighting addiction is and how important dedication is. 

THIS SONG IS AMAZING as is WIDESPREAD PANIC!!!

@jamaway2flyaway 















I totally agree with jamaway, climb to safety is definatly about heroin. This is one of the best meaning panic songs to me. I over came opiate addiction the same way jerry joseph did, cold turkey. ""You scream at the conductor, He's been deaf for 20 years"" is most definatly your conscience saying stop but your body wont listen. Panic is a great band because they have that dark side. Songs like c2s mean a lot to people who have gone through those dark times as well. 
Detoxing of Heroin is no shit. Doctors say worst experiene besides Chemotherapy. I know Jamaaway said this but now listen to the lyrics again and picture yourself the way Jerry explains it.

210,Close My Eyes.json,nil
211,Closer (feat. Halsey).json,"
This song is about hooking up with your ex. It was written to be feel-good rather than full of regrets like most hook-up-with-your-ex songs are.

About the opening line Andrew Taggart says, ""I drink a lot. Most of my relationship issues come from drunk times.""

They used the setting of the ""hotel bar"" as a sort of nostalgic memory for that scenario to happen. It paints a vivid image of a girl at the bar and the rush of emotions that cones along with that.

The line ""we ain't ever getting older"" is meant to show the message of how nothing has changed between them. Andrew Taggart, a Syracuse grad, says that the girl in this song represents all of his exes from his university.

The Blink-182 song they are referring to is ""I Miss You,"" which Halsey did an impromptu cover of at one of her shows. The buys also covered it in their sets when they were just starting out.

Halsey has a rose tattooed on her shoulder which they refer to biting in the chorus. 

The idea for the duet came about in order to give the song more of a story line with some depth and characters with dialogue, because originally Andrew was just going to sing her verse.

@annehrt 















They meet in hotel bar because this is where the girl hangs out for work with her friends. She was a spoiled daddys girl in Boulder with life coming easy for her, but now she`s faced lives tough reality. The song writer bittersweetly dedicates this songs to ""all the girls in boulder"".

This easy life girls ends up working girl, and thus the boy doesnt want to see her friends again. These girls hang out and find their prey in the hotel bar drunk. You dont look pretty in hotel bar for nothing. The girl is either nostalgic of meeting him or in desperate need for money and thus starts sweet talking him about old songs etc.

In her line of work they end up at the back of the car owned by her employer the pimp. She doesnt have money for that type of car, and he notices it or even teases her about it. 

So they are both broken hearted to find her in that situation, and he specially down from her leaving him still.  He may have hidden sadistic pleasure of her having stepped so low as she was the one who broke up. She being the rich girl with easy life, and then ending up like this.

ShikamaruXXX I agree with you in some ways, but I also have to disagree.

It may be repetitive, but it's catchy and got a nice beat, which makes people money now a days.  It's also the fun thing to thump to in a car with a nice system, I mean, I listen to just about everything, but there's no way I'd listen to rock with subs, it sounds ridiculous, and serious rap/r&b is lacking catchy beats & repetitive lyrics, so it's not fun, while rap/r&b like this, is what sounds perfect with a nice system.

I'm sure you either think you're mr. pro listening to either like old rap that's all serious and shit, or you don't listen to hardly any rap and are very narrow minded.

so what? he's my cousin, sexy runs in the family

there's definitely a 'y' added to the end of everything so it rhymes with family. and a 'jammy' is gun so... yeah. Just my take on it. It's bugged me all summer and that's the closest I can get it to even making sense (at least the Britney stuff)

I love this song so very deeply.

The way Halsey manages to describe someone as ""devoid of color"" whilst making them out to be the most beautiful thing she's ever experienced is incredible. She acknowledges his flaws and the sadness that is his emptiness, yet still finds him to be a masterpiece. I don't think she's putting him on a pedestal - I think she truly does see him in a way no one else does, including himself.

It's heartbreaking. I cry each time I hear this song.

This is my absolute favorite song of hers. She's describing someone as a color, specifically blue throughout the song, mostly because blue is a cool, deep, passionate color, and then later refers to him as red, probably because red is fiery and deep. She's covered in him, the color he is, and he's made her into someone else and then decides that she isn't the right one for him.

I think this song can mean many things, when I first listened to it, I thought it was about suicide.

But then I listened more and more and it sounds like it's about how she sees how great he is.

@Slaven43 















This song seems to be a lot about a struggling relationship between two people while one of them is fighting an addiction. You can find a lot of drug references, even if unintentional: starting by giving a background of the other person's life (your little brother never tells you but he loves you so, and your mother only smiled on her TV show) maybe to give a reference as to why the person has resorted to drugs. Then stating the obvious : you're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope. 

Then it gives a hint to the ""club 27"" or the famous fact that many drug addict famous personalities die at 27 years old (""I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old"" meaning she hopes the person passes the mark). 

Then begins the less obvious references: ""you're dripping like a saturated sunrise"" this could be interpreted as a trip, specifically acid for the saturated sunrise part,  but maybe debatable.. 

I'm guessing when she says she's tearing through the pages and the ink, that she knows him/her deep down, on his/her darkest moments. 

Then on to the chorus are the more obvious references, talking about pills, smoke, and being blue and having grey dreams. Depression is a big factor amongst drug users as their serotonin receptors become messed up. It's usually a tipping point or the hardest to fight after the physical addiction has settled during withdrawals. 

Then what I get from the lillac sky part is that the person was was very passionate in the beginning because she was different from them. But as she became ""contaminated"" by the same mellow state within the drug abuse world, the other person lost interest. Drug users tend to seek very high states of mind to compare to the high the drugs give, otherwise they become ""bored"" and depression kicks in again.

Interesting lyrics.

Notice the use of the reference to the childhood game of Tag, ""No takebacks"", With this in mind the Come & Get It chorus of 'Na Na Na Na' could be interpreted as the childish taunt of 'Na Na Na Na'.

I just truly love this song!!!  A Booty call is the last thing that this song is about!.  No matter how much they disagreed or did not connect  in the relationship, he cannot stop thinking of her.  No matter what their problems are at the moment, lets put them to the side and forget about them for now, I just want you to be here with me.  He just wants to hold her in his arms.  No talking, no fighting, no pointing the finger....just be together for that sense of calm. SIMPLE NOT COMPLICATED Thats It !!  They don't have to end world hunger, or stress over the relationship...all that matters is we need to hold each other.  AND how true is the line,"" You can say we are done, the way you always do..it's easier to lie to me than to YOURSELF!  SO TRUE!!

No matter what their problems are at the moment, lets put them to the side and forget about them for now, I just want you to be here with me.  He just wants to hold her in his arms.  No talking, no fighting, no pointing the finger....just be together for that sense of calm. SIMPLE NOT COMPLICATED Thats It !!  They don't have to end world hunger, or stress over the relationship...all that matters is we need to hold each other.  AND how true is the line,"" You can say we are done, the way you always do..it's easier to lie to me than to YOURSELF!  SO TRUE!!  Next best line...Forget about your friends, you know they are gonna say we're bad for each another...BUT we aren't good for anyone else ( HELL lets face it)  I love it

Kenny Cheney said it's about a ""high class booty call."" It's not some random woman he wants just for sex. He did love her and feelings are still there, but he's just lonely. Having her there is a comforting on a dark night.

"
222,Come Together.json,"
The song is about the Beatles feeling towards eachother. during a weak time, George brought up the Yogi and the phrase ""Come Together right now over me"" is an excerpt from the script telling them to use this song to build their bonds again and unite as one.

Each verse is dedicated to a Beatle:

Verse 1: ""Here come old flattop, he come grooving up slowly
He got joo-joo eyeball, he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please""

This verse is obviously Ringo. Ringo's old school drum beats (""Flat top"" refering to the old hair cut in the mid 1900's) were off at first with the rest of the band, but in time he got better and better (""Groovin' up slowly""). ""he got hair down to his knee,"" is a joke about his shaggy look when he first joined the group and since he's sitting down playing the drums his hair wouldnt quite reach his knees but you get the riff. ""Got to be a joker he just do what he please,"" Refers to him being the goof of the quad-squad.

Verse 2: ""He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, ""I know you, you know me""
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
Come together right now over me""

Did someone say George? ""He wear no shoeshine,"" well lets face it, George wasnt fancy and liked the bare foot thing. ""He got toe-jam foot ball,"" Soccor was a sport usually practiced outside the temples where the Yogi was practiced. ""He got monkey finger,"" George was extreeeeeemly dextrous and learned many stringed instruments with ease. ""He say,' i know you, you know me'etc..."" another refrence to the Yogi.

Verse 3: ""He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease
Come together right now over me""

This is the most obvious one... give up? really??! It's John! Duh! ""he bad production,"" refers to john constantly would stopthe recordings and piss off all the rest of the band. ""He got walrus gumboot,"" John wrote 'I am the walrus"" and kept making songs like that and refused to change his style, thus upsetting the rest of the band. ""He got Ono sideboard,"" a side board is a court term refering to pulling to the side or distracting. Yoko Ono would pull John away from the band and Is believed to be the downfall of the band. ""he one spinal cracker,"" a term related to ""braking my back,"" John would constantly argue with the band mates adn ""brake thier backs."" ""He got feet down below his knee,"" John refused to be openminded or ""get on his knees""  He wass stubborn and stood up, refusing to kneel to anyone.
""Hold you in his arm chair you can feel his disease,"" Anyone who really knew John, or even got close to him, you knew something was wrong physically with him, depression, anger, etc. etc..

Verse 4:""He roller-coaster, he got early warning
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, ""One and one and one is three""
Got to be good-looking because he's so hard to see
Come together right now over me ""

Last but not least, Paul! ""He roller-coaster,"" Paul was very emotional and would change all the time on everything whether it be a song or feelings. ""He got early warning,"" Early in, the rest of the guys knew that Paul was going to be a problem so they warned him. ""He got muddy water,"" A referance to Pauls changing facination to the band ""Muddy Waters,"" Bluesy style. ""he one mojo filter,"" Paul was very persuasive and would make the rest of the members bend to his will. ""He say 'one and on and one is three',"" Is a referance to Paul trying to constantly tell the rest of the band that even witout him, the band could survive. ""Got to be good-looking because he's so hard to see,"" Paul was the ""cute"" one of the group and was also very hard to get along with and read as aperson.

WEllllll, thats my interpretation, i hopee it was helpful and clear things up.

Here come old flat top
He come groovin' up slowly
He got joo joo eyeballs
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker
He just do what he please.
I see this as John.
I don't get ""the flat top reference but everything else says John.
Joo Joo eyeballs. How could this not be john and his joo joe eye balls. His small round glasses?
Holy Roller- he looked like Jesus Christ with his ""hair down to his knee""
Got to be a joker, he just do what he please.
Again, This is total John doing and saying what he please. (telling the queen to rattle her Jewelry. The Beatles are bigger than Jesus...)

Verse 2: ""He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football

This is Ringo-
This is pretty mean spirited. Ringo was the least talented and least productive member- Bad Production.
Ono Sideboard- I believe this to reference his big sideburns.
He got feet down below his knee- Ringo, the drummer..sitting...feet down below his knees....
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease - Despite his lack of production,  everyone love him.

Verse 4:""He roller-coaster, he got early warning
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, ""One and one and one is three""

Yes, Paul.
But I believe one and one and one is referencing 3 Beatles and Paul being dead.

Remarkably for such a druggy song, there's nothing SPECIFICALLY drugs-related in the lyrics. 

It was originally meant as a campaign song for acid-guru Dr Timothy Leary when he was going to run for US President (no kidding!), but later John re-wrote it in its present form. Alongside references to blues singer Muddy Waters and Yoko's Ono's company ""Bag Productions"" there is an inevitable Walrus. ""Spinal cracker"" reportedly refers to a form of Japanese massage involving a wife (Yoko?) walking on her husband's spine! But guess why the song got banned by the BBC...

Yes, because the State-owned broadcasting corporation deemed that the mention of Coca-Cola was advertising and therefore could not be played on the BBC! 

The same thing happened with ""Lola"" by the Kinks, but they actually changed the lyric to the more evocative ""cherry cola"".

You're all wrong. It's John saying that the Beatles are his band, not Paul's. Each verse is about one of the members. Ringo, first verse. George, second verse. John, third verse, kinda making fun of himself with Ono side board  and bagging production. And the last one is an attack on Paul saying one and one and one meaning John, ringo and George. And saying the only reason Paul was popular was because he was good looking and couldn't notice him any other way. John saying come together over me, not Paul. And the fact that John did all the backup vocals for this song.

@Nader1993 















Like a lot of John's lyrics (and like Dylan's), there are multiple meanings.  The two didn't have their songs wrapped neatly in a bow for the listener to easily decipher.  Both Dylan and Lennon (who were friends) realized they were truly lyrical geniuses and immensely popular.  They probably took great glee in puzzling, provoking, intriguing and teasing their listeners.  Listen to Desolation Row or Like a Rolling Stone where there are countless meanings.  Same with I want you (she's so heavy)--drugs, sex?  

The song is probably on one level about the four individual Beatles.  It is also about taking drugs.  It is also about sex.  In fact it is eerily similar to Happiness is a Warm Gun which also had multiple meanings---an actual pistol, sex, shooting drugs, etc. (bang bang, shoot shoot).

The first two verses are interesting in that they both could be about George and Ringo.  Lyrrics could be interchanged.  Flat top.  Is that an old stodgy hair style?  A guitar top?  Groovin up slowly.  Is that the groove of the song suggesting the drummer?  Or someone who was square and was slowly becoming more hip?

Shoot coca cola has a drug reference but it could be about a Coke ad Ringo was asked to be ""shot"" in. 

The most interesting verse is the fourth which seems to be about Paul who is emotionally up and down (roller coaster), was getting guff form the other members for being too bossy (early warning), he was a buzz kill (mojo filter--filtered out other musicians creative ideas?).

The ""one and one an one is three"" seems to be John mocking Paul's overly simplistic song writing.  He later sang in ""How Do You Sleep,"" the only thing you did was Yesterday. 

""Got to be good lookin'"" refers to the fact that he was the cute Beatle but the only thing he is noticed for is his looks not his intellect...(so hard to see...empty mind, or it could simply mean ""hard to read"" since he was impulsive and bossy.  It seems to be John mocking Paul's overly simplistic mind.

The title Come Together could be John's plea to the band members to continue making great music together and not going solo.  Or it could refer to the 1960's ""let's all get along"" ideal.  Or again it could be about sex (cum together)...it could even be about Paul's death (come together over me in my grave).

There are a lot of religious meanings as well from their time in India and George's stronger religious beliefs.

I think it is by far their coolest song.  It has a Stones-like groove with dynamic drumming and and a serious danceable groove.  The song has a drug-like, happy groove with soaring lead guitar lines from George.  The ""shoot"" parts could suggest shooting up (drugs),shooting your load (sex), or even death (shoot me).

To me its talking about an unhealthy relationship. This love or relationship is compared to religion and the act of sex or giving one's body to someone is the sacrifice the guy/religion requires. It seems that the relationship is very one sided. Its like she wants to please this person but after the act she feels empty and gets nothing from it while the guy gets what he wanted, but she acknowledges her mistake for doing it despite knowing better.

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you
All over again, ooh
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain 
For my girl

Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, whoa

I don't wanna go back 
To just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
(oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh)
You’re the common denominator
(oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh)

Before you, love was low
Playing girls was my high
You changed the game
Now I put my card to the side, aye
When broken hearts rise up to say love is a lie
You and I will stand to be love’s reply

Out of all the things in life that I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me 
Is if you weren't here, here, here, yeahh, yeah

I don't wanna go back 
To just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm sayin'? 
(Do you understand?)
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
(oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh)
You’re the common denominator
(oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh)

I can’t imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give
You fill me up
And to all the heartaching
Jealous females hating
Imma hold it down for you
You, oh, whoa
You're the common denominator
oh, yeah, whoa
I don't wanna go back

I don’t wanna go back
To just being one half of the equation
(Half of the equation)
Do you understand what I’m sayin’?
(Whoa)
Girl without you I’m lost
Can’t fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You’re the common denominator
(oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh)
You’re the common denominator
(oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh)

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again

Shinedown is singing
""Your words still serenate me
Your lullabies won't let me sleep
I've never heard such a haunting melody
Oohh... it's killing me
You know I can barely breathe...


Just like a crow chasing a butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
You and I were getting high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away
I guess I was just a little too late...

If you want people to respect your music, first you have to respect other people's. Know what I'm saying? Everyone is entitled to their own tastes in music, and you can't change how people feel.

While we're used to having sensual, sexy songs from Camila, this time, she's delivering a soulful and deep hit about a failed relationship. At the beginning of the song, she starts out with all of the consequences of her breakup, all of the pain that she's living through and how the relationship made her feel so good. You're listening and thinking that she definitely needs to get back together with this person, right? As soon as you're sure that they were meant to be, Camila dives into all of the negative consequences that the relationship had on her. She repeats all of the good things about the relationship, but continues to list her negative feelings about it, too. In this beautiful ballad, we are not only reminded that Camila Cabello has some major pipes, but also that most things in life are not all good or all bad, and it is up to us to decide if the good outweighs the bad.

Obviously this song is about Wale questioning himself in a relationship going in the wrong direction, but these lyrics really made me think there's something even deeper to it;

In the viper room with just me and river phoenix 
With Courtney love and late Washington 
With a note there and I'm thinking of reading 
This ain't her, Chris Benoit 

River Pheonix overdosed on Heroin in 93' in the Viper Room (in LA) and in the same year Kurt Cobain (Courtney Loves husband of course) apparentley ""committed suicide"" (I believe he was murdered though) the next year in 1994. And the note he refers to is obviously the ""suicide note"" Kurt left in the greenhouse. Then you have Chris Benoit, who murdered his family then killed himself (a fishy enough story behind all of that). Wale is known to have ties in the Illuminati (he raps about it himself) and all the people just mentioned have/had ties to the Illuminati as well. All suspicious and dramatic/tragic deaths.  I would love to know exactly what Wale is saying there exactly, but it's an interesting few lines he threw in there to say the least. I hope to meet him one day and ask him myself. I live near DC and that's where he reps, so who knows!? If I do I will report what he said here first!

I think it's about her bipolar, because it reminds me of my own. people find mental illness really hard to understand, especially when it involves risky or out of control behaviours, it scares them. I like this song most because she doesn't paint herself as the pure victim - it's kind of an empowering song, about not being ashamed of it and about not being defined by it. For me, anyway.

@LordJaeger6277 















I, personally, believe this song is about a person with multiple personality disorder. 

In the lines ""I can't help this awful energy"" and ""God damn right, you should be scared of me"" it seems as if there are multiple 'people' speaking, with one being meaner, and the other try in counteract the more negative voice. 

For the line,""Who is in control?"" The person singing is questioning which 'person' is actually controlling themself. 

Lastly, in these four lines, ""I'm well acquainted with villains that live in my head, they beg me to write them so they'll never die when I'm dead. And I've grown familiar with villains that live in my head, they beg me to write them so I'll never die when I'm dead."" The person is (possibly) keeping a sort of journal, or diary, that they write about this other personality. It may be that they are 'Immortalized' by being written down, and telling others about the 'Demons'. This especially rings with the ""So I'll never die when I'm dead"" as the person is talking about themself. 

Well, that's just a theory. A song theory! 
(Game theory reference aside, don't take this as the 'real' interpretation of the song, I'm merely a bored 12 year old, interpreting a song I like.)

@Why not?

Some people with MPD have radically different personalities, almost to the point where they nearly become a completely different person during a personality change. The 'real' version of herself is the one who is desperately trying to keep the other 'sides' under control, hence saying that she can't control herself.

The other side; the alternate persona, if you may; instead embraces this, seeming to thrive on others' pain and suffering. 

I was actually 12 when I first posted the above (original theory (?)), and am now 14, so.

Explaining it using some verses of the song? 			

I think sending her away to find riches means 'they' see her as a larborer 
More than just the house is alive, shes trapped in the house with her own monsters
Shes alone with her thoughts and her mind is driving her crazy, she cant control it.
She cant control herself and at the same time she can, its incredibly confusing to describe, but if youre experienced it, it makes perfect sense

@Justapersonyay 















I think this song is about an eating disorder. 
The first verse is describing how someone gets hooked with an ED. “They send me away to find them a fortune” reminds me of the promise from Ana (in my case) that I’ll be happy once I’m thin, all my problems will disappear. “The house was awake, the shadows and monsters, the hallways, they echoed and groaned” makes me think of the various triggers around my house that remind me of how “imperfect” I am. 
“I sat alone, in bed till the morning. I’m crying, “they’re coming for me”” for me sleeping is an escape from the constant obsessive thoughts but then when I wake up in the morning they are right there again (they’re coming for me). 
“I tried to hold these secrets inside me” is about the struggle to hide the disorder. 
“My minds like a deadly disease” anorexia can be a deadly disease so I think this is pretty on point. 
“I’m bigger than my body/ I’m bigger than these bones” is all about body image and how it doesn’t matter how small I get I’ll feel and believe I look bigger than I actually am. 
“I’m colder than this home/ I’m meaner than my demons” is referring to how my self talk is sometimes worse than what Ana tells me. 
“All the kids cried out. “Please stop, you’re scaring me”” makes me think of how children sometimes stare at people who are extremely thin and sometimes they looked shocked or scared. 
“I can’t help this awful energy” expresses how powerless I feel to this disorder. “God damn right, you should be scared of me” I always think people should be afraid of my mind because of how toxic and cruel it is. 
“Who is in control?” For me my eating disorder is about control and starving makes me feel in control but since I feel often that I can’t actually make the decision to eat without feeling awful about it it makes me question who is really in control? 
“I paced around for hours on empty” is taking about the over exercising aspect. 
“I jumped at the slightest of sounds” this might be a bit of a stretch but I think of the word “sounds” as gaining weight. And how scary of an idea it is to gain weight.  
“I couldnt stand the person inside me. I turned all the mirrors around” both of these lyrics are very literal.
“I’m well acquainted with the villains that live in my head” being with the villain of Ana is typically a comfort and I know her very well. 
“they beg me to write them so they’ll never die when I’m dead” reminds me of the desire to take photos to document the weight loss, so even after I’m dead people will be able to see the “success”.

I mean no one can say for sure, but it is pretty obvious he wrote this about Rihanna and their very public relationship problems. I think people assume because Chris Brown did that to her he's this horrible person, but this song shows that he really deeply cared about her and wanted to try to make things right, he's just a flawed person who messed up big time. The song is basically saying I know our relationship is hanging by a thread and I didn't treat you the way I should...but if you give me another chance we can start over with a clean slate. It's a beautiful song, no one can deny that, regardless of what you think about Chris Brown personally.

Such a good song. To me, the band is singing about that bittersweet feeling when you look back on times when you were younger and in love for the first time. You never forget your first love; they're always a part of you. My first love and I were together for six years. Broke up last October. I'll never forget him. The lyrics in this song are spot on. The first person who stole your heart will always be with you. And even when you move on or find someone new, you will still find yourself wondering whatever happened to them or if they still occasionlly think of you, too.

I see others points about him being alive. But I think that the guy may have died, not from suicide though. I think he may have died when they were very much and happily in love. She was devastated, and it may have been months or even years since his passing and she hasnt moved on, when her friends keep pushing her to do so.

Sometimes she has the feeling that when she does leave earth to heaven that he wont be waiting on her. Every night she dreams of him and its a dark paradise because even though she loves him so much she knows it just a dream, and when she wakes up, she knows he wont be there.

""There's no remedy for memories""  Theres not a cure for remembering something there's no way to get him out of her head, and she doesnt want him out. She can feel him touching her in her dreams, she wants to be with him so much she doesnt want to wake up.

I think the song is pretty straight forward for me, the narrator of this song is in love with someone who has just died. Everyone keeps persuading her to move on with her life, but she can't get over him because when you find true love it lives on. She  wishes that she could die so that she could be with him on the other side, but until then she can't forget all of the memories that still run through her head. She is with him in her dreams, but it's a dark pleasure because even though she's with him, she knows he's still gone.

			@awelty exactly she even says I wish I were dead (Dead with you) I dont know how someone got him being alive out of this.			

This song means something a little more different to me. I suffer from paranoia and mental disorders. Often times I feel like my sanity is not there anymore. I feel lost and in a different world altogether. This song describes exactly what I feel.
When it says ""there is no remedy for melody for remedy your face is like a melody it won't leave my head."" I feel that in moments of panic and fear all I can think about is how I miss being calm and at rest. When it says ""your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine. But I wish I was dead,"" it's like my mind telling me that everything is fine, but the only way I'll feel fine is if I am dead. ""Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise, no one compares to you, I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side."" I feel like when I close my eyes, I can block out the world, it's dark, and temporarily calming. But when I open them, I am sucked back into this world, and am afraid of what's outside.

251,Dead Flowers.json,"
No comments?! This song is AMAZING, one of my favorites from Miranda Lambert. The way I interpret the song is like this. She knows the relationship has hit a dead end, and that he doesn't feel the same for her as he once did. ""I feel like the tires on this car, you said they won't go far but we're still rolling"" He is saying their relationship won't last much longer but as of now their still going. ""He ain't feeling anything, my love, my hurt, or the sting of this rain. I'm driving through a hurricane, all he can say is, man ain't it such a nice day?"" He isn't experiencing any pain in the fact that their relationship is slowly dying, while her heart is slowly breaking. Soon the relationship will be dead, like dead flowers, and she is left broken hearted while he goes on feeling no pain. Thats how I like to interpret it because I went through the same thing. Stupid boys ;)

			From her website:  Lambert got the inspiration to write the song from a personal experience. “I had some flowers that I got for Valentines Day in a vase on the kitchen table. I was going on the road so I had to throw them in the yard. They were just laying there and it was a really sad image. The song came to me right away and was one of those ones that kinda wrote itself.”

I agree, the relationship is over. The girl is broken hearted and grieving while the boy doesn't feel a thing. Almost like he didn't even know there was anything wrong in the first place. Sounds like a typical guy!

Well i believe my ex-girlfriend can relate to this song every well. It seemed like our relationship wasn't going any further, and it was slowly dying into nothing. One day she posted these lyrics on her facebook page and it was an automatic ""oh shit"" flare going off in my head. She use to sing it to me in her car all the time, I guess I should have gotten the clue and looked up the meaning before it was too late, but it was, our relationship went dead, like dead flowers, now i'm here today, wishing for a better tomorrow, and maybe those flowers will come alive again.

This became one of my favorite Miranda songs now that I can relate to it more.

The beginning of the song is a metaphor for the beginning of their relationship, """"Aint they beautiful"" he said"" is referring to how he felt about her in the beginning of the relationship. Everything was exciting and new.  But just as dead flowers do, his feeling became dull and grey.

When their relationship has faded, he's not affected by it, while she's left with the weight of the relationship on her shoulders. She realizes she has to throw away their relationship, just as she would throw away dead flowers.

255,Dear Diamond.json,"
Lovely, such a lovely song. Definitely my favorite off the new album.

She's pretty much conversing with her wedding ring throughout the song and musing. It's very much like a Dear Diary song, but the diamond is her personal diary because it holds such significance.

""You wrap around my finger just like he does"" basically says that he's wrapped around her finger (just like a wedding band) because he's so in love with her. Should she or should she not tell him that she cheated on him and she's been lying to his face? Things are pretty and shiny on the outside, but it's too good to be true.

""You cost more than he wanted to lose"" moves into a metaphor that the ring is symbolizing the promise and vows that they made, and that she (or both of them) are going to pay a dear price for breaking the promise. The broken vows/promise would make him lose more than he could ever bear. It'll break him if he knows the truth. She can't face it.

""Dear diamond be my saving grace"" means that she's praying with the ring now and she's made up her mind not to tell him. She's hoping he never finds out. The ring represents the new secret that she's keeping, only her and the ring know it now.

I'd like some clarification and input with the entire last verse. I love the phrasing of ""some people you have, some people you hold"" and understand that this means some people you can have a meaningless relationship or a fling with (have) and others you carry with you throughout life (hold). She's choosing to be more faithful and hold him through their marriage from now on because she realizes the intensity of her mistake. But how does this specifically relate to the wedding ring's band of gold? Is there more or have I got it all?


***Also, I'd like to add a correction. It's ""Lie like the devil, or just face the truth"", not ""Well I like the devil, just face the truth"".

			This is how I always took the last verse (which kind of conflicts with the way you've already interpreted it, but perhaps we can meet some middle ground and actually figure it out?):

I always looked at it the opposite you do, as far as the have/hold. I always pictured that when she says that ""some people you have,"" those are the ones that stick with you, the ones you marry and carry throughout your life, etc., whereas the ""people you hold"" are the ones that are temporary. I look at it more like this - and I'll compare it to something simple, completely unrelated - you can have your own... hairdryer. And it's yours. Or, you can borrow somebody else's - you can hold onto your friend's hairdryer.. But eventually you're going to let go of it. (That's probably the stupidest comparison I've ever made, but hopefully it got my train of thought across.)
So then, having that idea in mind - that the people you have are the ones that are with you permanently, by your side through it all, etc... and the people you hold are more temporary and such... We go on to the next couple of lines.
""Dear diamond, I promise to keep / This secret I have while he's holding me.""
That part is important, I think, because it says a lot about her and how she sees herself and her infidelity. She's saying that while the man she cheated with was somebody she only held, the fact that he is now a secret means that she will always have him - he will always be there with her, always be there in between her and her husband, will always be weighing on her mind somewhere in the background. She can pretend it never happened but that doesn't mean she'll ever be able to forget it or stop feeling guilty about it. And so her husband is ""holding"" her - he's holding on to her and he thinks that he has her, but she's the kind of person you hold, not the kind of person you have. (Which, could possibly be just because of the secret that she has. It would separate them, I imagine, in a way that he's not aware of but in a way that she'd be way too aware of..)
I'm not too sure about the importance of ""with your band of gold,"" either, but I'm thinking it's just to show that even though she's not the person to be 'had,' she is now, anyways - the band of gold is just another thing holding on to her, maybe? I don't know. Hehe.
Maybe that makes sense, maybe it doesn't, maybe you think I'm right, maybe you're more right than I am - I'm not sure... But anyways, there's my two cents.			






			This is how I always took the last verse (which kind of conflicts with the way you've already interpreted it, but perhaps we can meet some middle ground and actually figure it out?):

I always looked at it the opposite you do, as far as the have/hold. I always pictured that when she says that ""some people you have,"" those are the ones that stick with you, the ones you marry and carry throughout your life, etc., whereas the ""people you hold"" are the ones that are temporary. I look at it more like this - and I'll compare it to something simple, completely unrelated - you can have your own... hairdryer. And it's yours. Or, you can borrow somebody else's - you can hold onto your friend's hairdryer.. But eventually you're going to let go of it. (That's probably the stupidest comparison I've ever made, but hopefully it got my train of thought across.)
So then, having that idea in mind - that the people you have are the ones that are with you permanently, by your side through it all, etc... and the people you hold are more temporary and such... We go on to the next couple of lines.
""Dear diamond, I promise to keep / This secret I have while he's holding me.""
That part is important, I think, because it says a lot about her and how she sees herself and her infidelity. She's saying that while the man she cheated with was somebody she only held, the fact that he is now a secret means that she will always have him - he will always be there with her, always be there in between her and her husband, will always be weighing on her mind somewhere in the background. She can pretend it never happened but that doesn't mean she'll ever be able to forget it or stop feeling guilty about it. And so her husband is ""holding"" her - he's holding on to her and he thinks that he has her, but she's the kind of person you hold, not the kind of person you have. (Which, could possibly be just because of the secret that she has. It would separate them, I imagine, in a way that he's not aware of but in a way that she'd be way too aware of..)

			I really like your interpretation. From what I have found, the song was written for a boy named Tyler that died of cancer in 2013. I first heard the song and though it was about life's struggles or about addiction. I have dealt with both in my life. Many of my loved ones have struggled with addiction and this song at first felt like someone helping a friend in need with their addiction.

			All seems pretty accurate.  I think the line, ""when you feel my heat look into my eyes, it's where my demons hide"" what he is really trying to say is that when you see him get angry that you need to understand that there are reasons in his past for it.  He want the person to look into his soul and understand his anger.

@rep21 really great interpretation. I didn't understand all rhymes because I'm not native english speaker and some of them are really in the spirit of the english language. But, I understand refrain differently. I think he don't sing that he is bad person or angry. I think he want to say that he is broken and sad inside - not bad - that he has problems and that people often hurt him - because of that he is wounded - and that are his demons - his pain - not his badness (and official video of the song shows that). And ""don't get too close, it's dark inside"" - he doesn't want to hurt someone psychical - because he has many wounds and because of pain he carries inside. He thinks that he is not good enough (because of low self esteem) to make someone happy and that he can't give all the love he wants and he thinks that person deserves... and that there maybe are someone better for that person. So, he is really not bad person, but life hurts him and that marked him.

@rep21 there is a lot of good stuff in you interpretation.  However, why does everyone always assume the good are the naïve?  I assure you it is the sinners who are mistaken about how things really are.
When most people in his situation want to hide the truth, it is not for the other person's sake.  Rather, there is a dynamic interplay where the actor does not have to really face the emotional and moral aspects of the truth (although they know what is the case in an analytical sense) until the loved one knows.  Note, it is not ""there is nowhere YOU can hide"" but ""we"".  The unwillingness to face the significance of the truth is one of the great powers demons and devils (""the beast inside"") have over people - shame.  He projects not only shame, however, but hopelessness.  and he likes to use we instead of I, deflecting responsibility and claiming this is God's sentence for him (my kingdom come).
But, where I really am at odds is with the claim that eyes that shine bright are naïve.  Obviously, he can't save anything, so the statement, ""I wanna save that light"" is offered in irony. As the next passages clarifies (""shows"") it is exactly that light that can save him.  After all, it's dark inside.

how sweet, it's about his lover being the only bright point in his life and the world. Darkness and evil envelops everything else - the only saints are manmade statues, people are ""made of greed,"" etc. Worst of all, there are demons inside him. He's conflicted; he's pleading to her to save him while acknowledging it's better to push her away for her own good (""It's woven in my soul / I need to let you go"").

The song is about ""dancing"" with a woman. However, I feel that ""dance"" is code word for sex. Dancing can be very sensual (watch their video clip ... I don't think they are trying to hide that it is about more than just dancing).

Most the lyrics deal with that they will win the woman over and ""dance"" with them and they'll love it. Hahaha ... what most men want to believe anyway!!

Also surprised that this is number one on the charts in Australia (not a large Spanish speaking community here ... probably the last Spanish song to rate so high in the charts would have been Las Ketchup. Although it is the Justin Bieber version that is popular in Australia (so a bit of English).

""I'm still desperate for you""
The way I look at this song, from my experience is that even through all of the crap this guy has done to you, after all the time broken up, the lies the guy says, blah blah youre still in love with him and would do anything for him, and to just be happy again with him.  
I agree with mysweetoctober, You know you shouldnt be talking to this guy, because it makes getting over him so much harder, but yet you long for him to just say hi.

@chevgirl77 















I agree with the other people who commented on this song. 
The girl is in love with the guy even though he's no good. 
I'm sort of going through this situation myself (aren't we all) and ""I'm still desperate for you"" sticks out....

""Well it's too damn bad you didn't have a chance to make me your best friend
You were too caught up in giving too much up and not doing what you should have been""
My take on this: The guy has a significant other, whether it be a girlfriend, a fiance or a wife - but the girl is still in love with him regardless. They are having an affair but in the end he choses to stay with his wife. That's why she tells him, it's too damn bad you didn'th ave a chance to make me your best friend - she felt like she could have given him more than who he had at home. And the part 'you were too caught up in giving too much up' .. He was scared about losing his security at home for this girl although he knows that he should have left his wife because he was so much happier with the other girl ....

That's just my take on it. Think what you will.

			Even though this was written in a joking manner, I love how accurate it was to the song's meaning, haha.			

To me, this song is about a relationship which the singer (lana) knows is going to be short yet is still in the relationship. This song is also about the girl knowing that the boy is not good for her, ""your no good for me"" but she still wants him (and loves him) ""but baby i want you"" lana says ""maybe i like this roller-coaster"" to show that she likes that the guy is crazy and bad. I think the name of the song is brilliant. The way i think of it, mountain dew is unhealthy. I think that lana is comparing the relationship to the drink and saying diet mountain dew to show that no matter how much a girl tries to change a bad boy, he can never be changed.

@lanafan 















There's so many things this song could mean. It could literally be about Lana riding around with a guy in New York city, wearing heart-shaped sunglasses and drinking Diet Mountain Dew. I serverly doubt it's that literal though. 

Let's break it down:

""You're no good for me
Baby you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby I want you, I want you""

-Obviously this guy is no good for her, but she wants him. 

""Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love""

-She compares this guy to Diet Mountain Dew, because on the surface he looks good for her, but in reality, he's actually terrible for her just like the beverage itself.
-She also says ""Never was there ever a girl so pretty"" She could be talking about New York itself or the Statue of Liberty or it could be talking about herself. 
-She also questions their love for one another, doubting it. 

""Baby put on heart shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I've been waiting up all night""

-By telling him to put on ""heart-shaped sunglasses"" I think she's asking him to at least pretend to be in-love with her, even though they're not. 
-She's not going to ""listen to what the past says"" perhaps because he's treated her poorly or he has a bad boy reputation. 

""Take another drag turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be all right""

-She's comparing herself to a cigarette. By turing her to ashes, he's using her and he's lying to her to get what he wants, perhaps, or vice-versa. Either way, she doesn't care. 
-The second part might be talking about how she's not that experienced, whether it be sex or something else. Whatever it is, he's going to teach her. 

""Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times

-She's talking about throwing her morals out the window and not caring about what other people think. 
-She knows what they're there for, which most likely is sex. 

""Maybe I like this rollercoaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe this weed it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye""

-She's talking about how this is an unhealthy realtionship, but she likes it. 

Overall, I think the song is about a sexual realationship thats clearly unhealthy for her because she knows this is going no where, but she doesn't care. It looks good, even though it's terrible for her, just like Diet Mountain Dew.

@iambones That part is in the demo version, though. Not the official Diet Mountain Dew on her album Born To Die. 			

First of all, people always say that diet sodas are ""healthy"" or better for them, when in reality they are just as bad with added artificial sugars and such. I think this relates with the unhealthy relationship she has with a man--the one in which Lana ignores the bad, maybe even embraces it, because she loves him so much. She knows he is no good for her, but she wants him anyway. ""Turn me to ashes"" also shows she knows he's bad for her. She doesn't care what people think/say of her or ""what the past says"". They will take Jesus off the dashboard, even, so that truly no one can judge them. She loves him because he gives her a rush--the roller coaster, the speed, the high--and he will teach her ""just what fast is,"" which is the feeling we know from her interviews she craves: feeling alive, young, wild, and free. That's why she loves the men that mostof us find terrible! She keeps asking ""Do you think we'll be in love forever?"", which to me is the first time on the album she shares the same doubts we as the listeners may have for their relationship (though, she surely is positive of her feelings/love for him)

@creyk 















I think the song is about a rushing relationship of which she knows won't last long.
So, firstly New York is a very hectic city, everyone is always in a hurry and is in a rush and Diet Mountain Dew is a beverage from which you will get a sugar rush, getting in high spirits but when the rush is gone you will end up very tired. She asks herself if they would be in love forever, but then she just asks if they actually would be in love, leaving out the 'forever'

""Baby put on heart shaped sunglasses, cause we're gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says, I've been waiting up all night""

-i don't know if this saying exits in english, but we german say ""durch eine Rosarote Brille sehen"" which means something like ""seeing trough a pink glasses"", so when someome is in love they see trough these glasses and ignore all the problems, which come with love, Lana could mean something like that by saying that she puts on her 'heart shaped sunglasses', which is quite similar. She just sees the good things, trying to ignore the bad because they 'gonna take a right' (starting this superficial relationship)
She also says that she's been trough bad times, maybe her boyfriend suddenly ended up the relationship and for a long time she's been waiting for him to come back to her, which never happend

Take another drag turn me to ashes, Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is, Say it's gonna be all right

-she sees herself as a cigarette, which is used selfishly by men and after he takes a drag (have sex), she is left behind like the ashes of a cigarette;
Also the compares love to a 'lie', so love doesn't really exist in this relationship ans she knows that he is just playing with her feelings to get sex with her.
With 'fast' she may states again the 'quick' relationship and she has almost no hopes anymore that this relationship would be different to the other loveless relationships she's been through

Let's take Jesus off the dashboard, Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for, Saved too many times

-knowing that this kind of relationship isn't really religious, she forgets about jesus  by the reason that they both know what they got: a loveless relationship, only existing for the sex

Maybe I like this rollercoaster, Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe this weed it brings me closer, I could sparkle up your eye

-here love is compared with a ride on a rollercoaster, which is speedful and shows the up and down of this relationship
(isn't it 'speed' instead of 'weed'?"") the speed of this exciting ride brings her closer to the feeling that she's actually in love with this guy and forgot about the other, and now she has the hope that he could be in love with her too.

So, in the end she knows that this would be just another 'meaningless' relationship, which is as fast and as fading as a big city like NY or a sip of Mountain Dew. The both seem like they would bring happiness, but then ending up in a dejection.

There seems to be massive confusion on the lyrics. The lyrics here are from the first music video. The problem is that there are several version floating around. Two demos, the album version, and two music videos, most of which have different compositions. 

Mainly the stanzas here are correct with a few alterations. Sometimes the last word is repeated and often both of the Diet Mountain Dew stanzas are used together. I didn't rewrite the whole stanzas so that this wouldn't be too long. The only one not listed in the current lyrics is number 10.

[1] You're no good for me...

[2] DMD, baby, NYC/ Never was there ever a girl so pretty...

[3] Baby put on heart shaped sunglasses...

[4] Take another drag turn me to ashes...

[5] Hit me my darling tonight...

[6] DMD, baby, NYC/ Can we get it downlow, down and gritty...

[7] Let's take Jesus off the dashboard...

[8] Maybe I like this rollercoaster...

[9] Hit me and tell me you're mine...

[10]
baby stopping at seven eleven
bearing his white Pontiac heaven
do you think we'll be in love forever
do you think we'll be in love
**

Born To Die Album Version = 1.2-6.3.4.2-6.7.8.2-6.1.2.10.2-6.1(x3)

Music Video#1  = 1.2.3.4.5.2-6.7.8.9.2-6.1(x2).2.10.6.2 

Music Video#2 (NYC T-Shirt) & Demo#1 = 1.2-6.3.4.2-6.7.8.2-6.1(x2).2-6.2.10.2-6.1

Demo#2 = 1.2(x2).3.4.2(x2).7.8.2(x2).1(x2).2(x6)

Hopefully this will help everyone know which version they are listening to.

Also I think the line is
""Maybe the speed it brings me closer""

i think this song is about how people should leave all the technologic stuff if they want to find love or friends, becausec they won't find them with their head stuck in the screen.
they are practically saying that when you find someone you love he will just disconnect you from everything and make you feel alive in a way that the internet can't make you feel/

The ""carrots"" he is talking about can be viewed metaphorically, but he literally is talking about carrots, which is supposed to be kind of ironic. Carrots are technically living, they might even have a soul, but that doesn't matter when it comes to their harvest - they are eaten by species that are higher in the food chain. If life did not feed on life, then all life would die.
The irony of ""carrots"" is that they obviously do not have a nervous system, and to the best of our scientific knowledge, they do not feel pain or suffering or anything at all.
But if we do not care about carrots, why should we care about flies and insects either? Flies have a very simple nervous system, and arguably, they do not feel any complex amount of pain.
If we do not care about the flies, then why care about the birds who eat the flies? Birds have a relatively simple nervous system, and they most likely do not feel any complex amount of pain.
But if we do not care about the birds, then why care about the cats that eat the birds? And why care about the dogs that eat the cats? The deer that eat the grass? The pigs that eat their own shit? The humans that eat the pigs?
Pain is just a sensation - an electric signal sent along a sequence of organic tissue that is all essentially composed of just ordinary matter: single molecules; protons, electrons, neutrons, etc.. 
All of which ultimately feels nothing, and the sensation of pain was hollow and empty..

It would seem that this song (as well as the entire album) presents us the duality that They/He/It (whether it was Maynard, other members of the band, or just Tool in general) has been afflicted with - the paradox of morality. How can we claim to be for good and against evil, and how can we claim to be righteous, if we have to inflict pain on an innumerable amount of other creatures simply in order to survive?

What if it turned out that we were all unknowingly on a farm as well, and aliens came to Earth one day to harvest us -- and feed not on our flesh, but torture us and feed on the tragedy produced from our cries of agony and torment?
Without that tragedy to feed on, the aliens would enter a state of unbearable nihilism due to the lack of any purpose - but when they torture us, it reminds of them of the temporary nature of existence, even their own, and the ultimate mortality of all things. It makes them thankful to exist. Without it, they would die.

Was there ever a difference between these hypothetical aliens and the species (whatever it may have been, the song suggests rabbits) that ate the carrots?

Where do we draw the line between right and wrong? There is no possible way to draw an absolute line between ""when it is right, and when it is wrong"", since right and wrong are relative to their observer. Morality is a human invention. But subjectivity does not necessarily imply fallibility. The notions of ""right and wrong"" exist, because we make them exist - but that is it.

However, considering morality in the case of humanity alone and amongst itself, it can be stated as a fact that our survival requires some degree of unconditional cooperation with each other. Mothers have to love their baby and feed their baby, or else their baby dies. Members of society have to cooperate with each other, or else humanity's more complex desires (such as the arts, technology, higher knowledge, science, etc) would be impossible to achieve. You're reading this on a computer right now. Do you know how to make a computer from scratch? I don't mean  buying the parts and putting it together - I mean harvesting the raw resources from bare earth with your bare hands and no tools besides what you can find for yourself, and then assembling those resources into a computer? I highly doubt anyone on this planet is capable of that. Your charade of a lifestyle automatically drafts you as a member of society's morals and ethics.
Do morals and ethics get out-dated from time to time? Yes. Do we need to revise them? Yes. It's far from perfect, and its highly unlikely it will ever reach perfection. All you can do is find out for yourself through experience what YOU think is the best way to improve the world, and then REPRESENT these ideals of yours by integrating them into your individual persona.
It is NOT possible to predict these changes/fluctuations in morality and ethics by using logical sciences and measurements alone. There are too many variables involved in the fine-tuning of morality, and breaking it down mathematically is impossible, and even if we could do it, the results would be beyond human comprehension.
You have to use your intuition gained from experience in conjunction with logical sciences and measurements in order to come up with the best representation you can. Many people do not know it, but most people are already finely-synchronized with morality via their intuition, and they do not even have to worry about it - the perceived disruption occurs when individuals try to exploit the rhetoric and structure of morality for their own personal gain that is unrelated to morality.

So to basically sum it all up:
Based on our subjective experiences, we must use our intuition to participate (with as much effort as we care to put into it) in refining society's morality to resolve to see what we perceive to be its current flaws. When we do this, our persistence and humility will eventually bring us to satisfactory results that we can at least be content with. Some people have it easier than others - and from my perspective, yes, it is morally correct to crash these types of people down whenever they are acting cocky to someone who has to deal with more than them. Maybe that isn't the same for you, maybe it is, and that's the beauty of it I guess.
Our experience here will be worthwhile - but that doesn't mean you are automatically guaranteed satisfactory without having to work for it at a level past your comfort zone.

We can improve our lives, to whatever extent we allow ourselves to.
However, it is unknown whether or not we can improve the state of all humanity. 
This might be as good as it gets as far as our world goes, but that's only because society can't hold everyone's hand and wipe their asses for them - they know themselves the best, and only they know how to fulfill their needs the best. The sky is the limit for improving our own lives, because whatever you consider the definition of ""improvement"" to be is up to you..

Wow this is a long ass comment okay I'm done. There's Tool in a nutshell for you ladies and gentlemen

@SpunkySkunk347 















This song, is divisible into 2 parts, each with a seperate yet connected meaning, hence why there are 2 seperate monologues seperated by the middle chant of the tune;

First, Maynard is very very obviously poking at relgion. He even uses the sound of sheep in order to make sure that the point is put across to the common person. He is simply saying how powerful education, manipulation, and religion are combined when the only common denominator of the human mind is fear. Fear can be used to make the sheep believe that the carrots are real and alive, and things that logic neglects, such as the rabbits needing glasses, would be ignored and taken for fact.

Fear is all powerful, and fear of damnation and ideas can change reality in our minds, from the peace and coexistance with all things to which we all share. ""This is necissary. Life feeds on life, feeds on life, feeds on life..."" We must consume in order to survive, the curse of consciousness makes this difficult because of our love for things and one another, we must accept it is the way of things.

Last but not least, Maynard's landlord points to something that is the opposite of what he accepts as all things being connected. While we are all connected, it is because we do not own everything or anything, and why ""satan is seen as our cousin, and god as our father in this message, by a ""psycho"" who cannot see that not all things belong to him. the concept of ownership, greed; are not unique to our people (dogs and animals even believe this). Strangley we see that true insanity is believing that everything is yours, while we as people view that ourselves. Nothing belongs to anyone; we are one as a mind.

This is what Maynard says.

			A lot of different interpretations of the song i am reading ( I imagine that was Tool's goal was all along) But lets keep the meaning simple. two short monologues, the first a piss take on religion, the second a curious phone message on Mr Keenen's answering machine. Both totally unrelated, but put together, oh my what a reaction. 

PS Whats with all the nonsence about the rabbit having a symbolic meaning. The ""rabbits wear glasses"" in my opinion comes from two sources. Bugs bunny likes carrots and the old wives tale that carrots improve eyesight. Simple.

ok, well, i know this probably won't really explain the song. but, what i got the vibe from it was that humans are basically animals and are natural. religion and society makes us, as humans, into who we are. Every single time i hear this song, I remember the book ""lord of the flies"" especially at the part where maynard yells ""this is necessary...life feeds on life feeds on..."" And LOTF is a DAMNED good example of humans turning into what we naturally are. Beasts. Recently, in my english class ((which i'm failing because i spend time daydreaming trying to figure what we're here for)) we discussed lotf and that just got my attention. Not to say that my english class is boring, but it doesn't really reach to me, if i'm alone with the teacher, i'm able to understand. ANYWAY...kinda got off topic, the first part of the song i believe is showin how religion basically is a flaw, and shows that religion is just a facade. Facade as in we use religion to make ourselves better, or at least feel better. . . i dunno, i think i'll basically post later when i'm not tired

@therumbucket Don't fail your english class!!! Aww well. It's too late now! I hope everything worked out for you. You have good taste in music!			

this is the best explanation i can come up with 

Part 1:  Televangelist on TV making ludacrous claims, and people follow him, hence the sheep, definitly a religious mockery no doubt. The line life feeds on life feeds on life is saying one organism must survive off another organism to live. 

Part 2: Crickets- has to do with Part 3, woke up in a ditch, this is the sound of who ever it was sleeping in the ditch. 

Part 3: has to be about life being connected, i didnt get the idea i had now until i listened to Vicarious and thought about it.  remember Life Feeds on Life, basic survival, one organism must survive off another organism to live, if you are an animal, you kill other animals, take land away from other animals. okay now. human perspective.  He thinks Everything is his, he took the territory, its his, he sees the sky, its blue, its his color, he is covered in goo(blood, possibly killing who ever was on the land, so now he is claiming it as his own. he wipes the goo(blood) off of this hands onto the green grass, and now his color is green b/c he saw the grass and if the grass is green than his color is green. when he says why does everything have to change he is refering to the colors changing and his wants changing. new color new posession. when he says waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you, i get this vibe now, he thinks all these things are his because he cant rememeber. he sees the car and thinks its his car. the god and satan thing may be in their because his memory is coming back to him, and why doesent anyone else understand these important things?, i think the man is establishing a state of empowerment and he feels like he is better than everyone, he is coming out of his confused and head aching state into a more ""clear"" state of mind.He gets to the car and tries all the doors, locked, meaning its not his car, funny that he doesnt check for keys or anything.mabey he knows its his car(thinks it is anyway) but doesnt understand what it does, hence he wouldnt know he needs keys, he just knows its locked. like when people wake up with brain damage and dont know who they are or what is theirs or who their family is or where they are but they know how to speak and they know what everyhign is like a bed, a chair, a bowl. expensive leather camera case laying in the seat. it belongs to the people who are in the field by the woods,( taking pictures, mabey bird watchers) you begin to walk toward them. the guy is wanting to kill i would suppose. your color is red, this is strange, his color should have been red when he saw the car and it should have turned to the color of the field/ woods/ people when he saw them. mabey his color is red now because he want to kill them but i dont think so. i think its red because he wants the red car and when he sees the people he knows he can get the car by killing them so he sees red, like its his mission to obtain the red, so when he walks toward them, he thinks red becuase he knows if they are dead than its his. and of course those little people out their were your too.  well he is now thinking these are his people, that they belong to him like the car and the grass and the sky, so mabey he doesnt want to kill them. or mabey this means he has killed them and they are now his.....

what i got out of the song is that when we first start finding out about life and when we are actually old enough to understand some of the things that go on, we realize that life is brutal. we always here about what is wrong and what is right and we are never able to make choices for outselves without getting crap from at least 1/3 of the people you know. everyone is so overwhelmed about trying to be politically correct that we lose ourselves. i think that ""cries of the carrots"" is just an anology for how much we have lost. kind of a metaphor for all the little things we take for granted. and we don't really see how important some things (or people) are until we are put in a desperate situation. when i first heard this song my brother said that it was ""amazingly kickass, who else [but tool] could make a song about carrots!?"" but after i listed to the song more, and heard more of the lyrics i saw so much more. i guess this may be a little far fetched to some, but the main reason i love tool (and maynard james) is that their songs are the ones that can truly make me think. its like a verbal rubix cube. i always have to try to find hidden meaning, and try to find something that is significan to my life.

			Tool isn't against drugs! Where'd you hear that? They wrote many of their songs under the influence of DMT, LSD, and ketamine. A quote from Maynard states: ""I think psychedelics play a major part in what we do, but having said that, I feel that if somebody's going to experiment with those things they really need to educate themselves about them. People just taking the chemicals and diving in without having any kind of preparation about what they're about to experience tend to have no frame of reference, so they're missing everything flying by and all these new perspectives. It's just a waste. They reach a little bit of spiritual enlightenment, but they end up going, 'Well, now I need that drug to get back there again.' The trick is to use the drugs once to get there, and maybe spend the next ten years trying to get back there without the drug.""

And then, of course from the beginning of ""Third Eye (Live version)"" - a bill hicks sample:


“See I think drugs have done some good things for us, I really do, and if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us, do me a favor: go home tonight and take all your albums, all your tapes, and all your cds and burn 'em. 'cause you know the musicians who made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years.... rrrrrrrrreal f**kin high on drugs.”

and as for the second part, i believe it is kind of like the evil portion of the song. . . You see, i believe the song is basically is in a scale type set up. With religion in the front, and human instinct in the middle, and human thought after we have regained conciousness from being set free

I think that the first part of this song is a stab at L. Ron Hubbard and other fundimentalists. I mean, I laugh every time I hear it, because it all seems so rediculous (a carrot holocaust, etc), just like everything that L. Ron has said. As for the second part, I'm not sure what it means, but I think I know better than to just accept the answer of ""it's his landlord leaving a message"". There's SOMETHING else there...

I think that this song is about this guy who loves a girl... Typical but they are fighting and he is trying to remind her of all the good times that they have had together. Also, he is asking her if she just wants to forget about all of the good times and just forget about him in general. Its just a long song asking if the good times are worth the bad. LOve this song :)

@musiclover518 















I think it is about trying to figure out if your significant other still wants you. Lately people have lost themselves in other things and its a guy singing to a girl trying to find out if he is still what she wants after all the time that has passed and changed them, broke them, and weighed on them. 

""Baby what are we becoming
It feels just like we're always running
Rolling through the motions everyday
I could lean in to hold you, or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know
I just want us back to the way we were before"" The first part seems that they are just co-exisiting more than in a relationship ""rolling through the motions everyday"". He wants to know what happened to the girl he fell in love with instead of the stranger he is with now.

The chorus is ""Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I still enough
Tell me don't I, or tell me do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Baby, do I"". It seems like he doesn't feel she wants him anymore, he is trying to figure out if she is the same girl or if there is any trace of her left or what they had. Then he is just merely saying should I stay because there is still something or should I go because there isn't anything left between us.

""Remember when we didn't have nothing
But a perfect simple kind of loving
Baby those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
Now I'm second guessing everything thing I see"". This is about the girl he fell in love with. They were wild and free without a care in the world. Now he is unsure of what she wants because ""I could lean in to hold you, or act like I don't even know you.....Seems like you could care less either way"".


I believe the song is merely about how the spark that once lit a fire between two people fades away when you stop noticing all the things good about that person. In the beginning you are looking for the good and bad in people and cherish the intimacy but as the time passes you stop learning things about one another because you believe you know them. You or the other person eventually could care less about the other being there because half the time they aren't acknowledged as being there. The little things they do start to matter a little less and you stop appreciating them.

Guess we’re all in trouble, huh?
Black clouds are upon us
And it’s doomsday on the other side of town.
That boy survived a severed head
When most would just give up for dead,
So I said: ""Al B. don’t get so upset.""
We all get scared of sticking out our necks
It’s expected!
So panic.
It’s time to lose control!
Turn off your radio!
You’re gonna feel alright!
Let’s do the panic tonight!

This place is turning upside down,
And shaking all of our change out,
And Charlotte’s tossing her hair to the hounds -
But it’s her head they want on the wall
Right next to the screeching owl,
And I don’t like this party
Or the sound
Of people walking across you when you’re down.
And that’s it!
So panic.
It’s time to lose control!
Turn up your radio!
Yeah you can bring your friends!
So we all do the panic again

When i first listen to a new song i critique it and naturally expect certain things from it kinda like when you listen to a song and you can guess the lyrics even tho you've never heard it.  he says everybody here's got somebody to lean on and then i hear shiver? im like whoa.  but the thing is i never get tired of the song.  When i hear this song it just makes me think of the beauty of the world. Look at the sky. It is amazing. i sound like a Stoner when i say that but i mean really......think how beautiful this world is and we take it for granted.  When i say that i am talking about Nature. Humans have created thier own problems.  Don't blame your problems on God.

This song possesess very influential but conscious material. The song focuses around the Rapture. and how everyday life and routines will someday come to a hult, and the world will come crashing down and those who believe they are annointed by their ""God"" will be saved. for example if you look at the end of the video the Band is on a raft and are soaring through the heavens (atmosphere) away from harm. and the line 'There's nothing here to run from' 'Cause, yeah everybody here's got someone to lean on'.i believe means that when the world ends (cataclysm begins) people should not reflect any fear but cherish the moments they have with those who are very important to them.

The thing I like most about Coldplay is that they don't pretend they've got it all figured out.  I guess I'm talking about Chris Martin since he writes the lyrics.  Anyways there is a modesty to them. They exude this fragility, like an innocent boy in a world of men.  It's not that they are blissfully ignorant or that they are infallable, but they acknowledge this and choose to see the beauty instead.  They may get down or not have anyone to talk to sometimes, but in the end they remember the beauty of the world.

			The song poses the question of whether one should view life as a pessimist or optomist.  This is accomplished through both lyrics and medody.  ""Bones sinking like stones..."" is an example of a pessimist's view while ""We live in a beautiful world"" holds the optimist's view.  The melody is that which is generally catagorized as mellow and depressing (pessimistic), but some how generates a feel-good response (optomistic).  Thus the lyrics and melody pose this question.  The final line ""Oh all that I know..."" along with the title ""Don't Panic"" suggest the answer to the question is that of the optimist's view.  Although sometimes ugly, one must remember life is beautiful.

@GoodGodWhatABeatnik 















i don't see how there could be any doubt about the connection to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. If you bothered to read the rest of the series, you would know that the idea of home is a recurring theme that Arthur becomes less attached to throughout the books as he realizes the insignificance of a home because of how it keeps a person from seeing as much of the Universe as he can in his life. The verses refer to the battles that are constantly being fought over the ownership of planets in the book and the futility of war. THe chorus is an ironic statement on the attachment a person or race feels to their world, although their ""world"" is just their point of view and the significance of that world could be nought if they saw it from another's point of view. As for the last verse, it refers to the fact that Arthur realizes he doesn't need to continually run from place to place, he can depend on the hospitality of others as he hitchhikes through the galaxy. Seriously, read the books and you'll get a deeper meaning of what the song is about. Don't Panic.

The song poses the question of whether to hold an optomistic or pessimistic view of life.  This is generated through both the lyrics and melody.

I would classify the melody as slow and depressing (pessimistic), yet somehow it generates a feel-good response (optomistic).  Thus the question is posed.  The last line ""Oh all that I know..."" and the title ""Don't Panic"" suggest the answer is to view life with optomism. Although often ugly, one must remember life is beautiful.

@gnr-acdc-eagles 















This song, I believe, is about someone's experience with four drugs: LSD, Speed, Marijuana, and Ecstasy.
     If we start off with the mood of the song, we notice that the song is fast, happy, and even motivational in some aspects. While this is not enough to properly create the summary that the song is based off of drugs, it contributes to the theme.
     Now, if we go to the lyrical content, we see that the link between the song and drugs is pretty strong. The stanza that begins with, ""I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky/Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity..."" exemplifies the side effects that are common with the drug LSD in that strange hallucinations are being reported by whoever the song is about. Secondly, the mentioning of the drug speed is taken literally here, for Mercury sings the lines, ""I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva/I'm gonna go go go..."" He then goes into the chorus, which has lines, ""Two hundred degrees/That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit"" and, ""Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time/I'm having a ball..."" The first part of the chorus constitutes that the song's subject is ""baked"" -- a term suggesting that one under the influence of drugs is experiencing the consequences. The second part of the chorus, where he speaks of having a 'good time,' also contributes to the theme of the response to drugs. After the chorus, Mercury sings, ""Yeah, I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars/On a collision course..."" which is a nod to marijuana because it make people ""high,"" like a rocket in space. As a mention to the final drug, ecstasy, the song has the lines, ""I am a sex machine ready to reload/Like an atom bomb about to/Oh oh oh oh oh explode..."" the link here is obvious.
Overall, this song is, quite simply, about the cheerful first-person account of doing drugs.

289,Down By The Water.json,"
I think a lot of you are on the right track with picking up on the imagery the song uses, but you're taking it very literally. Rarely does a songwriter of Polly's caliber tell a story for the sake of explaining a series of events. It's almost always a conduit for something else.

I agree for the most part with idoubtthat. To take that another step further and discard as much literal translation as possible, I think it's reasonable to see the song with dualistic meanings. It could very well be about the tensions and conflicts of sexual maturation. From my standpoint, though, it's always partly been an anthem for difficult childhoods. I think that separate avenue of meaning might be where a lot of the connotations of rape and molestation people are picking up on come from.

Growing up with a difficult, inflexible mother in specific, whose love and reliability are contingent on other things and who sees any assertion of independence as an affront and a betrayal, you learn that you have to lie and disguise yourself from a very early age. When it comes to maternal ineptitude and loading responsibilities on a child, you mature very quickly in order to cope, at the cost of your innocence. You become the mother to your mother. These dysfunctional dynamics in the mother-daughter relationship are very difficult to change once they've been established. It fucks you up and it follows you into your adult life. Most people who've been forced to revoke their childhood and act as adults when they're children end up later on being prone to immaturity and longing to make up for their childhoods as adults.

There will always be some level of personal interpretation that differs from person to person, but I think we all seem to agree on the general framework that there's ambiguity and uncomfortable tension between the mother-daughter roles, this is a story about lost innocence in some form, and the loss is being lamented. From there, it's a Rorschach connect-the-dots blank canvas for ourselves, as most songs are. And who really wants to take that kind of purging self-projection away, anyhow?				
				







 
There was an error.





@jaygealousy 















I disagree with the people who are saying that maybe PJ had miscarried in the past. ""Daughter"" is symbolic as idoubtthat says. I think the daughter she is referring to is infact her younger self who was so innocent and perhaps upon losing her virginity she regrets it and yearns to return to her younger innocence (""That blue eyed girl became blue eyed whore"")

The mother/daughter theroy also fits.

@bruiseviolet 















I didn't quite interpret this the same way. I think that this song isn't necessarily an allusion to her daughter loosing her virginity and the mother wanting her little girl back, but something more direct. I think that the disturbed narrator killed her daughter; the music itself and the strain in her voice supports this idea. Also, I think that the singer is moving in and out of reality; one minute she knows that she's killed her daughter, the next, she doesn't.

""That blue-eyed girl/ Became blue-eyed whore""= This is what pushes the mother over the edge: she catches her daughter with a man.

""Just like my daughter/ See her again""= The girl that she killed is no longer the same girl as her daughter; she's disassociated the two people in her mind (living, innocent daughter vs dead, non-virginal girl). She's disturbed enough to think that the dead body merely resembles her daughter, and she's wondering when she'll get to see her daughter again (she thinks that her daughter is gone, not dead).

""I took her home""= A reference to the previous Jesus statement, she sent her daughter to heaven, away from her being a whore.

""Little fish, big fish swimming in the water/ Come back here man gimme my daughter""= Since she killed her near the river, she's returned to it, or another river. I think that as she's saying this part, she is more detached from reality. She thinks that the fish is the one who stole her daughter and she's asking him for her back. 

When I hear this song, I picture PJ sitting dirty on a river bank in the dark, rocking and staring blankly into the water, muttering at the fish to return her daughter.

@Hemsuet 















I interpret it as being about the loss of innocence... particularly when losing her virginity (whether by force or consensual). The daughter (blue-eyed girl) is symbolic of the innocent version of herself; the Mother is symbolic of herself after she looses her innocence... The ""Mother"" then longs for her innocence/innocent-self back.  

It's really a brilliant song, and there can be many ways to interpret it, as with a lot of PJ's songs. She's a great songwriter.

i think this is about a crazy woman who finds something out about her daughter and is angry at her. she gets so mad she kills her down by the water. she heard her daughter screaming and she was telling her to stop but she didn't. she takes the body home, then realises what she's done. she killed her in the water so she is askin for the fish to bring her daughter back

@dorareever 















I don't think it's from a mother to her daughter i think it's from a boy to his lover. It doesn't say in the song that the girl is the daughter of the narrator it says ""just like my daughter"" so this is what it's about; there's this guy dating this girl and they love each other a lot but somehow the girl cheats on him and that's what ""becoming a blue eyed whore""refers to.. And he has to leave her as a punishment although he loves her.. That's what i had to lose her to do her harm means.. But now he believes that she has suffered enough and just like a father always forgives her daughter he will forgive the girl.

Divorce is the worse thing that can happen to a kid. Especially when they are old enough to know what is going on. But my paents were never married and I never met my dad because he was in a different city. And my mom was working to try to support us. The song hits me the same way. They don't have to be divorced. Just saying.

@aaracelir 















yeah, it's obvious it's about two parents getting a divorce. and i'm sure it's about when it happend to his parents. to me this is the most meaningful song he's written. it's beautiful, heartfelt and true to life. 

""So its up to to you, and its up to me that we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth."" 
to me that line is about his mother, his father, and himself deciding where they should meet up so justin can go with his mother or father, depending on which one he's with at that time. it's up to him and it's up to them. 
it's at that short time when him and both of his parents are in the same place, and to him it feels like they're a normal, down to earth family. 
im probably wrong, but that's what i got out of it.

Yehh, this is the most meaningful song on the album, it's also Justin's favourite song too. Im glad this one is his favourite cos it shows his deeper side and helps everyone else understand him more too. Its pretty obvious that his past has helped turn him into the strong brave person he is today. As hard as divorce is, you have two options, you can cry and cry and cry, and give up, or do the crying, pick yourself up and battle through it. I'm glad Justin did the latter! with all that behind him, its no wonder he no longer fears easily. 

I think this kid is going to be a mega-star like MJ was.

I believe this song is about the narrator coming to the conclusion that the real world is really, a big mess. He thinks that our lives are merely dreams due to how unnaware we are about the real giant mess our world is, but as he says ""Leave me to dream"", he is admitting that he likes to live in a dream, because with that mentality, he is free to do anything he wants, to reach all his life goals, just like you can control a dream. Long story short, we want life to be a dream, because in a dream, everything is possible, in life it is just much harder.

So this song kinda touches up on modern issues. So today, we depend on the news to tell us what's happening in the world. And in this song, the ""I"" or the narrator, has seen he need and everything and believes it. Therefore, he believes the world is find. ""The colors you painted in my head"", refers to this. But the narrator soon realizes that the world is in chaos. The lies he has heard are to keep the world calm. As if they were in a dream. When in reality everything's mess.

@codfp 















Wow. This is impressive. A song so simple and that doesn't state it's direct meaning, but has 3 main meanings and a 4th possible implied one.
Protected Childhood
Not being Aware of World Problems
Not being Prepared for the Real World
And of all things: Imagination

I'm not going to do this line by line because the song is so fractured, but here we go.

(Protected Childhood)

And I watch from a distance seventeen
In the eyes - Of a teenage crystallized
Oh the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
We have the curtains drawn and closed
'It’s not what you painted in my head - We all are living in a dream - But life ain’t what it seems'
Oh, I know all your reasons - To keep me from seeing - Everything is actually a mess
But now I am leaving

'Distance 17' is an age. The age of 18 is when most people are considered adults and can live on their own. It's the minimum age a child is supposed to be protected till, or ""distance"" in this case. So it means ""I couldn't really see for 17 years.""
'In the eyes - Of a teenage crystallized' and 'Oh the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home'  Means that he had a nice home or was rich because this implies chandlers or colored light fixtures.
'We have the curtains drawn and closed'  They don't look outside or more specifically, aren't bothered by it. Whether because they don't look out or this child isn't allowed to look out is personal preference.
'It’s not what you painted in my head - We all are living in a dream - But life ain’t what it seems'  Easy meanings. ""Life isn't what is what I though it was""
'Oh, I know all your reasons - To keep me from seeing - Everything is actually a mess'  It's that child saying, ""You didn't want me to see the problems of life, and I know why. This is horrible."" The child saw what it had been protected from.
'But now I am leaving'  The child is saying ""I'm 18 now, and i have to live with these problems.

Not being Aware of World Problems

OK, most of the lines from before apply here too
'And the cries from the strangers out at night - They don’t keep us up at night - We have the curtains drawn and closed'
'It’s not what you painted in my head - We all are living in a dream - But life ain’t what it seems'
'To keep me from seeing - Everything is actually a mess'
'All of us were only dreaming'
'I’m just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface'

'It’s not what you painted in my head - We all are living in a dream - But life ain’t what it seems'  They hold the same meaning as with childhood.
'And the cries from the strangers out at night - They don’t keep us up at night - We have the curtains drawn and closed'  ""We don't care about other peoples problems so we ignore them.""
'To keep me from seeing - Everything is actually a mess'  Also holds same meaning
'All of us were only dreaming'  ""I/We were stupid for thinking life was easy.""
'I’m just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface'  This is a beautiful line, while it has no meaning the first time, in context to the song it means ""This is the first challenges and problems, I know there's more I haven't considered""

Not being Prepared for the Real World

I won't repeat the same lines again
'In the dark'
'And I’m short of the others dreams of being golden and on top'
'In the dark'  He doesn't know what to do. He's never had to do this before.
'And I’m short of the others dreams of being golden and on top'  This means ""I'm not where I wanted to be by now."" it could also show that he had friends or competitors that are doing better that him, but started at the same time as him.

Not those are the Pretty much directly stated meaning. I didn't go too in-depth because the song it have no solid details. It's a trademark of Imagine Dragons that lets you make your own meanings and put your life problems to their songs, but it make direct meanings near impossible to find most of the time. I say this because this next part may not truly be a meaning or could just be something only I understand.

Imagination

'It’s not what you painted in my head'
'There’s so much there instead of all the colors that I saw'
'But I wanna dream - I wanna dream - Leave me to dream'

'It’s not what you painted in my head'  This on it's own means ""It's not what I expected"" but instead think about it as ""It’s not what I imagined""
Not I want to point out the interesting wording on these 2 lines.
'Painted in my head' and 'Colors that I saw'
You use colors in painting and if painting in the first line is means Imagination, then the second line could mean ""There’s so much there instead of all that I Imagined'
They both boil down to ""It’s not what I imagined""

But there's one more part to this meaning. 'There’s so much there instead'
The 'There' it could be referring to could be the 'Head' from the first line.
The true question I'm asking is is what does the guy think is in his head if it's not imagination. Knowledge? Lies? I don't know, but look at the last lines.

'But I wanna dream - I wanna dream - Leave me to dream'
'I wanna dream - I wanna dream - Leave me to dream'
In the other part of the song the word 'Dream' has been used to mean ""Wrong"" But that doesn't work here. in these 2 lines Replace the word 'Dream' with ""Imagine""
He's saying he doesn't want to deal with the worlds problems. He wants to imagine, or create, or maybe I'm completely over-analyzing and he's asking to live his life in ignorance of the worlds problems. And to leave him let him do that in peace.

In my opinion this song is a commentary on society and how people live their lives. He comments on how people care about "" being golden and on top."" He also comments on how we sugar coat our problems (poverty for example) and ignore them ""The cries for strangers in the night don't keep us up at night we have the curtains drawn closed"".
And then he says he wants to be left to dream and leave the mess and sorrows society has left for him.

I think it is about a recently graduated high schooler's view of life. He thinks he's not ready for what's about to come, to live alone without his parents that had he living in a 'dream'. He is aware of what's coming and he feels scared, so he wants to keep living in the 'dream', where his parents take care of him and he doesn't need to worry about anything.

I believe that this song is about how people just pass off that the world is just a complete mess.  That there are people starving, drying, and living on the streets.  That this ""dream"" is what we believe the world is happy and dreamlike. He wants to stay in the dream,  he doesn't want to face the world,  he'd rather dream that everything is okay.

I was at the debut concert for the Smoke+Mirrors tour last night, and Dan talked about how for him personally, this song was about living with health problems (he spoke about his night blindness, ulcerative colitis, etc) - and presumably about pursuing his goals and shaping his world the way he dreams it could be in spite of them.

As for the wider, more general meaning, I would go with pedro5qd's interpretation.

* sigh* ok here we go...

This song makes me cry whenever I hear it...

To me, this song is about someone realizing the world is actually a mess
Their parents did their best to protect them from the evil in the world, they created a ""dream"" world for the person ""the crys, from the strangers out at night, they don't keep us up at night, we have the curtains drawn and closed ""

As this person grows up, they realize that everything wasn't as they thought, ""We are all living in a dream""

They decide they don't want to live in a world with this evil.. They just want to stay in the world their parents created for them ""i wanna dream, I wanna dream, leave me to dream""

I have an invisible chronic illness and this song hits me on a deep level. I always dreamt of this stage of my life and instead I have depression, pain, and I never leave the house. I often find myself imagining what life would be like if I had not had this burden. I also imagine the future if I am cured of this. I lie in bed and I have to force myself to get up and face the reality that is my life now. I wish I could always dream and imagine because it is my form of hope. I hate this reality and I don't want to accept that ""everything is actually a mess."" This song hits really close to home. That's just what it means to me.

""Drink a Beer"" is a song written by Jim Beavers and Chris Stapleton, and recorded by American country music singer Luke Bryan. It was released in November 2013 as the third single from his fourth studio album, Crash My Party. Bryan has described ""Drink a Beer"" as ""the coolest sad song ever"" and, despite not having a hand in writing it, connects with the story after having lost both of his siblings.[1] He dedicated his performance of the song at the CMA Awards on November 6, 2013 to his late siblings Chris and Kelly

This is probably my favorite Halsey song, not just because of her bombastic voice or soundscape, but because the lyrics struck a chord with me. 
In her relationship, all they do is drive and enjoy each other's company, even though they both know they have feelings for each other. They are both scared to make the first move, waiting for a sign. Perhaps they were both so distracted by their thoughts and feelings that they missed their sign/exit, and now they're stuck driving down that road again with no deviation from their path. 

""It's so simple, but we can't stay""
It's simple to say the words ""I love you"" to each other, but they both know it wouldn't work out. 

""Over-analyze again"" 
Overthinking relationships (is this friendship? more? one-sided?) is easy, and it's easy to become impatient when one or both people are doing this. 

""Would it really kill you if we kissed?""
Impatience and frustration is inevitable in a slow-burning relationship. Halsey is expressing a need for this person to just take a risk and make a move. It would make her vulnerable, but there's a chance it would resolve the tension and she could feel at home again.

I believe that you all misheard lyrics...

I found these lyrics, they are correct. :)


Demolition of bodies, smashed and broken, piles of guts, moist and steaming
Tendons severing, brains are boiling, unburied corpses in state of decay
Rotten limbs start to ferment, torso's torn in two
Skin ripped off to expose muscle tissue, butchered for human stew
Crawl into the cadaver head first, eat your way through the guts
The purgent smell of decaying innards is enough to drive you nuts
The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your mouth
As you chew on the piss filled kidney's
Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving nothing but bones
Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of death fill the air
Bones sticking out, ripped from sockets, blood spurting everywhere
Victim lying dead, neck but no head, smearing remains on your own face
Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of death fill the air

Blistering flesh, another death, stiffened bones, morbid groans
Evil mind, brain oozing slime, feel the pain
Body weak brain contorting, fluid flowing from your organs
Veins torn our, Mangled
Festering flesh, quivering cadaver, ligaments stretched around your own neck
Drink the pus, Mangled
Severed dick, bloody bowels, the gutted corpse now lies hollow
Feeding on feces, Mangled
Amputated arms, crushing legs, head is ripped right off your shoulders
Thrown in a pile, Mangled
Limbs rearranged, head on backwards a humongous heap of twisting flesh
Sewn together, Mangled - Mangled

His knife plunges in your cold battered body
Blood seeping through, the jagged wounds he cuts
Unbearable pain, give into death
Your life slips away, perish in blood

Menacing madman mutilating
Destroying, disfiguring, dead you'll be
Crushing, cracking, killing you
Annihilation, desecration

Born through modern day science
Man has made his last mistake
A creature so hideously horrible
Leaving nothing to waste
Evil has a new face, a mangled horrible face
His views are those of death, nothing will stop his lust

Slicing victims left to decay, listening to their mortal cries
Unhuman, immortal, bestial, now he owns your soul
Crawl into the cadaver head first, eat your way through the guts
The pungent smell of decaying innards is enough to drive you nuts
The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your mouth
As you chew on the piss filled kidney's
Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving nothing but bones

Human converted to beast, the perfect killing machine
Psychotic structure of brain tissue, murder his only memory
Dependant on death, crushing your head, I'm addicted to blood
Chew the decay



The weakened man must die, tearing out his insides
Smashing all the bones, hear his tormenting groans

"
310,Eleanor Rigby.json,"
I think this song is simple.

Two lonely people--Eleanor Rigby and Father McKenzie--are the subjects.

Eleanor Rigby lives in a pretend world that she made for herself because she is so lonely and unknown--she goes into a church building after a stranger's wedding is over and grabs the rice to throw, pretending she's getting married. When she goes home, she sits by the window and smiles out, either hoping to grab someone's attention or pretending she has (""Who is it for?"").

Father McKenzie is a preacher that is probably used primarily for wedding services and his actual preaching isn't really well-attended. He spends all night fixing up his clothes to look good for a sermon no one will go to (""What does he care?"").

In the finale, Eleanor has finally died, leaving nothing but her name (which is on the tombstone), and McKenzie was the one who buried her (because a burial is done with hands and a shovel, he got dirt on them and wipes it off). Because nobody came to her funeral, no one was ""saved"" by the sermon he had planned for her.


That's the story--as to its meaning, it may simply be a lament for all the people in the world that have no one.

Though it is one of my favorite songs I always feel a bit uncomfortable hearing it. 
It always seemed to me as if the lines ""All the lonely people, where do they all come from? All the lonely people, where do they all belong?"" implicate on the listeners and accuse them of being a part of a cold and inhumane society.

I've had an inspiration about the meaning of this song and joined specifically so I could share my inspiration. I have not read all the comments because there are a lot but I read most of them and none of you got this. A few hinted at it but none of you got this.

I'm going to come right out and say that this song was directed at the church. This song was directed at Christianity in general. Singing about Father McKenzie was not singing about a random individual who happened to be a church leader. For the purpose of this song, Father McKenzie =IS= the representation of Christianity. ""Ah, look at all the lonely people"" and ""No one was saved"".

Yes, there is a hint of a connection between Father McKenzie and Eleanor Rigby. But the song is not saying that they did anything together. The two might never have even spoken outside of the usual church banter. What the song is suggesting is that there should have been more of a connection between Father McKenzie and Eleanor Rigby. But ""No one was saved"" because Father McKenzie was too busy being self-righteous, too busy ""writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear."" This song is a bold-faced accusation against the self-righteous and overly religious that refuse to reach out to the all the lonely people and then wonder why so few come to church.

This song is saying that it isn't enough to be friendly. This song is saying that as long as people, especially religious people, remain cold and aloof, the Eleanor Rigby's of this world will continue to die and be ""buried along with her name"". A person's name is very important in Judeo-Christian values.

This sounds crazy, but I'm a great fan of Dickens, and whenever I hear this song, I think of Miss Havisham. Especially at the beginning part of it. To all who are unaquainted with Miss Havisham, she is a character in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations (a very good novel, by the way.) She was jilted on her wedding day as a young girl, and her heart was broken. She stopped all of the clocks in her house at the time she was jilted, shut up all the windows, and left everything just as it was. As an old lady, she sits in her wedding dress and veil, the wedding feast still sitting out, rotten, in the dining room, and meanwhile exacts her revenge on men with her beautiful, unattainable adopted daughter, Estella. Eleanor Rigby's lonliness and her constant sort of waiting state always bring Miss Havisham to mind. So there! By reading this post you got one bibliophile's strange opinion and a literature lesson all in one!

I think Father McKenzie and Eleanor were meant to be together but never were. Two lonely people who could have been together. She was frequenting the church where he worked and he was the only one who attended her funeral. He came as a friend because he picked up dirt to throw over her. It's sad because if you are a lonely person, you never know how close you may be to someone else who is lonely.

This is obviously a song about lonely people. It seems that Eleanor Rigby was a lonely single person, she often went to Church, perhaps to ease the emptiness that she felt inside, maybe she even hoped to make friends there. Whilst in Church perhaps she saw the rice left over from other peoples' weddings, and often regretted that she had never had the chance to get married or have a family. 

""Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door"", suggests that like most lonely people, she hid her unhappiness whenever she left the house and tried to appear happy like everybody else. ""Window"" and ""Jar"" suggests that her outward attempts to hide her unhappiness didn't work very well and was easy to see through, as both windows and jars are glass.

""Died in the church"" perhaps relates to the last place she visited before she passed away, perhaps she was even found dead inside the church, either from natural causes or maybe even suicide.

""Buried along with her name"" seems to indicate that she was the last of her family, having no relatives, siblings or children of her own to continue the family bloodline, maybe she was the last remaining ""Rigby"" from her family circle and nobody left to carry the surname on.

In the UK it is a tradition that when people are buried for the closest relative(s) to throw a handful of dirt into the grave before it is filled in. Because Eleanor had no relatives or friends at her graveside, Father Mackenzie felt sorry for her, and decided to do it, hence ""Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave""

""No one was saved"" perhaps sums up how Father Mackenzie feels, nobody comes to his Church, all he does is bury people and he has had no opportunity to help anybody with their problems or feel like he has played a part in bettering somebody else's life. Perhaps Eleanor was so lonely that she committed suicide in the Church which would also be an alternative to ""Died in the Church"", and also why Father Mackenzie feels guilty at not being in the Church to talk to her and try to stop her from killing herself.

@turbo1973 















I really love this song and being a philosophy minor makes me love it even more.  I think the Beatles are pointing out where all this unhappiness comes from.  First off, E.R is most likely a nun or janitor (picking up rice) who wants to get closer to F.M, but because of Catholicism they can't be together (implementing religion for unhappiness).  Also, the next part about wearing a face in a jar by the door is referring to makeup worn to give the illusion of happiness or just putting on a front whenever in public to try to be happy like everyone else, but it turns out there are truly many unhappy people (so society as well).  The next part about writing words that no one will hear, has to do with F.M who is trying to help others but he can't even help himself because of a religion that is supposed to make life better, but is doing the opposite ""No-one comes near"" and "" a sermon no one will hear.""  However, in spite of this he still blindly works hard at something that is a lost cause, ""darning his socks.""  He is trying, but not really thinking because if he was than he would realize how unhappy he is and change his path in life. The last part about E.R dying gives a truthful yet sad example of what the outcome and future holds; E.R never married ""buried along with her name"" and I might be reading into it too much, but ""she,"" not in a physical sense, but in a “self” sense died before her body did as a result of the church.  Also the last lines about F.M ""wiping the dirt from his hands"" is almost like he is once again not reflecting on what has happened and blindly following something that has led to such anguish.  I think this song says a lot about the Beatles views on religion and we can't really dispute all of this...............

@Goose 















I remember walking through the halls of my Juinor High school, years back, with hundreds of people bumping and pushing, and thinking: ""i wonder how many times i've seen these same people, and yet i've still never seen them before, i'm seeing them for the first time.""

That's what this is about. Walking down the halls, you see all kinds of people, and everyone is there with a purpose. But you, just walking to class, are the lonliest, like a fish bowl, you are only a spektator. 

I think the lines ""Father McKenzie, writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear"" and ""[Eleanor Rigby] waits at the window, wearing a face she keeps in a jar by the door"" are the most meaning full. The first one is like all the things you hear, and see, and that maybe someone has spent time working on, and you will never really see it, or remember it. The second one is like when you have a job where 'the costomer is always right,' and you always have to smile even though you don't have a need to, or you don't want to. It's pretty depressing trying to live life impressing others. I get this image of someone sitting in a run down, dark room looking out a window, which is a rather depressing scene, and the door bell rings. So she gets up and greets her guests with a surprised greeting and a smile. But then she goes back to sitting in her chair, looking out her gloomy window.

@ME68 I really love your opening lines in this response, and it really caused me to think. The truthfulness of this is awe-inspiring, and it makes me think of how anyone could dress themselves up and put on a face (""wearing a face she keeps in a jar by the door""), but you never really KNOW anyone until you speak with them for a while and can get a sense of them. The face, the mask, that one can put on can hide someone's bold soul, and lonely people have a bad habit of putting on that mask. 

Every day at school, I get this same feeling as you, as if there are so many souls that I have never gotten the chance to know or talk to. All I see as I walk down the hallway, my music blaring in my ears, are faces. Smiling faces, frowning faces, laughing faces, faces that are covered by someone else's, all of which I have never really seen. One of my goals in life is to be able to ""see"" as many people's faces as possible.

Thank you for making me think about this!

Most incomprehensible lyrics ever.  So why is it so great?  I don't know.  It's been my favorite U2 song since I heard it, but I still can't figure out any semblance of meaning for it.  The best I can figure is by the song title and various scraps - it's the love-hate relationship between teacher and student, or child and fallen hero; a tie of respect and admiration that is strained over and over, but is only strengthened by the pain.

The song's best quality is its smoothness.  No other song I know of uses the flow of music and song like a twisting summer breeze in quite this way (Think Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"" or Dire Straits' ""Brothers in Arms"" for this category).  The song just melts into your brain like an epic poem, and the words are just soothing chants that you're not meant to understand, with the occasionally perceptible utterance of a spine-tingling phrase like ""Ah, don't talk to me"" or ""You're through with me, but I know that you'll be back for more"" or ""Your heart is left out from the side.""  And they're all whispered in Bono's most introspective of voices, and you know it's personal for him, and that makes it so touching.  It's as if each sentence is a self-spoken prayer overheard in a deserted church.

This has been one of my fav u2 songs of all time.

From what I can recall... the reason the lyrics are hard to understand is there are no lyrics for this song. Apparently Bono was singing lyrics off the top of his head (or from partially completed lyrics) while facing a large painting of Elvis. 

u2 did not like this song but Brian Eno urged the fellows to put it on the album arguing that the song captured a great mood.

This song is perfect to play on a cold, grey, rainy day.

I don't think this is the weakest song on the album. I think its the most original from the rest, actually.  It's unlike the other tracks on the CD in its construction and lyrcis (the music is A Sort of Homecoming slowed down and played backwards) and there are no lyrics (Bono is addlibbing), at first this was my least favorite on the album as well. But new music requires new ways of listening to it. You can't approach listening to this song the same way you do the rest of the album. Its total mood. Play it on a chilly, drizzling, overcast morning.

I believe the lyric should be ""like you never seen"", not ""like he never seen"". The idea is that the people who watched Elvis on TV in those early days were shocked by his gyrations.  They called him ""Elvis the pelvis"".  Elvis might have gotten some of his dance moves from watching black R&B artists perform.  Elvis had seen it all. So, it's not ""like he never seen"".  It's ""like you never seen"".

It's ""he was all alone in a long decline"", not ""he was all alone in a long dead climb"".  Elvis was fat, isolated and addicted to all kinds of drugs.  He was in a long decline.

			On the contrary, I think it is ""like he'd never seen"", as I believe the song is about Welch's admiration for this ""country boy"", who came out of nowhere and changed the face of music, shaking it (in every sense) like ""a chorus girl...like a Harlem queen"", even though he had never seen those things. 

I think it is celebrating the inspirational nature of Elvis Presley, that somebody so amazing can come out of nowhere, out of nothing, not out of some Fame School X-Factor academy or production line. 

This song is incredible, and one of my favourite songs ever. The recording is beautiful, and the delicacy of the vocals on ""he rang like silver"" is breath-taking, and I love them singing ""Oh bless my soul, what's wrong with me?"" in such a mournful way, in complete contrast to how Elvis sang it, but emphasising his fragility on the inside, despite being such a huge icon worldwide on the outside.

thanks jweyek for that correction on „decline”. Imo that is key to the song. As contrasted to John Henry who died in his finest moment, Elvis had a long and lonely decline to his death. That is sad.
and thanks FishesWillLaugh, I agree - Gillian must really admire and understand the phenomenon that Elvis was. I don’t, but hearing the song and reading your explanations I am getting the feel for it.

I just love the second part of this song (starting from ""Did you ever walk up to the edge of a cliff""); it's such a beautiful allegory for taking risks and having to decide between what may seem the logical solution and what you feel is the solution YOU NEED. If you take that final step you either win everything or lose it all - it depends on your luck. 

And also, I see TSO came back to a theme they sang about in ""What Is Eternal"": which actions/thoughts/images decide the nature of a person, in the end? ""From Eternity's view"", is he the man he used to be, or the reformed version of himself? Which one really matters?

Their songs might have a bit too much pathos; (or sometimes sound downright cheesy); but damn, I love them anyway!

If you have an anti-Christian bias, then this song will be about Jesus to you. However, ""get off your fuckin cross"" refers to anyone who is playing the part of the martyr for the attention, of which there have been hundreds since Christ. Also, Christ was not surprised to hear his own eulogy, he prophesied it and talked about it frequently, and even stated it was his purpose to die. So, I don't think it's about Jesus. One thing I love about Tool is their songs make people think.. well some of them anyways... if all you can do is bash Christians that doesn't take a lot of brainpower, just repeat what you hear in the media. However, for those of us who have a truly open mind rather than an empty mind filled with nonsense... just hit play.

@Christianscanbemetalheads2 

I think it's definitely about Jesus. He is dead? Christians claim he is the living god, and that he rose from the dead and is currently in heaven. I think the fact that he is telling him to die, is due to the fact that Christ himself said he would die. And that he said he would die for all of us. So if he doesn't die for us, that means he lied, and that he hasn't done what he said he would for us. Hence, ""would you die for me? Don't you fucking lie."" 
And I'm sorry, this is off subject, but we live in the fattest nation in the world, yet one of the only things that outnumbers our McDonalds is tax exempt churches... Come on, you're not oppressed. Last I saw, roughly 3/4 of Americans are Christians, too.

@Christianscanbemetalheads2 I agree. I don't think it's about Christ. That would be too simplistic. Tool is much to complex for that. Plus, the resurrection of Christ in no way implicates that he didn't die. It only means he didn't stay dead.

@Christianscanbemetalheads2 It's not about Jesus, God, or anything to do with religion. Maynard is singing about the death of one's EGO. When you have a spiritual awakening you slowly kill your ego it's a very fucked up process and you actually do feel like you have died. ""To ascend you must die"" Ascend meaning  Awakening or having Christ Consciousness. Still nothing to do with Jesus Christ Christ consciousness is a metaphor for awakening. But it's music so it really doesn't matter what the song means as long as it raises your vibration in a positive matter and makes yo have a positive outlook on life. Hail Satan.

@Christianscanbemetalheads2 I agree he's using the way Jesus Christ claimed He would die for everyone's sins, and then died as an example only. Any other martyrs who stand on soapboxes pointing fingers in the world after the Crucifixion of Christ claiming to be better or know better than everyone else especially if they fail to speak from the heart with humility as Jesus did, had better be prepared to put their money where their mouth is and make a similar sacrifice to the public they want to believe them. He's mocking them using Jesus as an ideal or example to hold them up against, not mocking Jesus himself. 

@Cani687 if really doesn't make sense to be about Jesus himself. Jesus knew He would die for our sins, prophesied it even. He was meant to do it and when the time came welcomed it knowingly. These specific lyrics I think show he's talking about someone who wants to be a martyr but falls short of Jesus's example:

""Not all martyrs see divinity but at least you tried"" (Jesus saw divinity)

""Ranting and pointing his finger at everything but his heart"" (Jesus did speak from the heart)

""Get off your fucking cross. We need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr"" (Jesus sadly didn't get off his cross, but people who martyr themselves pontify to the public putting themselves up on a cross. He's mocking them for not seeing their own public demise coming.)

So he's not mocking Jesus, rather using His example as an ideal to hold televangelists, politicians, public figures, to mockingly. Many of Tool's songs and themes are about calling out blatant and insidious hypocrisy.

			I've heard somewhere that it's about L. Ron Hubbard. Interesting and valid point you brought up about Jesus. If the song was about Jesus, it wouldn't make any sense.  			

			I created a songmemanings account stricly so that I could reply to this post. I could not agree more with your statements. Thank you for communicating this concept so well. 


@Christianscanbemetalheads2 

I think it's definitely about Jesus. He is dead? Christians claim he is the living god, and that he rose from the dead and is currently in heaven. I think the fact that he is telling him to die, is due to the fact that Christ himself said he would die. And that he said he would die for all of us. So if he doesn't die for us, that means he lied, and that he hasn't done what he said he would for us. Hence, ""would you die for me? Don't you fucking lie.""

This song isn't about religion.  It uses religion as a metaphor to get the information across.  This song refers to someone who thinks they are better than everyone else.  It emphasizes the trust that people take in others or the lack of it.  Tool is not a religous band.  By this I mean they don't promote their beliefs to try and persuade others to think the same.  They want everyone to be their own person and not conform to the ""usual"" because that's the way it was done in the past.

The idea of the martyr is metaphorical. The tone is sarcastic, and at the same time grudgingly true. If you read carefully, no one dies. The miss him is that the recipient of the ""Eulogy"" has stepped down from his cross or pulpit.


He had a lot of nothing to say
We'll miss him
We'll miss him
We're gonna miss him
We're gonna miss him>

The set up. A person who talks a lot, but what he talks about has now import or merit (""a lot of nothing to say""). Followed up with the refrain ""We'll miss him""... he isn't here anymore, and the sarcasm is immediate, since the line ""We'll miss him"" immediately follows ""He had a lot of nothing to say"".


We wish you well
You told us how you weren't afraid to die
Well then, so long
Don't cry.
Or feel too down
Not all martyrs see divinity
But at least you tried>

The speaker speaks for some group that the eulogized was a part of. They are sending him off with a ""eulogy"", but he is not dead. ""Don't cry."" Don't cry refers to the eulogized and not the group. The group ""We"" is wishing a the eulogized ""you"" well. The martyrdom the speaker refers to seems to be how the eulogized must have spoken of and attempted to represent some ideal, the ""divinity"", but couldn't actually realize or perhaps even follow this ideal (the martyr that fails to see divinity).


He had a voice that was strong and loud
We'll miss him
We'll miss him
Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart
We'll miss him
We'll miss him
We're gonna miss him
We're gonna miss him>

Here is the real beef the speaker has with the eulogized. The person seemed persuasive and showed conviction, but in the end, the eulogized only pointed fingers, in essence, blaming and finding fault, but not with himself. Again the refrain of ""we'll miss him"", maybe they will miss his theatrics, but the sarcasm is fully there. The speaker points out the negative of the eulogized, and follows with ""we'll miss him"".


What it was that you had said to me,
Like I care at all>

Another mention of how the song's target had nothing of merit to say.


You sure could yell
You took a stand on every little thing
And so loud>

This sort of paints the eulogized as being so self-delusional as to be a lunatic, ranting about everything, but not in any meaningful way.


He had a voice so strong and loud and I
Swallowed his faï¿½ade 'cause I'm so
Eager to identify with
Someone above the ground,
Someone who seemed to feel the same,
Someone prepared to lead the way, with
Someone who would die for me>

And now for heart of it. This points to the speaker's ultimate disillusionment of the eulogized. The speaker believed what the target had to say, because he was under sway of the eulogized person's charisma. He was a voice above the crowd, he stood out. The speaker was eager to identify, as he had similar feelings. It could even be assumed that the eulogized person tapped into the speaker's and others' feelings and sentiments, focused their dissatisfaction, and intimated that he ""would die for me"". In other words, this eulogized person, by speaking to and for the crowd, persuaded them that he felt as they did, that he was a part of them, and that he would make sacrifices for them. This, of course, was a lie. A facade is a false face.


Would you die for me?
Don't you fucking lie

Don't you step out of line
Don't you step out of line
Don't you step out of line
Don't you fucking lie>

The sarcasm is replaced with anger. By saying ""don't step out of line"" and ""don't lie"", this has already been done. The eulogized DID step out of line with what he said. He did lie.


Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own eulogy?>

You said you would make whatever sacrifice, the sacrifice is your death, and yet you are surprised. The speaker is telling the eulogized that he is dead to the group now, the sacrifice is his role in the group. But the eulogized man is surprised by this. This was not intended, even though he kept claiming that he was a part of them, and that he would ""die"" for them, make whatever sacrifice. He never intended to make any sacrifice.


You had a lot of nothing to say

Come down
Get off your fucking cross
We need the fucking space to nail the next fool martyr>

Get off the cross. A metaphor that people are tired of hearing the martyr attitude, the woe-is-me. Perhaps here, the nailing of the martyr to the cross was forcing the eulogized person to publicly suffer for the group, some sort of calling out or shaming, and now get the hell out of here. You're dead to us.


You must be crucified
For our sins and our lies
Goodbye... >

The speaker is telling the eulogized that he had promised to sacrifice, that in order to be the true martyr he made himself out to be, he NEEDED to make a sacrifice, so the group made him, perhaps not in the way that he intended, and his use is over to the group.

One could make the case that the speaker is subtly angry at himself and the group as well. He makes mention how he wanted to believe, how the group will miss the eulogized (perhaps missing a martyr, as they need that), and does make mention ""for our sins and our lies"". Still, he may be saying that last line as a way of throwing it back into the eulogized man's face.

So to recap. The eulogy is for a living man, a man who could hear his own eulogy. A eulogy is supposed to be about the deceased person's merits, but this is about a non-deceased person's ultimate failings. The ""goodbye"" is the group forcibly sending someone off and away from them.

@JohnnyApocalypse very nice ""translated"" but when i hear that song, it makes me think about my dad that died almost 3 years ago... i have growed older and been more mature now and when i think back we had a good relationship even tho we dident speak alot togehter... i smoked weed everyday and when i came home at night he was always up watching tv... i dident look him in the eye, i only said hello and looked down at our dog for a min just so he couldent look me in the eye when i stepped inside the back door... and then after that i walked straight into my room.. ""He had alot to say.. he had alot of nothing to say"" he wanted to say alot of things to me but he dident say anything of those things he really wanted to say.. like a real farther- son talk.. telling me not to smoke everyday,.. and telling me that im not aloud to smoke weed inside my room(my room was just next to the living room)... so im pretty sure that he could smell the weed cus i had only a very little window..his mom and dad died very early. when he was about 21 both his parrents was dead so he dident learn much from them about taking care of a kid i guess..but now when i think back he learned me alot of things, but just on his own wierd way, i see him as a ""hero"" just by guessing what he ment by not saying those ""dad"" things to me.....  he learned me what not to do when i get a kid and some how he learned me what to do and most of all to be fair to all ppl... thank you dad for being the best dad you could be

327,Everybody Dies in Their Nightmares.json,nil
328,"Everybody's Gonna Have a Wonderful Time Up There [Gospel Boogie, Take.json",nil
329,Everything.json,"
The song's meaning in a nutshell:

You are rare, unique, and beautiful (You're a fallen star).  You are the one who gets me out of trouble (You're the getaway car).  You are the one who keeps me from transgressing the appropriate boundaries (You're the line in the sand/When I go too far).  You are the one who gives me relief from my discomfort and my problems (You're the swimming pool/On an August day).  You are the one who makes me feel like I'm intelligent and clever (And you're the perfect thing to say).

You pretend that you are less than the amazing girl that you are, but deep down you know better.  I find this very attractive.  You can tell how I feel about you and how much I love you.  You know the affect that merely being who you are has on me.  You can see this in my eyes (And you play it coy/But it's kinda cute/Oh when you smile at me/You know exactly what you do/Baby don't pretend/That you don't know it's true/'Cause you can see it when I look at you).

You are fun to be around and make me feel like a kid again (You're a carousel).  You make me feel hopeful about the future (You're a wishing well).  You turn me on and make me feel good about myself (And you'll light me up/When you ring my bell).  You are someone that, regardless of your wonderful qualities, I admit that I do not fully understand.  Because of this you intrigue me and captivate my attention all the more. (You're a mystery/You're from outer space).  I think about you all the time and I care more about you than anything else (You're every minute of my everyday).

It is unbelievable, given who you are, that you love me too.  That I get to be together with you (And I can't believe that I'm your man/And I get to kiss you baby just because I can).  Our love is so strong, so deep, so powerful, that any problem we have in the future can be overcome (Whatever comes our way/We'll see it through/And you know that's what our love can do).

These are tough times.  Times that tend to make one not feel special, not feel unique, not feel in control, not know what one's limits are, not feel safe, not feel intelligent, not feel hopeful, not feel that one is able to relax and have fun, not feel excited, not feel able to connect to the mystery of life, not feel like one is able to have something to which one should dedicate oneself. (And in this crazy life/And through these crazy times)  It is my love for you that gives meaning and purpose to my life.  This song that I sing, all the songs that I sing, every line I say, every word I utter, all that I am is imbued, is inspired, is made wonderful by you.  You are the real song and the song that I am singing and its words are merely a reflection of you.  It is you, who you are, that is the greatest thing in the world.  My song is merely my attempt to ""sing along,"" to join in revealing the incomparable person that you are and the transforming affect that you have on my life (It's you, it's you/You make me sing/You're every line/You're every word/You're everything/You're every song/And I sing along/'Cause you're my everything).

337,FaceTime.json,nil
338,Fade To Black.json,"
My son was only 15 Â½ years old in 1997 when his father died of heart disease just before Christmas.  At the time, he was learning to play an acoustic guitar.  Soon after his father‘s death, he discovered “Metallica” and “Fade to Black”.   For weeks, I could hear him (alone in his room), learning to play “Fade to Black “.  It didn’t take him very long.  “Fade to Black” played by a grieving teenager on an acoustic guitar is music straight from the heart. 

The lyrics of “Fade to Black”, more than likely, have different meanings for different people.   For my son, I believe the lyrics of “Fade to Black” are about grieving and learning about one’s own mortality.   

“Life it seems will fade away, Drifting further every day” - Realizing people WILL & DO die!  And, that someday you will die too!

“Getting lost within myself, Nothing matters, no one else” - Dealing with one’s own feelings about the loss of someone they love deeply.

“I have lost the will to live, Simply nothing more to give” - Not wanting to go on living without the one you loved, if it means continuing to feel almost unbearable sadness.

“There is nothing more for me” - Thinking you will never be able to enjoy living again without your loved one in your life.

“Need the end to set me free” - Thinking you will feel this way for the rest of your life.

“Things are not what they used to be, Missing one inside of me” - Not feeling like the same person you were before you lost the person who was a part of who you were.. and missing them.

“Deathly lost, this can't be real, Cannot stand this hell I feel.  Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony” - Wanting your mind to deny that your loved one has died, then facing reality and knowing it  is true and feeling agonizingly sad and lonely.

“Growing darkness taking dawn, I was me, but now He's gone” - Looking toward the future, knowing you will be a different person because the person you loved was part of who you were and is now gone.

“No one but me can save myself, but its too late.  Now I can't think, think why I should even try” - Knowing it is up to yourself to go on without your loved one, but not sure you can.

“Yesterday seems as though it never existed.” - Trying to remember how you felt before your loved one died.  

“Death Greets me warm,” - Feeling dead even though you are still alive.

“Now I will just say good-bye” - The most uplifting part of the lyrics. Being able to say “Goodbye” to your loved one and go on living without him or her.

Christmas 1999 (2 years after my husband died), I bought my son a Kirk Hemmett electric guitar and amp system.  Anyone hearing him play “Fade to Black” would think Metallica was in the house!  In my mind, my son is the greatest guitar player the world will NEVER hear!  And when I hear him play “Fade to Black“,  I know he is remembering his father.

Well this song was acually was inspired by when someone stole the band's equipment, but the song is about suicide and Metallica has gotten thousands of fan letters from people who decided not to kill themselves becuase of this song. This is one of my favorite songs.

Fade to Black would've been written 2 or 3 years before his death.


			The song's so awesome it makes it worth live just to listen to it.			

It says in the biography of metallica that it the lyrics were made from the last words of a confessional of a suicide victim.  I got this straight from  Metallica Unbound, which is a biography written by a close friend of James. I personally love the song and the lyrics are good to listen to when your going through rough times.

Jesus H Christ!!!!!! We all know that this song is about suicide, but what every one should be talking about is the whole deep down meaning behind the lyrics. This song ain't just about suicide, it's about expressing the thoughts of someone who is thinking about killing himself. A man who is lost in himself and not in the real world. Everybody thinks about suicide when the outside world is beating you down. This is about his own self beating him down and he doesn't know how to cope with it. The lyrics really get inside of the head of a sad and lonely man who lives only in his own head and cannot deal with his own insanity and finds the one true way out. Suicide. Damn people look a little bit deeper into the lyrics and what they are saying to you.

""Growing darkness taking dawn, I was me but now He's gone.""  - I think that's such a beautiful lyric and a great way for Jaymz to illustrate the change that has occured in him.  
to Metallican41:  I think you should think before you type especially on a mesage board full of Metallica fans, because you saying that their lyrics are weak is the most ignorant thing I've heard in a while.  Unless you're a 13 year old TRL watching kid and the only Metallica songs you know are the ones they play on the radio and MTV late at night, then I can see why you'd say that their lyrics are not dense.  It's easy for someone who doesn't really know Metallica to make that generalization, but in reality Metallica has some of the most thought-provoking and emotion filled lyrics of any recent band, let alone a metal band that fucking rocks.  
Everything off ...And Justice For All is packed with great lyrics about the corruption of the US government it's justice system, etc.  In addition, songs like Disposable Heroes, Don't Tread On Me, and For Whom The Bell Tolls have distinctly anti-war messages (the true sign of an intelligent man because for a long time I was an ignorant patriotic kid until thing like Metallica, Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down, Carlos Castaneda, Chuck Pahlaniuk, and Joseph Heller allowed me to open my mind).  Metallica's songs point out the problems in our world that most people are too ignorant to see, and songs like Fade To Black and One convey emotion like no other band can.
I'm not trying to come down on you hard, but just think and have proof to back up statements such as Metallica not having good lyrics.

To me, this song is about being depressed/suicidal, but knowing that it's bad for other people. I'm in a very similar situation, and the more you tell other people the worse they are because of it. So the best thing to do is just fake everybody out. ""Silence gives you space"" - so many people have told me that they ""need space"" but then they say you're ""not alone"" but it's just not true. He feels he has to fake everybody out for their own good and let them think the silence means everything is good.

I, I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far.

@musicgenie 















Adding on to the general idea that this song is centered around depression and ""faking people out"" so they believe he's fine, I believe
""I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space""
refers to him, once he's out of the public eye, ceasing to be talkative and dreading having to overthink everything he's done wrong, and how uneeded he is.

@AnEnigma 















I feel like this song is about depression. But feeling like no one understands him. Also not wanting to show someone he loves that side of him. Like the chorus when it says And I'll fall down, and I'll break down and I'll fake you out. The song is about feeling depression but not wanting to show anyone, so he will just act like hes happy and trick people into thinking he is.

@meganchristine 















I agree with all the other interpretations, except I'd add that it seems Tyler is referencing a struggle with self-harm, specifically cutting, when he says ""And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines/That remind me of all the times
I have committed/Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted/To what I've done and what I'm doing."" 
I interpret this as him saying he looks at his wrists and in his head he envisions them sliced up (""bleeding lines""), leading me to think he used to suffer from self-harm but is trying to break his addiction, yet still he wants to cut himself when he looks at his arms. He says his cutting, or ""dirty, dirty crimes"" are ""form-fitted to what [he's] done and what [he's] doing"", meaning he cuts, or used to cut himself, as a form of self-punishment, almost. He then continues with the song to say ""that's what all the kids are doing"" and if ""you're one of them, you're one of me"", saying he understands and that we're unified in that way.

@LindseyW 















This song hits me for the idea of hiding depression from other people, and feeling like you should just run away without anyone knowing, but since that's been covered I'll give something else I think it applies to. 
When he says ""I'll never be what you see inside"" it's God he's talking about, and the feeling of trying to live up to being what he thinks you could be is tough because, as a saved sinner, you fall back into patterns of sin. He might have that frustrating pattern in mind when he says, in personification of his own actions , ""I'll fake you out,"" as he is mad at himself and knows he could do better, but it seems like this is the best he can do. He says ""I'm so afraid of what you have to say"" because he knows what God is thinking. ""Because I am quiet now, and silence gives you space"" ...when you're alone you are forced to introspect and his silence gives God room to be closer to him. A long monologue occurs often in prayer because it's one sided, where God does not reply face to face--and that's exactly what the song is: a message to somone. He questions Jesus's claim that he is close...""is close the closest star?"" Because before he lets God take over in his pain, before he is finally silent, he feels like he's so distant as lonely pain, tearing his sole multiplies...he's scared about being quiet because it gives him space where he can come close to him, bringing punishment, but the truth is He wants to know him and have a relationship and he knows it's just that his brain is sick (but that's ok). In the rap he talks about the day being the same game as it always is, and his crimes are his sins.  
Tyler and Josh are Christians, so I don't think this is too far fetched. I'm one too so I know some verses that show he fits the song's description. God sets loneliness in people to bring them closer to him by drawing them to thought. Psalm 68:6""God sets the lonely in families..."" and for me, that's what got me to finally think about Jesus and realize my need for rescue. I had to force myself further into isolation incurred by the world and when I thought through my pain, I found God. The bible says those who persue him find him, and it's true. It's crazy to see other people like Tyler that have the same story (even if this song doesn't mean this, he talks about it in other songs and interviews). Luke 5:16 says, ""Jesus withdrew into lonely places and he prayed,"" so what I've found is mourning is not just something you do when somebody dies...I need prayer for my sake, that's why God makes it one sided. When Tyler does that twitching thing it's touching cuz I have always had that same strange physical exertion of emotion when I really try to deal with how I feel.  I have to think through all my hurts because sometimes I feel like I spend my whole day faking people out and I finally can get in the shower and drown out the noise and think and pray. That was my life for 2 years of school and I still need prayer like I did then, though I believe in his forgiveness a lot more now. It takes time to really see that you're forgiven. If you think I'm crazy or stupid, trust me Ive actually thought it through. when people try to prove or disprove God's real with philosophy it's just using natural means to explain the supernatural. People only believe cuz he changed them or they see somone has been changed, and Jesus knew that and so he said they will know you by your love. It's really just faith. I guess car radio would've been a better song to rant on but oh well u should probably read the lyrics to both of these songs with my points in mind and see what u get.

@Jønah! So I have a question for you... Because I am not a Christian myself (or any other religion for that matter), there is something I still don't get. I get how you can have the feeling of finding God through your pain. Also, the general idea is that you are a ""saved sinner"" and that you have to try not to fall back into sin. . (Right??) That also relates to the purpose of life to me in a sense ... Is the goal here to be the best person you can be? 

So then there is one thing that doesn't make sense to me. There seems to be, throughout all of the songs on blurryface, a really big fear of failure. Not being able to be the best person you can be. Not living up to Gods standards or your own standards. I can relate to that fear A LOT. And then I wonder. Shouldnt God be the one that will accept and understand and support you no matter what? So why and how can you have that much fear and anxiety and worry about if he will leave. .. or dissaprove or what ever. ? 

Can you maybe explain how this works? I'm getting more and more the references to God in the lyrics... and want to be able to connect that to the anxiety he expresses also.

@francis103 I know for me, personally, I am in a constant battle between feeling like I'm not good enough to deserve the love God gives me freely and feeling that sense of relief in knowing that he will in fact love me. Similar to parents (most hopefully) they will always love you but that doesn't mean at times you don't feel anxious or fear that they will be disappointed or upset with you. 

So basically it's thinking ""ive done some pretty questionable things"" and ""how can He still love me after everything I've done?"" Almost a disbelief that it doesn't matter Hes there and he won't ever leave. Doesn't stop you from questioning if you're the worst person in the world and if He will leave.

@francis103 @WhereFromHere @James Sever @Jønah!
this band does a good job with creating thought provoking songs that people can approach with different backgrounds and come out with different interpretations that still are consistent with the points made in the song, hence why they are my fav band. You can dive into a Christain meaning for most of them, so Im finding that Tyler's inspiration comes from his efforts to work through his past via a relationship with Jesus. To answer your question (francis103) I'll explicate the Judge a little bit: he says ""when the leader of the bad guys sang, something soft and soaked in pain"" means ""hurt people hurt people"" and it turns out that somone so vested in hate reveals his true enemy to be himself. Pain, revealed in isolation, brought him to simply think. Behold, an overarching theme of Vessel and Blurryface: when you run out of distractions in life, when you think, you wake up to the pain you've numbly been living in. While it sits in your subconscious during the day, it is exposed during the night, or anywhere else where you don't have distractions. (Ode to Sleep: ""the window sill [a means of suicide] looks really nice, right? It probably happens at night, right?"") When the day of faking people out is over its night and you have to be alone and deal with how you feel. In the judge this character (who's actually named Blurryface) feels so guilty, as though he were he's public enemy #1, and cries out to God because he sees that his ""sole is freezing"" so he will ""set him free"". I think he feels guilty, and beats himself up (""his for walls declare him insane""), because in this world Blurryface (who represents Tyler's insecurities) gets his self worth from people. For me, what I've realized is that when you try to get it from yourself you realize that you are the source of the question and so you can believe it. Maybe you try to get it from your parents, but you don't believe it cuz your in doubt of their objectiveness. So then i ""asked"" people in school. Not verbally, of course, but through actions I would not normally do to get their approval. Unfortunately, they'd approve by laughing at my jokes and stuff, but I never believed it. My relief from the question of my self worth wore off, so I'd have to ask again and again. Soon I realized no one has any real grounds for determining if anyone has worth or meaning, as they are also humans. The message of the world was clear: you are worthless. They stopped including me, for example... Then I heard some bible verses and they just swam in my mind, speaking louder than everything else for me. This is why Blurryface is feeling guilty in the judge: cuz he's listening to the world. But to derive your identity from what you do, control, and what people say about you is meaningless because these things all change! And to derive your self worth from the world is meaningless, but I found that God's love doesn't change, and so I take my identity as ""the beloved of God"". So why do I, as a new Christain, still feel so guiltily? Because it's so abnormal to me--so radically different from the lies I've been beleiving my whole life--that I am unconditionally loved by God. Tylerc Josh, and those who replied to my comment can't help but doubt it because it's so different from the world we live in.  In Car Radio he says ""there's faith, and there's sleep"". We need to pick one because so many people are living as though they are asleep, and his pain is what taught him that to have faith is to be awake. To be awake is to think, and when you think it will bring you to the realization that life's not right the way it is, we aren't meant for this world, and ultimately that he found redemption through Jesus. It says in the bible that God makes use of pain in our lives to draw people to him.

I believe that this song is about pretending to be okay. Tyler is feeling distant from the people who claim to want to help him, so he fakes them out. He wants them to believe he is okay, when he really isn't. ""And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines that remind me of all the times I have committed dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted,"" Tyler is ashamed of his self-harm, and doesn't want the people who are trying to help him find out. He's faking everyone out.

I think this song is about being alone and feeling suicidal because of it. 

""I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name.""
Basically these lines say he wants to drive straight into oncoming traffic.

To me the hook is talking about being alone and depressed but making everyone think that you're fine, hense the lines ""And I'll fall down, and I'll break down
And I'll fake you out""

@chccarson 















Me personally, i think this song is about depression. At the beginning he says ""in the night, headlights call my name"" he's thinking about walking into traffic. Then he goes on to say ""I'll never be, be what you see inside. You say I'm not alone, but i am petrified. You say that you are close, is close the closest star? You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far. And I'll fall, and I'll break and I'll fake. All i wanna"" i think he is feeling a little worthless. Or feels like hes not living up to the persons standards. He thinks he isn't good enough. He don't want to disappoint the person by tell them about his depression and suicidal thoughts so he hides them inside and its slowly starting to break him, but he isn't gonna show it. Then he goes on talk to about bleeding lines on his wrist, which is cutting. He also talks about kids committing suicide because they feel like they have no control over themselves, their thoughts & their lives. He goes on to say ""our brains are sick but thats okay"" thats him saying its okay not to be okay. Earlier in the song he says ""I'm so afraid of what you have to say, cause i am quite now & silence gives you space"" i think he is talking to his depression. Or his mind i guess you could say. When you're depressed and you're with others is easier to ignore the thoughts. But when you're alone and you're quiet, they become loud and suffocating and theres no way to stop it. ""I'm so afraid of what you have to say"" he's afraid of his mind and what kind of thoughts hes gonna have whrn he's alone.

I feel like this song is about hiding his depression from people or someone close, like when he says ""You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far"" whoever he is talking about thinks that they are close to him, but really they are like the closest start which is probably like millions of miles away, he feels that they dont understand and he fakes them out when he 'falls and breaks' he says hes alright and they believe him,and he fakes them out, cause they really arent as close as they say they are, i feel like i have a strong connection to this song, i feel like no one really knows whats going on inside my head,everyone believes you when you say""im fine/its alright im just tired/im ok"" ect.

and since when Selena is Justin's ""best friend""? she had just started to hang out with him just when the world knows him, then they only built a friendship for few months before finally dated.
""I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart"" proves that its anyone but Selena. how come she got wall wrapped all the way around her heart when the only thing she does is dating any guy who's famous atm?

I know I sound like a mean person, but I'm not. I'm just stating my opinion but...honestly I would be really disappointed if this actually tells about her

Well,THIS IS Really a sad song and my Fav song among Justin Bieber's Believe  Album.
This Has Common sensation of teling that he loves a girl though he can't say he is in love b'coz the girl he is love in is already broken by someone.He thinks he can fix it by loving her and not breaking her again.He thinks it's too late but he will catch if she falls in love.
He is too afraid to tell her if se deies or she won't answer his question.But if she loves her they both acn be together forever and ever when she FALL's in LOVE.

She(he) would welcome me with her(his) arms, open wide, and a smile
Will shadow me brighter(2Cor11:14) than the sun
She(he) hasn't had a fair(so-called) chance, so I'll give her(him) one
Let me tell you who she(he) is, yeah

[Chorus]
She's a fallen angel(Isaiah14:12-15), sent from heaven up above
She's a fallen angel, waiting for me to love her(him), yeah
(Know that she's) She's(he's) a fallen angel, take your judgment(so-called) off her(him)
I know, that she's(he's) a fallen angel

[Verse 2]
You know, I could
Help her mend, her broken wings
So she(he) can fly again(he never will; his time is short)
But I don't, wanna lose everything that I've gained(fame, money, power...)
Turning me a selfish man (oh)
Cause without em my heart just don't go, no more (no more)
I couldn't take the pain, from watching her(him) fly away
So say that you'll stay
She's mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't you
Baby don't you (don't you worry) worry
I'm goin' help you (I'm goin' help you ) fly
(I'm goin' help you fly)
Just take me under yo (take me under) wings,
And we can reach the (we can reach the) sky
(we can reach the sky)
Baby don't you (don't you worry) worry,
I'm goin' help you (I'm goin' help you ) fly
(I'm goin' help you fly)
Yo mama, don't you (take me under) worry
You goin' reach the (we can reach the) sky
(we can reach the sky)
She's(he's) a

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Baby I know
I know that they done hurt(so-called) you
But I'm here
Let's take it all away(that's not gonna happen)
So if you let me,
You know what, just put your heart in my hands
And everything they(God, the angels that didn't rebel, and Christians) say, I take it back(fool)
Like this

[Verse 5: Reverse]
You(God, the angels that didn't rebel, and Christians)don't mean nothing,
I don't want ya, 
I don't need ya, 
Never loved ya, 
You're nobody,
And I'll never make it(not to heaven, you won't, unless you get your soul back, chris), 
You're a mistake(cool story, bro) (oh)

How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. Isaiah 14:12-15 KJV

And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 2 Corinthians 11:14 KJV

@amazingasalways 















Basically he's singing about this girl who he sees hurting from what other people have done to her. But he sees her as something amazing who has such great potential who just needs a little love to reach her greatness, like an angel. He knows he can help her, and she can help him, because together they can be greater than everything. You have to listen to the end of the song carefully because the first time I heard it, I thought he was saying he was going to take back everything he had said to her. But actually he is telling her to tell the people who hurt her to take it back, and tell them that they are nothing if all they do is say hurtful things to people to bring them down.

Very catchy, we know she has a different but awesome voice, even if it is touched we know she can legitimately sing, or at least I believe so. (: Looking forward to the albummmm! Anyone know the Australian release date?

Demi's came out about 2 weeks after the US so hopefully it's the same. Oh, and by the way, are CD's universal? They are aren't they? So I could buy a CD from the US and it'd play anywhere in the world?

This song is well-written, but also disturbing. It's about a person raped as a child who finds his sexuality screwed up as a result, trying to rationalize what was done to him as harmless or even somehow positive, focusing on it to the point that he rejects attractive women to zero in on women who resemble his rapist so he can re-enact the trauma. If only the writer had gotten therapy rather than rationalizing his problem and embracing his sickness as though it were his only healthy aspect.

First time I read the lyrics to this song! Sometimes you never know ""who"" a song was written about, whether it was personal, or from a 3rd perspective. 

""But I knew life before I left my nursery
Left alone with big fat Fanny
She was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman, you made a bad boy out of me""

This boy was was abused by his nanny, Fanny.

""Oh, you gonna take me home tonight (please)""
He likes aggressive type of ladies. Child hood experiences effect your adult impulses.

""Oh, down beside your red firelight"" 
A light he remembers from where he was taken as a child, 
A fancy red lamp, furnace or fireplace?   

""Take me to them dirty ladies every time"" 
ladies, not girls here? Again from childhood experiences. 

""Now your mortgages and homes"" 
Tough one... Who knows what this means? A message to the rich maybe? Or to his folks? maybe his folks hired the nanny to care for him because they were to busy, thus he was neglected by them.  

""I've got stiffness in your bones"" ??   Dark stuff.  He is saying Screw you? or he is related in some way? 
Or maybe, New English rock n Roll money meets Old English Monarchy money.  
This is definitely rage... coming out in Rock and Roll.  

""Ain't no beauty queens in this locality"" 
The hired help above? 
Or he came from the poor side of town? 

""Get on your bikes and ride"" 
His nanny rode a bike!?

@Kopachris 















I got turned onto this song as a 12-or-so-year-old kid, and was always moved by it. As an adult, I discovered that the first verse actually refers to sexual abuse by the ""Fanny the Nanny.""  

The song was actually written by Brian May, not Freddie Mercury, which begs the question about whether he is self-disclosing actual events from his history. I agree with the post below that since he had a warped experience as a child, he is left with compulsive sexual weirdness as an adult.  

The rocked-out mood of the song seems to be one of striving for empowerment, yet he acknowledges that he still is involved in the the residuals of his history. 

I always thought the final lyric was ""heap big woman you DONE made a big mad outta me.""  But the lyrics posted above says ""you GONNA make a big man outta me.""  

Quite a big difference from an interpretation standpoint.

Perhaps he has had a life changing experiance, perhaps he is in love, perhaps being in love is a life changing experiance for him. Regardless, this song just makes you feel good; it's easy to get into the groove of the beat, and the way he sings it is just catchy. Exactly what every good song should do.

Don't be unimaginative. Just because it's about coke use doesn't mean it can't be about something else also. I have never done cocaine, and yet I can relate to it. Sometimes I feel like being ""under fifteen feet of pure white snow"" - in deep, deep depression, like a sense of total hopelesness, like a catastrophe had just occurred in my psyche. Eclusion from God, one could say.

@Kvaak kvaak 















The idea about cocaine didn't even pop into my mind before I read this. I guess if you want something to be about cocaine it's about cocaine. For me it symbolised the cold war and life in the Soviet Union and it's satellite Communist states. 

If I may:

""
Where is Michael?
Where is Mark?
Where is Matthew?
Now it's getting dark...
Where is John? They're all out back
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow
""

throughout the USSR an extensive 'cleansing, assimilation and persecution' programme was taking place. People and families would disappear over night and (the ones who wouldn't be killed on the spot) would get exiled to gulags in the north-eastern part in russia (Syberia). These regions are known for it's atrocious cold weather (down to -50 Celcius) and extensive snowfall. 

""I waved to my neighbour
My neighbour waved to me
But my neighbour
Is my enemy"" 

In my belief in a way this could be about cold war, but mainly about the atrocities, distrust and alienation of people to one another throughout communist times. 

""I can't even find
Anything worth stealing
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow""

Completely unfair distribution of resources due to which most people would have to queue for long hours and still couldn't get such products as meat and bread in any market.

His constant questions throughought the song like:

""Is there anybody
Out there please?""
""Is there anyone here who doesn't know?
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow""

Reflect upon the iron curtain and that little information would leave the Union, and an expensive propaganda campaign was always in place. But most people knew that everything was falling apart and that they were forsaken (under 15 feet of pure white snow)
The video, the abandoned rooms, the soviet paraphernalia seem to support this argument as does the way that they are all dancing similarly to a certain tune and then everything ""falls apart"".

I guess I see what I want to see, but I just think that Nick Cave would not simply limit himself to the simple topic of ""cocaine"" even though that might be one of the themes of the piece.

@PauPau I think you got it. Very accurate analysis			

I think this song is pretty obviously about cocaine. I also think it's not really just about use cocaine considering, as mackka pointed out, Nick Cave doesn't really write songs that are just about how much drugs suck. I think that the biblical referencing with the names relates to a loss of faith due to the drug use, and the isolation mackka pointed out is literal isolation due to friends dying, paranoia from the drug, and spiritual isolation from losing God. The loss of faith motif is continued when the cry for help, ""oh my Lord"", changes to ""save yourself! help yourself!"", meaning that God cannot help you until you help yourself, ie kick the drugs.

Which is really over-analyzing things I think, because really this is just what happens when Nick Cave, a complex writer fascinated by religion, writes a song about how much drug use sucks.

@JohnApricot - Nick used to wake up everyday in London, go to church to purge himself of the guilt of being a drug addict. Ten he would walk down to meet his 'man' to score enough heroin (he snorted it) and amphetamine to last him the day. He would go back to his shack of a place back in those days and just do his drugs all day. Wake up, rinse and repeat the day before drug addled behavior. When he met his now wife Susie, she had one condition if she were to marry him. She said ""I'll marry you as long as you never go back to church."" In the song off of the same album 'Oh My Lord'. Nick's first line is as follows:                                                       

""I thought I'd take a walk today
It's a mistake I sometimes make
My children lay asleep in bed
My wife lay wide-awake
I kissed her softly on the brow
I tried not to make a sound
But with stony eyes she looked at me
And gently squeezed my hand
Call it a premonition, call it a crazy vision
Call it intuition, something learned from mother
But when she looked up at me, I could clearly see
The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her...,"". 

Going out for a walk for a junkie means going out to use. Nick is also quoted saying something to the effect of ""I'm not the type of rock artist who will tell you how bad drugs are. They were actually pretty good."" The songs he writes speaks about the pitfalls of illicit drugs, but he is not the preacher type against drugs.

This is incredibly well thought out song.

Chernenko aspect of the song, along with critique of communist regime is evident, but I was puzzled by the evangelical singing during the song, so I dug deeper... as in googled it.

Apparently, there's an anti-theistic meaning to it as well. Phrase pure white snow is reference to the verse “Come now, and let us reason together: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.” Basically, the song is about how bound and imprisoned one feels when under the weight of imposed ethical standards.

By having this ambiguous meaning, song clearly makes an analogy between religion and communism (or rather, communistic regime), which I think is brilliant, even if we disregard how great the music itself is.

And while I'll admit that ""snow"" is slang for cocaine (as are about a hundred different words), this is where any possible relation to the topic ends, if for nothing else then for a fact that cocaine is one drug that doesn't make you depressed or alienated. Or at least that's just me and six other people I know.

Anything worth stealing"" referring to ""Thou shall not steal"" are anti-theistic comments that support the idea of being buried under all the ""whiteness.""

I find this interpretation a bit of a stretch, for instance, but then - since it is in line with currently fashionable thinking  - many would find it quite plausible.  And then again, most ardent 'anti-theists' I came across have serious trouble admitting that some of the worst atrocities that committed in the 20th century happened under militantly atheistic regimes and that paradigm 'power corrupts' applies to people irrespective of their religious or ideological adherences. 

As for the song - it is open to multiple layers of meaning, but the most evident is alienation, loneliness, weight of your own problems - something closer to the frozen heart of Hell in Dante's Inferno, than any political statement.

Although drug addiction and people who died alone in the Gulags of the frozen north, often after being denounced to the KGB by their next door neighbours, are the themes that also spring to mind.			






			Also, I think it's obvious that verses such as ""They're all out back
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow"" referring to evangelists, and ""but my neighbor is my enemy,"" referring to ""love thy neighbor,"" and ""I can't even find
Anything worth stealing"" referring to ""Thou shall not steal"" are anti-theistic comments that support the idea of being buried under all the ""whiteness.""

			it's about sex! dancing is a metaphor for sex in the song. 

""When I close my eyes I see me and you at the prom,
We've been both been waiting so long for this day
To come now that it's here lets make it special
There's so many thoughts in my mind the DJ's playing
My favorite song ain't no chaperone's this could be
The night of a dream.""

he says they've been waiting for so long and they want it to be special. they're finally alone without a chaperone. 

""If you give, give the first dance to me girl I promise
I'll be gentle but we gotta do it slowly if you give,
Give your first dance to me we'll cherish every moment,
It only happens once, once in a life time.""

he says he'll be gentle with her and they'll do it slowly, and that your first time only happens once.

""Everybody says that we look cute together lets make this a night
The two us remember, no teachers around to see us dancin' close
I'm tellin' you our parents will never know before the lights
Up and the music turns off now's the perfect time for me to taste
Your lipgloss, your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll
Make it before the clock strikes nine.""

There's no parents around to know they did ""it.""

			It's about his first kiss! And by saying ""he'll be gentle"" he's saying he's not going to shove his tongue down her throat, or be aggressive. Really, what's up with people's minds these days? Get it right.

well, I really love this song. at first, I thought it's about first dance on the prom etc, but when I listened it carefully I relized that it's (probably) about loosing virginity. 
''Girl, I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly''
''It happens once, once in lifetime''
Now I think it really is about the first sex. lol btw sorry about my english, It's not my mother tounge..

Sounds like a double meaning for a song. The lyrics clearly state they are going to prom, and most people assume prom is where people lose their virginity -- American Pie movies, etc -- because they are going to college soon, and want to ""experience things."" Could be special moments, too, but I believe it's about losing your virginity with a person you held close.

Noticing the royal ""We"" is essential to this song making any sense whatsoever.

And 17th century would be more accurate, you mean Louis XIV (well, he's kinda both). But it's more 17th century anyway since the harpsichord is such a baroque instrument and absolutism a baroque concept, and baroque is by and large more 17th century. Those aspects of it that express the same attitudes as this song were working their way towards being reacted against during the first half of the eighteenth century, and after that there was the enlightenment and classicism. But then the harpsichord was popular throughout the eighteenth century as well, just, not versailles-style absolutism like this song is evocative of.

376,For Whom The Bell Tolls.json,"
To me this song is just about war in general.  Soldiers go off to war, defending their country, and are willing to give their life for a cause that they may not completely agree with or understand.  The part, ""For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know"" could mean men are defending a hill (strategic point on a battle field) and they are willing to kill the enemy but the overall cause of why they are fighting they do not know.  The part in the song referring to the men going insane is just a typical side effect of men going off to war.  All the blood, death, and screaming sounds on the battle field are enough to rattle any man's sanity.  Last of all, ""Take a look to the sky just before you die"" is the typical thing many people are said to do before they die.  As they are looking up at the sky their life flashes before their eyes and they get one last glimpse of this world and try to take it all in.

			Specifically, the song is about El Sordo's guerrilla band's final fight. That's pretty much exactly it. Metallica isn't commenting on anything really; just re-saying what's stated, either overtly or covertly in the book.

This song I've always understood to mean about the insanity of war.  Obviously the title came from Hemingway.  After reading the book, it would seem clear that the band members have read it too.  In the book, you read of the moment that everything goes quiet, just before all hell breaks loose (hears the silence so loud)  There is talk of defending a hill, and there is mention of the stiffening wounds suffered in battle.  Near the end, the book's protagonist (the American whose name I forget) looks up to the sky while he is alone, dying.

Yes, war is insane.  But sometimes, folks, war is justified.  God bless America in her fight against terrorism.

@JR I'd say wars can be justified, in the sense that sometimes they are brought to your door step (and therefore it is better to die on your feet than live on your knees). But in regards to terrorism, this is a ""war"" that can't be won (not in the traditional sense). Unfortunately governments haven't worked this out yet ... and until they do they will continue to lose that ""war"".

First of all, I think this is one of the best Metallica songs ever. It's absolutly brilliant and a good example for the band's and his lyrics' genius. When I first heard the song I just thought ""WOW"".
I like the Ride The Ligtnig-version more than the S&M one (that church bell in the background is absolutly cool!).

@JR, 4saken4 and Bulkyone:
could you please stop talking that patriotism shit?! That whole ""defending our country"", ""holy cause"" and ""god bless america"" is CRAP!
There is no glorious war, no matter what people are fighting for. War was always the same and will always be the same: Senseless destruction and killing. I'me sure no one of you knows what war is like in reality. My mother often told me about my grandfather; about him sitting the whole night in his chair and crying because he couldn't forget what he saw on the front. 
So I hope you pray to god (or whoever you pray to) that you'll never know what war is like in reality. With the words of Benjamin Franklin:
""There is no good war and no bad peace""

fight against terrorism is an illusion. usa will never win this war, and by the way, there isn't a 'good war'.. i agree with Insanitas.. patriotism in THIS way is crap! how can people be proud of killing others?

This shows that Metallica is a very intelligent band who realizes how idiotic war is especially because both sides think they're right, but neither knows what they are really fighting for and why it is worth killing another.
This band is so deep, I love it.  I hope everybody is affected by this song as much as I am.

"
377,Forbidden Fruit.json,nil
378,Forest.json,"
I always felt like this song was about worries, fears, and problems that you can never really leave behind and trying to escape from them momentarily even though you know in the back of you mind they are still there. In the first verse it gets into these problems, ""wanting to be listened to"" not ""heard"" and being bothered when others have the same name. Then after another verse it ends with ""So let's think of something better"" and the chorus starts. I think the ""forest"" represents a place to escape to and ""singing"" as something to tune out your problems with. When they mention the chorus being one that everybody knows I imagine it's because it's supposed to be ""normal"" and ""expected"" which is what he is trying to be by avoiding his problems and putting up a front. The ""hands held higher"" and ""we'll"" be on fire"" part is the problems catching up to him. Then in the next verse he addresses them:
""Quickly moving towards the storm
Moving forward, torn into pieces
Over reasons of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes

Have you ever done that, when you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And when just enough light comes from just the right side
And you find that you're not who you're supposed to be?
This is not what you're supposed to see""

In these verses he has stepped out of the forest and is slowly coming back to the reality of his situation. That nothing is perfect and the harder he focuses on it, the worse the problems seem. After spending so much time away in his ""forest"" he has forgotten his own problems and when they suddenly show up again he panics and they seem 10x worse. Hence:

""Please, remember me, I am supposed to be king of the king
Devil swinging on the swing, something happened in my imagination
The situation's becoming dire, my treehouse is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned""

In fear he runs back to his ""forest"" and continues to ignore his problems.

			i feel like the eye lash thing is supposed to be much more literally taken for some reason.  I've found myself doing it, so i related it.   Sometimes things youre so used to just seem a little different, you see from a different perspective and you feel insignificant.

I get that his treehouse is his escape or even his dreams or hopes, referencing his childlike aspirations. But as he grew up, through all the changes that took place in his life, he inadvertently set fire to those dreams....aka he changed to  degree where he can't go back.

@LindRawr I agree, but I also think that when he talks about his tree house, he's talking about his dreams and goals. But then when he says that it's on fire and he has gas on his hands, I think he's saying that he thinks that the goals and dreams are childish and he is never going to accomplish them, so he destroyed them, like in We Don't Believe What's On TV from Blurryface when he says ""We have all learned to kill our dreams.""			







+1








 
@LindRawr I was going to quote the two parts that you quoted from his rap verse. I have anxiety, and I relate to some of these lyrics so much, it just feels like he's describing exactly how it makes me feel. 

""I don't understand why everything I adore takes a different form when I close my eyes"", followed by the part about the eyelashes and such. That's just what it's like for me. And then in the end of it all, the anxiety attack or the panic attack, when I start to get ahold of myself again... ""my tree house is on fire and for some reason I smell gas on my hands, this is not what I had planned"". You start to feel like it's your fault, because you can't get control over your worries, fears, anxieties. It takes over and you go down this path in your head, or maybe the wrong path in the forest in the terms of this song, and you just... start listening to the worries and believing it's true and seeing things distorted. And at the end you didn't mean for any of that to happen, even if it all happened in your head.

@LindRawr this meaning makes so much sense :3			

The chorus:

Down in the forest we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote

--- I am one to believe that all people yearn for something more.  However, we all get trapped in our own little lives, our problems, and the ways we cope.  Breaking out of tradition is scary.  

One of my favorite lines from any song comes from NOFX's the decline:  

""Only moron and genius
Would fight a losing battle
Against the super ego
When giving in is so damn comforting

And so we go, on with our lives
We know the truth, but prefer lies
Lies are simple, simple is bliss
Why go against tradition when we can
Admit defeat, live in decline
Be the victim of our own design
The status quo, built on suspect
Why would anyone stick out their neck?""

Heading to the forest, a place outside of society, we all sing the same song, the underlying will to want something more out of life, but we sing a song no one knew, which means we walk our own path.

This is a sentiment I truly believe.  People have become so content with being a cog that the term 'individual' is slowly disappearing. Hence, ""Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?""

I really relate with squinting of your eyes.  It might not happen often, and when it does, it doesn't last long, but you see something in from a different perspective.  

Great song.

@fr0st2k 















i agree with most of these comments however i feel like i should add one thing. the rap should be reviewed once again. 

""quickly moving towards the storm moving forward torn into pieces over reasons of what these storms are for""
im not 100% sure but it seems like he is saying that he left his forest, his happy place, and now its harder to get back there. so now he is walking into the storm & he is coming apart. he isnt mainly coming apart because of the storm itself, he is coming apart after trying to fix the storm. 

""i dont understand why everything i adore takes a different form when i squint my eyes""
i guess you could say his forest is like his car radio was. it distracted him from the bad aspects of life & when it was gone, he had time to think. now that he is outside of the forest, he is thinking. his forest also blinded him (like the effect of rose colored glasses: where you can only see what you want to see aka the good). when he was in the forest he could only see the good aspects & now that he is outside of the forest, he isnt blinded anymore. 

""have you ever done that where you squint your eyes & your eyelashes make it look a little not right & then just enough light comes from just the right side & you find youre not who youre supposed to be?""
still outside of his forest, he is now seeing everything so clearly now & he finds out that the person that he has been all of his life is not who he is supposed to be

""this is not what youre supposed to see please remember me i am supposed to he king of a kingdom swinging on a swing""
he isnt supposed to be the person he thought he was. he is worth more

""something happened to my imagination this situations becoming dire""
his imagination was what was blinding him. he is saying now it is gone & the situation is real and clear.

""my treehouse is on fire & for some reason i smell gas on my hands this is not what i had planned this is not what i had planned""
he realised that he had caused this storm involuntarily & he wants to go back to his forest where everything was good

I absolutely lobe this song. 
I think it is about the things that run through our minds and how our thoughts can really be all over the place. Sometimes our thoughts are so random and get distracted.

""I don't know why I feed on emotion
There's a stomach inside my brain
I don't want to be heard, I want to be listened to
Does it bother anyone else that someone else has your name?""

He's talking about something pretty deep and then are random casual thought. We all think like this all of the time.

@Bajinganlangit 















""I don't know why I feed on emotion
There's a stomach inside my brain""

He enjoys other people's feelings so much, that he actually hungers for them. Could be, that he even actively provokes intense feelings in others. Maybe his own emotions are too terrifying so he uses the others' as a distraction. Or maybe he feels numb and uses the others' emotions to feel anything at all.

""I don't wanna be heard
I want to be listened to""

People generally hear what they want to hear. He longs for someone to take the effort of listening to his meaning behind his words rather than just consuming them. By just consuming words the other person ignores the speaker/writer, which can cause a feeling of dispensability and/or invisibility in him.

""Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?""

We are unique, so why should we share our name with someone else who is a completely different person? It is rather sad that we are used to being just another jane or joe and not even realize let alone worry about it. Phrasing this as a question challenges the reader/listener to question this fact.

""I scream, you scream, we all scream
'Cause we're terrified of what's around the corner
We stay in place
'Cause we don't want to lose our lives
So let's think of something better""

Fear of the unknown is very common, which makes us walk the same roads and do the same things as always and as everyone else around us. Even when we get bored or fed up or revolted by our routines we shrink from trying new things, because it frightens us. He challenges us to overcome our fear and find better ways of dealing with it rather than just ignoring it and thereby staying slave to habits induced by culture or upbringing.

""Down in the forest
We'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher,
We'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote""

I can't help but think that this is about sex which in this context stands for letting out our real self when we are with the right person. True, it could simply mean loud screaming our frustration out in the safe recluse of the forest, but I personally wouldn't call that ""singing"". Also in this part he talks about ""we"" not ""I"". ""Hands held higher"" implies that we can't help but simply surrender to showing our true self to the one person that matters once we feel unobserved by others.

""My brain has given up
White flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought
It might be poisoned
The stomach in my brain
Throws up onto the page""

He has fought a battle against surrendering to open up, lost it and as a result he has changed. The brain that used to feed on the emotions of others to hide behind is now coming out of its closet and instead shows its real self in writing about itself.

""Quickly moving towards a storm
Moving forward, torn
Into pieces over reasons of what these storms are for""

By leaving the safe place of the known (hiding) he moves forward to the unknown (opening up) which feels threatening. He continues forward even if that means great discomfort and uncertainty.

""I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that?
When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light
Comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?""

By squinting we narrow our field of vision so we can focus on certain things. Focussing and dividing that part into small pieces (eyelashes that cut like lines through the vision) makes us see things more clearly. When we are in the right frame of mind this can lead to insights about ourselves. The role(s) we play in our everyday life start to feel wrong. We realize that we live a life imposed on us and that that the things our ego appreciates are insignificant when facing the bottom line of existence aka our true self.

""This is not what you're supposed to see
Please, remember me I am supposed to be
King of a kingdom or swinging on a swing""

These are the thoughts of resistance that come up when walking new paths. We realize that others can see the change in us and that frightens us. Our changing is meant to stay a secret at least until we know our new self and feel safe with it, so we implore the world to stay focussed on the image we used to portrait. In this case either a person in control of himself and others or a harmless, happy child.

""Something happened to my imagination
This situation's becoming dire
My tree house is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned""

Imagination is the first step on the road to self awareness. What if. But sooner or later instead of just being someone else in our minds we sooner or later start acting differently. This feels extremely scary and causes a feeling of chaos and destruction. The tree house resembles a recluse inside a recluse, a safe place in the middle of nowhere. Destroying the tree house means not withholding anything any longer from the one special person who is allowed to see our true self to the very bone of our existence. Being able and willing to do so even surprises ourselves. Opening up was not intended, it just happened out of its own accord.

That's what I get from these lyrics. Thanks for reading :-)

""There's a stomach inside my brain""

I think Tyler is so insightful and smart and clever and just... amazing, but he doesn't even know it. This lyric caught my attention because there is actually something called the ""enteric nervous system"" and it is in your stomach. Some scientists refer to it as ""The Other Brain"". Literally. Something like 50% of your body's serotonin and 90% of your body's dopamine LIVES in your stomach, in that ""other brain"". These are chemicals often associated with depression and anxiety disorders. I just found that so interesting. I know he was saying there's a stomach inside his brain, not vice versa, but it's still interesting to me, even if he didn't mean for anyone to make that connection at all.

“ I don't know why I feed on emotion
There's a stomach inside my brain
I don't wanna be heard
I want to be listened to
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name?
Does it bother anyone else
That someone else has your name, your name”

Taking a religious view on this song I think he’s saying he doesn’t understand why he is so hungry for more knowledge and he doesn’t just want to be heard by people he wants people to listen to the words he’s trying to tell you. When you’re in heaven God gives us all new names and no one else knows that name but you and no one else has that name and he knows that. Here he’s saying he wants his new name not a name other people have. 

“I scream, you scream, we all scream
'Cause we're terrified of what's around the corner
We stay in place
'Cause we don't want to lose our lives
So let's think of something better”

We’re yelling to or at the Lord because of our problems we don’t grow with God cause we’re scared people might think we’re “religious freaks” so he’s trying to find a way to tell you these things subliminally. 

“Down in the forest
We'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher,
We'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote”

The Churches of God will flee to the forest to find the olive tree which represents God. (In the song Trees by Twenty One Pilots he is also speaking about God and how he’s an olive tree) during the end times praising and singing to the Lord and they’ll be filled up or lit up with the Holy Spirit who will teach them the songs they sing to praise God. 

“My brain has given up
White flags are hoisted
I took some food for thought
It might be poisoned
The stomach in my brain
Throws up onto the page”

He’s taken in information thats corrupted by satan and it disgusts him

“Quickly moving towards a storm
Moving forward, torn
Into pieces over reasons of what these storms are for
I don't understand why everything I adore
Takes a different form when I squint my eyes
Have you ever done that?
When you squint your eyes
And your eyelashes make it look a little not right
And then when just enough light
Comes from just the right side
And you find you're not who you're supposed to be?”

When bad things are happening to him he often over thinks things. He doesn’t get why everything he has been told about this life can make no sense at all when you bring God into the picture and you realize that you aren’t supposed to be living on such a corrupted Earth and you’re not living the life God has planned for you, you are you on the inside. Your soul inside a random body. 

“This is not what you're supposed to see
Please, remember me I am supposed to be
King of a kingdom or swinging on a swing
Something happened to my imagination
This situation's becoming dire
My tree house is on fire
And for some reason I smell gas on my hands
This is not what I had planned
This is not what I had planned”

He’s telling you he knows he’s supposed to be living an amazing life in Gods kingdom and so are you. But someone brainwashed us (satan&gov) and corrupted our minds and it’s only getting worse. Dire means extremely serious or urgent. His world around him is on fire now from our sins and he has gas on his hands because he has also sinned even though he didn’t want to and regrets it.

@Miriam98 















I don't know the whole meaning of the WHOLE song. 

But I DO KNOW the meaning of the ""forest.""

It symbolizes a group of people raising their hands. 

""Chorus"" is a common word for a worship song that repeats a lot (Tyler was a worship leader when he wrote this song and all the songs on his first few albums). 

When he says ""down in the forest,"" he's talking about standing among people signing worship songs, with their ""hands held higher.""

This is a symbol Tyler uses in his songs a lot. He uses the symbol of ""trees"" to mean people with their hands raised:

- In ""Going Down"" (""Have you ever heard the trees singing their song"").

- In Ode to Sleep (""the trees wave their arms"")

- In Trees (""silent in the trees, standing cowardly,"" which is someone who is NOT raising their arms nor singing, but is cowardly seeking a connection to God as everyone around them sings and reaches their arms up). 

And I think the ""something better"" he's talking about is God.

I think its about a general state of mind and how we all feel sometimes. It really captures the desperation and loneliness at those particular moments when we are lost. Its probable Tyler Joseph related it to some personal experience and every quote is a methaphor; I say this cause its written almost as a tale or in a narrative way. I personally think its beautifully written and I find it very surprising it hasn´t become a huge hit.

"
381,Forgetting Is the Hardest Part.json,nil
382,Forty Six & 2.json,"
This is one of Tool's most amazing songs, and really sums up the entire theme of Aenima. This song is about growing, changing, and moving towards the next level of human evolution and conciousness. It's deeply rooted in Jungian theory. 

Basically, it's believed that there are three levels of human evolution and each has it's form of conciousness. There's the 1st level with 44 chromosones. These are primitve people's like the aboriginies in Australia who do not percieve anything outside of themselves. They only see one large conciousness with no distinguishment between organisms. Then there's the second level with 46 chromosones. That is us. We are a chaotic disharmonic conciousness that is basically used as a stepping stone between the first and third levels. The third level is 48 chromosones. (Or 46 & 2, with 2 being the sex chromosones x & y). This is the higher level of conciousness. Our destination. 

But this is where the Jungian theory comes in. It is believed that you can not reach this third level of evolution without first delving into yourself and basically cleansing your conciousness for the next jump. That's where the Shadow comes in. The shadow is basically everything about that is unseen that you are uncomfortable with or hate. This is also known as the Anima (hence the name of the CD). 

The last part of the song sums all of this up...

""See my shadow changing, 
Stretching up and over me 
Soften this old armor 
Hoping I can clear the way 
By stepping through my shadow, 
Coming out the other side 
Step into the shadow 
Forty six and two are just ahead of me""

			I know this comment was posted 7 years ago, but I read it and was disgusted and needed to reply.
To correct Oberones and his statement about ""the Aborignies in Australia"", they are not, by any stretch of the imagination, ""primitive people"". They do not have only 44 chromosomes compared to ""the second level"" which have 46. They are exactly like every other human being on the plant - intellegent, with every cognitive, physical and social ability that Oberones himself has. They DO NOT struggle with the idea of perceiving anything outside of themselves, they CAN distinguish between organisms. I am mortified to hear someone state the opposite! 
To suggest that Indigenous Australians are somehow inferior human beings is a narrow minded and vastly incorrect statement, and it's comments like these that are fueling the ""us and them"" mentality between races and cultures. Oberones is obviously not Australian, and has probably not even been to Australia. I challenge you, Oberones, to meet with an Indigneous Australian and determine whether or not they are so different to yourself.

			Did anyone every stop to think that Maynards twisted mind is so twisted that he would write a simple song so that everyone would misinterpret it?
Has anyone ever thought that its about football?
 Well its not..it would be funny if it were so simple....
But again someone says that this 0berones is correct...
In an interview where Danny Carey spoke with a reporter from Slamm magazine it states:

SLAMM:  You mentioned the importance of evolution as it relates to the 
band. ""Forty-six & 2"" off the new album seems to address this theme, 
correct? And what does ""Forty-six & 2"" mean?

Danny:  ""Forty-six & 2"" is a DNA chromosome count. And in the song we 
use it as a metaphor for evolution and change. Right now, humans have 
forty-four plus two, and supposedly the next step in our evolution 
will be the addition of a couple more chromosomes. -end-

   I find this amusing that there are so many comments about tool lyrics...
because Danny also stated that:

Danny:  In our method of composing, Maynard is singing in the room 
with us, but he's not really singing words. The words are an 
afterthought. And the words and lyrics are about 90% Maynard's 
interpretation. We don't place that much significance on them. We want 
people to interpret the music and get their own inspiration out of it. 
That's what we hope for, anyway. That's why we don't put the words in 
the record, either, because people will latch onto them heavily. If 
words were so important, compared to the light and energy that is 
going on the stage, then people would be selling out spoken word 
shows. Which they aren't. The music is what the emphasis is on in our 
band.

			In response to Folkie I can understand why this theory is offensive and racist. I agree with you on that entirely. But it's grossly unfair to blast Oberones for simply explaining what the theory is. He/she never says that this is their personal belief so there is no need for the personal attack. I found the analysis very interesting by the way, even though I don't agree with Jungian theory.

			First off. Aboriginals is a modern term. think of it not so much as just Australians, but lesser evolved people of the past (those with 44). Dont get hung up on human made labels. Think outside the label. 

And on that note of thinking outside the box.
Let me share an observation and question inspired by TaintedDeity's rebuttle.

Jungian theory stresses that people focus too heavily on science and not enough on spirituallity (label it what you may but dont think religiously here).

This is just one out of millions of examples of people relying on scientific theory that is supposedly holding us back according to Jung.

How do we know he is not right?

I am a Anthropology/Philosophy double major right now if it helps for me to qualify myself.

As Danny Carey said in the interview, they have their meaning, and then they build the song to allow for our own interpretations. Stop over-thinking and over-analyzing, because it separates the body from the mind. Just make it what you want it to be.

			I realize this is fourteen years too late, but for the sake of anyone looking into the meaning behind the lyrics to one of TOOL's most arcane masterpieces, please take note: 

Carl Jung != Drunvalo Melchizedek

The title of 46&2 and all the explanations you'll come across regarding chromosomal compositions and their supposed relation to the evolution of consciousness are originating from Melchizedek's books and teachings, not ""the Jungian theory.""

The only EXPLICIT reference to Jungian concepts in this song is where the narrator makes repeated references to his ""shadow."" 

This is not the first time I've seen this online. Interpretations are fine, but please don't attribute this lunatic-fringe chromosome stuff to someone as amazing as Carl Gustav Jung.

@Oberones
@Oberones 

I think the scientific emphasis is a bit too heavy. Jung dressed Gnosticism in the guise of a science for sake of creating a secular spiritual movement.

The anima and animus, forces defined by their contrary nature, are equivalent to the gnostic concept of syzygy.

The Gnostics believed that wisdom, Sophia, was entrapped within matter by her child, the demiurge. The gnostic worldview is both dualistic and progressive. The dualism exists between the evolving realm of concept, language and matter (Sophia), and the opposing realm of deterministic physical experience (the Demiurge). They envisioned Sophia as seeking to separate herself from matter by the organizing the material world in forms that could support progressively developed concepts. According to the gnostic cosmology, this led to the creation of humanity, as a vessel for complex thought through a series of steps called emanations. These emanations were viewed to have manifested as equal and opposite concepts/forms called syzygies: love and hate, self and other, life and death, man and woman, etc. Keep in mind that these are metaphors for awareness. 

The crucifix illustrates the concept. A human form is affixed between the material world (the cross) and the spiritual realm (the sky) in suffering, and suffering is the pathway to bliss by means of the Jungian shadow concept. 

Shaman (and the Hellenistic religions were very shamanistic) find god through the suffering of a vision quest. So Moses isolated himself on a mountain; Jesus, in the desert. 

Now that I've covered the gnostic concept, what was Jung referring to by the 2 additional chromosomes? I suspect Jung was referencing the emanation that will stem from mankind, sort of like Nietzsche's ubermenche. He was saying that, from mankind, there will come another pure concept to break into opposites, just as good and evil cannot exist without one another, and did not exist before man's achievement of moral concept, man will support another emanation of thought (a release of Sophia) that will progress us beyond our current state. 

Jung envisioned this as occurring through the process of imaginative synthesis, what he deemed synchronicity (see the Police song) He wasn't talking apes and men. 			







+1








 
@Oberones 

Looked into it some more. This 48 chromosome nonsense is not z gnostic metaphor, but pseudoscience, promoted by a new religious movement called the Flower of Life Institute. Nothing to do with Jung.

However, the song refers to progressions of conscious awareness, from the perspective of the Jungian shadow. The manifestations of these progressions are like a shedding snake skin, while the confrontation and consumption of the shadow forms an Ouroboros.

It's a mystical message: one must confront their fears to supersede their cognitive limitations, because fear—the unaddressed shadow of the mind—separates humanity from spiritual transcendence. Creation, of both art and psyche, cannot occur in hiding.			







0








 
@Oberones I also believe that this song is about the theory of the superman of the philosopher Nietzsche.  Nietzsche wrote about in Thus Spoke Zarathustra, The Will to Power and other of his writings about that humans are a bridge, a rope between the ape and the superman.  And it is our responsability to evolve into a higher stage of human development.  According to Nietzsche, the superman is a human being who is 100% free, a destroyer of old values, to be replaced with new values.  This song is also related to the theory of the new man by Che Guevara			







+1








 
@Oberones Wow. Pretty rough judgement of the aboriginals! Actually, the song is referring to an evolution 'backwards,' if you will, a man shedding his skin (hence the scab picking and snake crawling imagery.) The character in the song is coming to terms with what he really wants, and accepting who he really is: an animal, with all of its primal, raw and (innocent?) natural qualities. The message is plain: humankind would be better off living 'in' nature than 'above' it, as we are all animals at heart. Animals that have evolved the unique ability to completely and irrevocably destroy the ecology of the environment needed to sustain their very lives.

			Did anyone every stop to think that Maynards twisted mind is so twisted that he would write a simple song so that everyone would misinterpret it?
Has anyone ever thought that its about football?
 Well its not..it would be funny if it were so simple....
But again someone says that this 0berones is correct...
In an interview where Danny Carey spoke with a reporter from Slamm magazine it states:

SLAMM:  You mentioned the importance of evolution as it relates to the 
band. ""Forty-six & 2"" off the new album seems to address this theme, 
correct? And what does ""Forty-six & 2"" mean?

Danny:  ""Forty-six & 2"" is a DNA chromosome count. And in the song we 
use it as a metaphor for evolution and change. Right now, humans have 
forty-four plus two, and supposedly the next step in our evolution 
will be the addition of a couple more chromosomes. -end-

   I find this amusing that there are so many comments about tool lyrics...
because Danny also stated that:

Danny:  In our method of composing, Maynard is singing in the room 
with us, but he's not really singing words. The words are an 
afterthought. And the words and lyrics are about 90% Maynard's 
interpretation. We don't place that much significance on them. We want 
people to interpret the music and get their own inspiration out of it. 
That's what we hope for, anyway. That's why we don't put the words in 
the record, either, because people will latch onto them heavily. If 
words were so important, compared to the light and energy that is 
going on the stage, then people would be selling out spoken word 
shows. Which they aren't. The music is what the emphasis is on in our 
band.


			this can be found at: toolshed.down.net/articles/… 

			In response to Folkie I can understand why this theory is offensive and racist. I agree with you on that entirely. But it's grossly unfair to blast Oberones for simply explaining what the theory is. He/she never says that this is their personal belief so there is no need for the personal attack. I found the analysis very interesting by the way, even though I don't agree with Jungian theory.			

			First off. Aboriginals is a modern term. think of it not so much as just Australians, but lesser evolved people of the past (those with 44). Dont get hung up on human made labels. Think outside the label. 

And on that note of thinking outside the box.
Let me share an observation and question inspired by TaintedDeity's rebuttle.

Jungian theory stresses that people focus too heavily on science and not enough on spirituallity (label it what you may but dont think religiously here).

This is just one out of millions of examples of people relying on scientific theory that is supposedly holding us back according to Jung.

How do we know he is not right?

I am a Anthropology/Philosophy double major right now if it helps for me to qualify myself.			

			Thank you Wallamanage.  Tell TaintedDeity he can stop being a dick now.			

			is there a scientific study that shows that aboriginies have 44 chromosomes?			

			i think that this song refers to bill hicks and the way he thought everything should change. like society politics and religion. the album was devoted to him. i think that by ""stepping through my shadow"" is what he wanted the world to do. he wanted them to feel the change because bill hicks comedy was about this stuff.
eulogy another song from aenima was also about bill hicks and what he had to say			

			in Jungian Psychology the shadow and the Anima are seperate, the Shadow being merely repressed and uncomfortable parts of your psyche, and the Anima being the feminine part of a male psyche, just as the Animus would be the masculine part of the female psyche. Just thought I'd put that out there.			

			what the fuckkkkk			

			I think everyone in this should listen to ""Lateralus"" from the same-titles album... You guys are overthinking everything. I definitely agree that there is some back story to the lyrics most likely involving this Jungian Theory stuff, but that does not connect to Maynard at all, and we are not going to connect to it through the Jungian Theory either. As Danny Carey said in the interview, they have their meaning, and then they build the song to allow for our own interpretations. Stop over-thinking and over-analyzing, because it separates the body from the mind. Just make it what you want it to be.

""FourFiveSeconds"" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna, American rapper Kanye West and English musician Paul McCartney for Rihanna's upcoming eighth studio album. It was written and produced by West, McCartney, Mike Dean, Dave Longstreth and Noah Goldstein with an additional writing from Kirby Lauryen, Ty Dolla Sign, Dallas Austin and Elon Rutberg. Previewed by West at the iHeartMedia Music Summit on January 21, 2015, it was posted on Rihanna's official website on January 24. The same day the song was released as the first single from her upcoming album being made available for digital download. ""FourFiveSeconds"" is a pop and soul pop song with country and folk music influences and an instrumentation consisting of an acoustic guitar, organ and cello.

""FourFiveSeconds"" received critical acclaim from music critics, who praised Rihanna's and West's new direction, their vocals, and the song's minimalistic production. Upon its release, it peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart; in doing so it gave Rihanna her twenty sixth top-ten on the chart while McCartney made a record by ending the longest break between top-ten songs on the chart. The song also peaked at number one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. Internationally, the song reached number one in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden and Ireland and reached the top five in Canada, France and the United Kingdom.

To promote the song, an accompanying music video was directed by Dutch photographer duo Inez and Vinoodh in New York City. Shot in black-and-white, it was met with positive reviews from critics who commended the video's simplicity and compared it to the works of Herb Ritts and Xavier Dolan. Rihanna, McCartney and West performed ""FourFiveSeconds"" for the first time at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards on February 8, 2015; the performance received highly positive reviews. ""FourFiveSeconds"" has been covered by various recording artists, including Canadian rapper Drake and British singer-songwriter James Bay.

This song is about Rihanna getting drunk at 12:00 AM on a Tuesday and getting ready to flip the fuck out based on what someone said on Monday morning. She is now worried that she is going to jail for her puerile behavior even though she hasn't even done it yet. Ah, deductive reasoning.

This song is about the long lost respect for the individual. That respect eminates from the nether reaches of our psyche  reaching out to us, the dismembered constellations..ie the conflicted community.  Beyond the nuclear weapons that protect us from each other, the burning convictions that keep us in check and the marketing that sells us out, our psyche reflects the ancient traditions of respect and wonders how they can be made valuable again.

I think it is sort of a song of hopelessness. The idea that an old man is still planning to ""be rich someday"" is kind of a sad statement.

@J.J. 















I personally believe the song is about learning from the past and having hindsight, rather than just focusing on the present.

The old man saving what others throw away could be a metaphor. He's learning from the past, or ""saving what others throw away"". Expanding on the metaphor, he'll be rich someday with knowledge.

Without hindsight, history repeats itself.
""Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record""

Rather than believing the chorus is truly about ancient radiation and stars, I think this is another metaphor for the past. I believe it's about how the knowledge from the past is still out there, but as the song says, it ""faintly glimmering.""

			I believe you hit the nail on the head, jfrench.  This song is a ballad dedicated to the educated elderly in our world who must endure the pain of watching humanity repeat the same mistakes of its history and watch as it carries on with indifference.

The part about ""an ancient radiation. that haunts dismembered constellations, a faintly glimmering radio station."" Refers to radio signals that travel out into space just now reaching outer limits of space, where frank sinatra's music is still being heard(because its signals are just now arriving)

@Wrapid 















Heh, I'm repeating myself, but I simply love how many different (and perfectly sensible and valid) interpretations you can get from these songs. 
Here's an interesting and unusual one I came up with:

This song could be about the effect of the media and the ""Hollywood syndrome"" on people.  A more subtle ""Californication,"" perhaps?

A dismembered constellation would be a bunch of stars that are split apart and are off by themselves.  They should be grouped together, but instead they alone.  There are more kinds of stars than literal gaseous fireballs in the cosmos, such as movie stars or music stars.

The radiation, which has been going on for years, is the unintended(?) message that Hollywood has been sending out for years about the magic of the movies and the glamorous lifestyle of celebrities.  It contaminates people's minds; they are left with dreams concocted by an industry that they can never achieve.

The stars from the dismembered constellation are the lonesome people who grew up in a western culture, who spent all their life idolizing movie stars and believing that the Hollywood lifestyle is what they truly want.  The message is still, and always will be, reaching them, and plaguing or haunting them.  They still feel that they can be rich and famous someday.  They think they *really* belong among the Hollywood elite (a ""constellation"" or group of movie stars.)  The gloomy and rainy sounding music and imagery of cobwebs falling on what these people bsaed their dreams on just illustrate what a sorry state they're in. 

""Beyond your... etc."" When you look past what the industry does (entertains, makes a point, spreads ideas, and most of all, sells) you see the people it effects.

The sad line about flies and spiders getting along together (really- brilliant writing.) shows the impossibility of these dreams.  Flies and spiders could never get along, because spiders feed off of flies.  Does Hollywood feed off of these people?


...
Eh, it's just an idea.

			I like your interpretation more than anything else I've seen thus far. Cake is definitely a band that considers itself artistic (if not snooty about it), and which goes out of its way to occasionally throw their fans a deeper puzzle. They are also sometimes willing to be goofy and fun, which just shows that they want to be HUMAN and express all of the emotions we experience, instead of just writing music that ""people want to listen to"".

Anyone can sing about sex. Anyone can sing about how dope they are, or how depressed they are, or what they really want to be. This *could* easily be a song about an old person, or looming insanity, or a thousand other things. But I think this song is philosophical; the societal values of 50 years ago are as far away to most people as the constellations... yet someday, there is hope that these things will come back, and that our nostalgic memories (like Sinatra's charm, charisma, and manners, as opposed to his achy-breaky penis, his overinflated ego, or his disturbed emo-ness) will reappear as IMPORTANT parts of human relations.

I think that he makes references to quasars. (ancient radiation in a constalation that's like a glimering radio station [quasars give off flickering radio waves]) the entire song he is refering to old things that most people forget about - things that most people ""throw away"" symbolically, just like they do with chinese lamps and stamps - the first time I heard this song I thought he was making out the old man to be fool, but I realize now that it is a lament for whorthwhile things that are ignored by our society - hence the sad, lament-like sound to the song.

@Vengance 















bobwronski has a really convincing interpretation but i always thought it had almost the exact opposite meaning.  maybe im a glass half full kinda guy (either that or i am incapable of picking up on irony in lyrics).  
i think the song is a criticism of the 9 to 5 lifestyle.  the old man is the result of a lifetime wasted chasing the american dream working at some mundane task (collecting stamps).
on the other hand, musicians (like frank sinatra) can accomplish greatness far beyond mere wealth.  hell, the beatles were bigger than jesus.  popular music is appreciated by the entire world.  it can make people forget their troubles and even make ""flies and spiders get along"".
the significance of touching others with your art is greater than almost any other trivial endeavor of mankind.  
its bigger than the ""ad campaigns"" of men in suits trying to take over the world (or atleast their target market).
its bigger than the ""flaming truths"" about the meaning of life on earth.
its even bigger than this ""roost"" we call home, or the galaxy surrounding it.  
frank sinatras songs will be riding radio waves for millions of years, exploring ""dismembered constilations"" and 1000 years from now his legacy will live on on the planet omicron persei 8.

			I agree with what you're saying, and it's another very original interpretation of this song.			






			I agree with what you're saying, and it's another very original interpretation of this song.			

It's great to read all of your comments, there are some excellent interpretations here and of course none are wrong. Even if CAKE had a certain intention for a specific message to be taken, if you take another it simply adds to the song's meaning.

My interpretation is rather simple. The old man is collecting old artefacts in the knowledge that 'he'll be rich someday'. The old man has lived long enough to know that history repeats itself, akin to the 'old skipping record' , therefore his collections will one day be of high value. Cross reference with 'Sad Songs and Waltzes' in which CAKE tell of a cheating lover whose crimes won't be listened to because 'sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year' and it's a warning that even if people try to hide the truth, in the end there will be a moment when someone will be listening the truth will out.

I agree with the interpretations already made of the radio signal, but would like to add my own. The source of the signal, like a collapsed star, may have ceased long ago or may play completely new music at the same time that Frank Sinatra has reached stars far away. I apply this to the old man, who may die soon but he will leave a legacy. Summary: art/music/collections of fine things are a way to become immortal (this is of course partially self-referential on CAKE's behalf).

@aaldrich_uk 















Forgive me for my Tin Hat theory, but I've always thought this song was about time travel. So, in a future world, we are not doing well. The world is violent, aoverpolutted, etc and I guess you could so close to apocalypse/armageddon. So, one of the world's goverments manages to send a man back in time useing a terminator time machine ( one-way, no way back.) ""...while Frank Sinatra plays stormy weather..."" The man is sent back to approxmantly 30's-50's, a big time for Sinatra. Useing the objectives his govement gave him, he manages to fix many of the world's future problems by correct them as they first begin in the past, creating an almost butterfly effect. While thier, however, he manages to ""collect some stamps"" because he'll be ""rich one day."" He basically invests in things thought trivial during the 30's-50's and gains welath from them, knowing how they would be used in the future. Now, the ""...flies and spiders getting along together, while cobwebs fall on an old spinning record."" I'm pretty sure theirs a Biblical verse that roughly states "" theirs a season for all things."" Theirs been so many different kingdoms and empires throughout history, but even grand empires fall, and those who are left pick up and create a new empire in its place, starting the cycle over again. Now, a skip in a record is when the needle has reached an error in the disk, and goes backwords to a more durable part in the disc to continue playing ( I'm pretty sure it can also move forward during a skip, not sure though.) This means that with this new technology of time travel, their will never be another ""fallen empire."" and that we can just send another man back in time to correct our mistakes, thus breaking the ""season for all things"" cycle, and creating an almost, if not totally perfect, society.

I’m sure I’m not the only woman who felt they could relate to Anne-Marie upon listening to her new track “Friends.” In a world that misguidedly continues to consider the “friendzone” a thing (spoiler alert, it’s not), women are consistently berated for considering men to be friends when they really believe we should be throwing ourselves at their feet. Yup, I said it. Anne-Marie goes out of her way in this song to let the man crushing on her know that she only wants to be friends with him; she even goes so far as to LITERALLY spell it out for him. But alas, like so many other women in her shoes, she starts to get sick of finding ways to nicely say “no.” “You can’t be reasoned with,” she says, as though she should have to reason with someone about her feelings (seriously?). And then, “I’m done being polite.” Girl, you are not alone. There are several clues, both subtle and blatant, throughout the song that the person trying to win her affections is incapable of taking a hint – I honestly think I’d be done too.

"
398,Gasoline.json,"
Halsey has bipolar disorder. She was hospitalized for a suicide attempt that was caused by it when she was 17. Though the term ""insane"" is completely unacceptable when referring to someone with a mental illness, that is the way we are seen by outsiders (I have the disorder myself). It is very difficult when we are on the depressed end of our condition. Impulsiveness is a signifier of a manic episode the other ""pole"" of the disorder: buying an expensive bottle of booze just to pour it down the drain in the moment she regrets it and using the money that should've gone to her water bill to make herself feel better about the situation. 

Manic episodes are referred to as ""highs"" and depressive states are referred to as ""lows"" by professionals, least by all the ones I've seen. Manic states can be really exhilarating. Most people prefer them because you feel invincible; you're far happier than your are at your your baseline (""normal"" mood state); it feels so good that some people do not seek treatment when they are in the state. The down side is the depressive state that always follows it is debilitating. The line ""are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me?"", she can get ""high"", the euphoric way people hope to feel when they take drugs, without taking them because of her condition. 

Self-deprivating humor is a very common coping mechanism. I do it myself. It makes it easier to explain the way you are feeling without coming on too strong. People respond well to it, even finding it funny if you're particularly good at it. Thus the line, ""Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me?"" 

When you reveal that you're bipolar, people most definitely look at you differently. My parents told me not to tell people for this very reason. They think people will be afraid of me because of the misconceptions that surround the disorder. Halsey is open about her condition, which people like us find really comforting because it tells us we're not alone, but it does add a lot of pressure and detour people from hopping onto her popularity team. Her line, ""Do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?"" is a perfect description of this. 

It is really hard to reveal what you struggle with. People on the outside put in their two cents. They believe people like us should look ""crazy"" and ""act"" it at all times. She's gorgeous. People think she shouldn't ""waste a pretty face"" like hers by letting them know she's not perfect because she's pretty. 

Some people see us as less than people. ""And all the people say
You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being"". And once you let something like that out, you can't go back or make it all go away. 

Being so ostracized or knowing that you will be if reveal a large portion of yourself does take a lot out of your self-esteem. Someone as pretty as her and who is a public figure is assumed to have a never ending supply of self esteem. ""With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline""

""I think there's a flaw in my code
These voices won't leave me alone
Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold"". It is not know exactly what causes the disorder. You can't take an x-ray or have your blood drawn to know that you have it, so you're left to assume their inherently something wrong with you, but you can't put your finger on it. The voices aren't literal. They are the ""voices"" that tell us we're not good enough or will never amount to anything, the same ones that can convince us to kill ourselves. 

Luckily, she knows she is more than her disorder. ""Well my heart is gold and my hands are cold""

She's asking if other people deal with the same things she does. ""Are you deranged like me?
Are you strange like me?
Lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?
Do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me?
Pointing fingers cause you'll never take the blame like me?""

I think this song is about her struggle with bipolar disorder. It's not an uplifting anthem, but she's painfully honest and that's her style. I really appreciate it and her for being so open. She truly helps people like us. Knowing she's using her voice for good is what keeps her going. She's said it in interviews. She says being on stage is the only time when everything melts away and she feels at peace with herself. 

So yeah, meaning!

I think this relates to at least 3 subjects: 1st one being someone who is a star or an artist, someone famous who cannot escape the public eye; they feel under a lot of pressure from society or the moral code and also they are told they are wasting their life by not taking enough advantage of their looks as it is expressed on this line: ""Do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me?
Saying that you shouldn't waste your pretty face like me?""  and also this one ""You can't wake up, this is not a dream - basically refering to the life they live as a star,
""You're part of a machine, you are not a human being"", the machine being part of the media, with their ""face"" all made up, living on a screen"" 2nd one is someone who lives in a city under lots of stress and has some sort of mental disorder a ""flaw in her code"" because of this disease *the voices that speak in her head won't leave her alone*, 3rd focused on the modern type of life (living on the screen with the social media, again related to the being known by everyone, the voices that speak the people judging her. Just my take on it :)

I think it's about someone who has said that I understand what you're going through and she responds with no you don't understand because no one does understand what she is going through she asks things like ""are you deranged like me?""

I think this song is about society and how most people portray others to be perfect. However, most people are far from perfect. Some people are strange, insane, but the important thing about this song is how we all think we are strange however we are all act the same way and are imperfect and they are rebelling the 'perfect person'  which indicates the lines ' the voices in my head won't leave me alone'. The lines I think there's a 'flaw in my code' also talks about how when you're different, people think you are nothing because you aren't perfect and you're different and  'strange' but there is no such thing as a perfect person and we all go through the same shit and we're all fucking hurricanes.

@lovaofnovels9 















I think this also is pointing out the fact that everyone is being the same these days. They all look the same, act the same, post the same things. People will do anything to be known and heard. That's why she sings, You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline""
We all have such low self esteem that we follow others like a machine. Always the same. And when she says,""Lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me?,"" she's trying to say, by being different she's breaking the machine, the trend, and taking the backlash in like a queen. Because she's different, she sets a new normal. Your own normal. There isn't a fault in her code, its a virus that's gonna break trend and make people them themselves again.

john said whenever paul sang that part ""get back to where you once belonged"" he would look at yoko. you know to me, in some ways, this ogn is about john and yoko. or maybe i'm letting my imagination get to me. i feel like it's paul's cry for john to stay with the beatles and also paul saying to yoko stay away from john and leave them and the beatles alone.

jojo is john and loretta is yoko. jojo left his home(the beatles)..for some california grass(this i dunno but i just took a wild guess he went with yoko and then him and yoko were arrested for having pot)

then paul says ""get back"" to both ""jojo"" and ""loretta."" telling ""jojo"" to stay home with the beatles...""where he once belonged."" then telling ""loretta"" to go back wherever she came from.

also in loretta's part. it says ""all the girls around her said she's got it coming. but she gets it while she can"" maybe saying yoko's friends are like ""you're gonna get in trouble if you go with john""...but she goes with john anyway. she gets him while she can?

lol, no one said this is bout john and yoko i just thought of it before.

but anyway, awesome song

@appypollyloggy interesting theory and as the fact it is a cover only some lyrics were relatable, not all of them need to, hell even just the theme of it is enough to go with			

After listening to this sound 50,000 times over the course of my life, it occurred to me recently that this is Paul's attempt at a Lou Reed-type song -- colorful characters with sex and drug hangups going through interesting journeys. Compare the lyrics here to ""Take a Walk on the Wild Side.""

Wasn't really happy with the quality of comments on this one. This song isn't just about a breakup or a young girl he likes, it's really a critique of the behavior of women (esp young, immature girls).

Bite your face to spite your nose
17 and a half years old

He's talking about her general tendancy to act spontaneously or seemingly irrationally. She'll do things that aren't good for her to satiate immediate feelings etc. He then moves into a conversation between her and him as they are hooking up. He's trying to convince her to go further.

Girl:
I'm worrying about my brother finding out
Boy:
What’s the fun in doing what you're told?
Girl""
I said ""No!""

Standard girl behavior! She likes him but draws the line.

'Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned 18 year old
Give me a night I'll make you'

His thoughts after she says no. She actually wants to hook up but he's tired of dealing with the bullshit and having to ""convince"" girls so they feel less guilty about it. He knows he could, but fuck it.

""I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But girl I'm not your savior""

His verbal warning to her. He's not going to play these games and play into the BS. She's looking for a savior, and since she doesn't have religion she's looking to him. This is true for a lot of young people today- they expect too much from relationships. You make you happy, not someone outside of you.

Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

Eventually they get around to it and get it on. God help him- he's getting caught up in the sexy intoxication of it all.

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls

...and he's reminding himself not to get too caught up, because in the end they're just girls.

A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh she's so southern so she feels the cold

I think this is a reference to her looking for a relationship in him when it's just not there. She feels the warmth isn't there but is still holding onto the idea of it.

One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around?

Slowly she eeks her way more and more into his life as a gf, even though that's not what he wanted, and he told her that. She still thinks he'll change his mind.

I said ""Yo, I think I better go, I can't take you
You just sit and get stoned with 30 year olds and you think you've made it""

He leaves because she's making it serious and he doesn't want to. He then moves onto a critique of how she's spending her time. She's young and hot and is getting attention from all the 30 year old men that are successful. This makes her feel good and like she's important.

'Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes?'

He cautions her to not get too caught up in all that. Instead he thinks she should be enjoying her youth and possibly spend it building a relationship with someone her age, rather than being used for her youth by an older man.

Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

Sex again.

They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17

she's immature, she can't fill his needs either.

They're just girls
They're just girls

I told her from the start
Destined to be hard
I told her from the start
I’ll break your heart
Destined to be hard
Break your heart

He told her what he was but she kept ignoring him or thinking she could change his mind.

The rest is pretty much repeat.

@p218  total agree with this but for me I think  rather than being used for her youth by older men I think he's saying yes she should go find someone her age instead of trying to make something out of the non existent relationship  between the two instead of trying to ""change"" him and his mind about the relationship they have. By saying can't be whatcha need if she's 17 kinda gives me the   feeling tht he's telling himself or convincing himself that  shes not what he's looking for because she young and inexperienced and then he basically breaks up with her or rejects her because to him it was nothing serious to him   (told you from the start destined to be hard ) .... Best interpretation I must say exactly what I thought when I heard the song.

so shocked this doesn't have any comments seeing as this is probably the 1975's best song. i think on the surface matthew wrote the song to come across as if he doesn't really care about the girl in question. he needs a distraction and this younger girl is exciting and dangerous because it's breaking the rules. however he's also trying to persuade himself that he doesn't care ""they're just girls"" but he can't help but feel something deeper for her. however she wants to be with him and that scares him because he just wanted to ""mess around"" so he tries to leave her. but she keeps him coming back ""wrestle to the ground, god help me now""

First of all - weirdly obsessed with this song. 

Second of all - I always heard ""they're just girls"" meaning she's just a girl, not a woman, i.e. very young (he does say ""eyes bright"", meaning young and naive).

I guess the song is him saying he was hooking up with a young girl, but she, being young, took it as a relationship instead of just a hookup. He starts to get annoyed with her because she's clingy and she's acting like he's what she was looking for. But he realizes that she's just a young girl, and he needs to break it off.

@rebeccast 















My interpretation of this is that there's a 17 year old girl, that will be 18 in a few months. She flirting with the guy but the guy's brother said to stay away because she's too young seeing as the guys probably in his early 20's. Obviously he ignores his brother's advice.

She offers to have a one night stand or a short-lived fling, at first he doesn't want to because she's a stoned/drunk?/broken teenaged girl and he doesn't want to deal with her. He knows he shouldn't but he goes along with it and does the deed with her, multiple times. 

After a while he wants to end their fling because she's too much to handle and it was just a bit of fun anyway. He calls it off, breaking her heart but he said from the start that he was going to do that anyway. 

Personally, I love the 1975 and this album is absolutely perfect. My boyfriend bought it for me for my birthday because I really like them and this is honestly one of the best tracks. Great song.

There are many situations in this song. It's like a written contradiction. Since he says no to her, but yet he is just looking to fool around which goes against saying No to a partner. He is also saying that girls are only out to play games, ""Girls breaking hearts, etc.."" It's really difficult to put into an interpretation since it's a contracting song.

@James Dean 















I am in my mid 30's and when I first heard this song, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I was a stupid 16 year old, when I basically was exactly the girl he refers to here. I thought I had met the love of my life. Older guy, really cool, cute as hell. Instead of brother, it was my father who earned him off me. I used sex as a tool to manipulate him time and time again. Although he could of said no. I would flirt with men if I saw him in a club or pub to make him jealous and this unhealthy circle of being together, him telling me I'm too young to know what love is, us splitting then sex and together again, still breaks my heart when I think back. He used to feel bad and spend a ton of money on me. He had money, although he could have been penniless, I would not have cared. It was so toxic. I still see him now and again, mainly in Asda of all places. He once said to a mutual friend, he will never have such a passionate relationship ever again, the physical side we were perfect. He also said I'd fucked his head up. I think we both fucked each others heads up. If I had been slightly older, we would probably have been married and divorced within a year. I was not stupid enough to stop taking contraception, although I so much wanted his child. I am married now, in a non toxic relationship. I've seen the world, made mistakes, learnt from them. I am finally a woman not a girl. Any girls reading this, take heed of my story. It took a long time for me to stop hating him. I do truly believe you have to have genuinely love someone to feel so much hatred for a person. I finally realised, there is no need to hate him. I'm grateful of the times in the relationship when could really talk and we did have some fun times. He has a wife and two children now. Apparently she is a really nice person. The kids are the spit of him. I'm just happy we both managed to move on.

Everyone had great responses, but I find the dialogue in the song diffrent.

""I said no!""
 I actually think that's the guy telling the girl to chill. Saying NO BISH we're not having sex.
""oh give it a rest. I can persuade you.""
Thats the girl talking smiling at him all seductively trying to get him to do as hse pleases.
""I'm not your typical stoned 18 year old?
The guy trying to push her away.
""Give me a night I'll make you.""
That's her being really nasty and telling him that. In that moment he can't resist. Despite how young she is. 
 -Wrestle tot he ground-
they eventually get on the ground (if ya know what i mean)

befor eanything goes down he's like god help me now.

The song is not only about Miranda being there for Blake when he needed her it's about Miranda making him into a better person.
 At the time I am writing this, the two are no longer together and have both found new partners. That does not mean that they love each other any less. God gave Miranda to Blake just as God gave Blake to Miranda, they were put in each others lives to better one another and even if doing so it meant that they would divorce and no longer be together, they still both seem very happy in their new relationships.

Out of all of the sexy female empowerment hits that have come from Ariana Grande's album ""Sweetener,"" this song might be the sexiest and most empowering. I mean, it doesn't get much more empowering than calling yourself a deity. This song goes above and beyond glorifying female sexuality, as the singer tells her partner that she is going to rock their world so hard that they will believe that she must be a god. Then she incorporated religious imagery like prayer and blessings, really driving home the contrast between sex and religion. Beyond the lyrics, Ariana really plays up her slow, sensual singing style to make this song a fun and sexy hit that you might want to play while you're...well, replicating the lyrics.

God doesn't seem to be threatening or intimidating at all. 

In fact I don't think God is even present. It's a satyrical criticism of small-town christianity. They ignore everything that is going on around them, thinking themselves so self-righteous because they have God. 

The breeding 'all the kittens white' thing is clearly racial point. And they try to hide their prejudices by explaining that they 'have a woman for a mayor'.

The key to this song is the progression of the penultimate lines of each chorus: 
""No cause to worry now"" shows a blind confidence.
""And noone's left in doubt"" suggests more that there is doubt.
""Any day now he'll come out"" getting a little bit panicky
""Oh I wish he would come out"" could they be on their knees 'as quiet as a mouse' for something that isn't there.

If they were not surrounded by all of this degradation and sin then how do they no about it.

@suavisvinum 















One of my fave Cave songs at the moment, and he played it last night in Brighton, and messed up the words going into the ""Zero crime and no fear"" line, but recovered beautifully and with humour, and so that those who didn't know the song probably wouldn't have realised at all, although it raised a few cheers and jeers from those who did know the song. 

I have always seen it as an indictment of the kind of small-minded Parish provincial England town that I'm from, where the inhabitants care more for their cats than they do fellow human beings, and I think the song is a description of the kind of ""Daily Mail mindset"" that often prevails in such towns, hence the sensational/provocative language used in dscribing the ""homos roaming the streets in packs"", as if they were wild animals, and the ""queerbashers with tyrejacks"", and the humourous ""lesbian counterattacks"" - it is a description of the shock tactics that papers like the Daily Mail, the Daily Express, and many other of the top-selling British newspapers use to control middle England, and it is beautifully written.

The song seems to be sung from the perspective of one such inhabitant of such a town, whose blind faith in the ""God in the House"" seems to be waning with each passing chorus, so that by the end he or she is wishing that He would come out, either to prove His existence, or perhaps it is Cave himself wishing He would come out to show His real power and teach these people what life should really be about - not fearing such sensationalist rubbish as is fed to them through the media, but actually trying to help their society, rather than hide away from it in their well lit little town. 

Much of the lyrics are playful and humourous in their mocking of such towns, ""We have a tiny little Force, but we need them of course, for the kittens in the trees..."" and ""We have a pretty little square, we have a woman for a Mayor, our policy is firm but fair"", it's all wonderful stuff.  

I think the ""We've bred all our kittens white"" line probably does have racial connotations, although that only occurred to me recently, when I was talking to my fiancee about this song. I had previously just thought it an example of the paranoia of such people, who would only keep white cats, as they would be safest and least likely to get run over in traffic. 

If Cave is religious, and the article that another quoted is hardly concrete evidence to confirm that, he is still clearly poking fun at those who use religion as a thing to hide behind, as a place to hide away from real life, and from life's responsibilities. 

God bless all the Americans who think this is a literal song about a pretty little God-fearing town! Ha!

I'm sure you'd like to think of it as a critical view of small-town Christianity, which is a subject that's been the victim of satire for quite some time by many who barely understand it, but you must take into account that Nick Cave is a Christian himself, although he doesn't believe in an interventionist's God.

dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2004/11/18/cave/…

Anyway, Christianity has gotten a bad stereotype, but we're not all the homophobic rednecks you'd prefer to think we are.

@Killjoy192000 















It quite clearly is a criticism of small town christianity where people live with nothing but an overriding faith in God that causes them to have predjudices which they feel they can justify. That much is obvious from the lyrics, and Nick Cave may very well be a Christian but he certainly doesn't approve of what Christianity can become in some instances and that's been a theme throughout most of his album's, just have a read of the lyrics to Get Ready For Love if you really want it spelled out.

I disagree with that. Nick's lyrics are not so optimistic as you might think. Take this for example:

Homos [...] Queer bashers [...] Lesbian counter-attacks
That stuff is for the big cities

People in this ""pretty little town"" just don't care about ""homos"", ""crime"", ""freaks"", ""moral sneaks"" as far as they are *not* concerned. And if they *are* concerned, they choose the stupid way to deal with it: They are fighting with the ""crime"" whatever it is by lighting the fires - but they do not admit, that this ""crime"" is caused by *bad people* living there. In fact they want to hide it, by stating that they need a ""Force"" for the kittens on the trees.

I really don't think that God is present there.

@Smaug 















For me this song is not about whether God is present or not, it is about how many christians forget the real message of Jesus. Jesus himself spent a lot of time with those who were rejected from society, he even went so far to claim that that was one of his main purposes.
The people in Caves song are like the pharisees in the gospels, they reserve the holy for the righteous and successful. They think that God will punish them if they are associated with the rejects of society.
So basically God is in the House is a satirical portrait of self-righteous christians who have forgotten the message of the man/god they worship.

Or the Gods and Monsters are the people in the world of Hollywood. The Gods are the celebrities that are worshiped just because they are famous and everyone thinks they're so amazing. The Monsters are the addictions, sins and all of the trouble that comes along with being in that world - ""The garden of evil""

She was an angel because she was innocent when she was first brought into that world. She was already addicted to alcohol, but wanted fame and love.

Eventually she got into the world of the monsters and if she was addicted to things, her life with the Gods/Celebs would be over, but she still sings. She kept telling herself if God is dead, no one can take her soul away. When you're a celebrity, it takes your soul away in a sense because you have to grow up fast and your whole world changes and eventually you get into things that take the innocence away.

I suppose some people can't understand the meaning of metaphors or just simply using an artistic approach to explain a situation other than using bubbly pop catchy phrases to get your point across. I think the entire song is a metaphor about living a dirty lifestyle. ""I was an angel, living in the Garden of Evil."" ""Put your hands on my waist do it softly, me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing. No ones gonna take my soul away, I'm living like Jim Morrison."" Yup, party rocker promiscuous lifestyle just about sums it up.
While I understand the general public isn't use to hearing words like ""God's dead!"" in songs, it doesn't mean this artist is worshiping Satan. I see it as a way of saying ""Living a fucked up, care free life in a world where everyone is living like there is no such thing as sinning."" But, ""God's dead"" just about sums it up too if you have the ability to open your mind and wrap your brain around the possibility that some songs or lyrics aren't going to be straight forward and to the point.

			Thank you for the true words. But you missed the point she is quoting Nietzsche (""Gott ist tot"", ""god's dead""). It refers to a lifestyle based on Nihilsm.

To me this song is one of three things: fictitious, biographical or autobiographical. 

It could be pure fiction, a story of an unnamed young woman.

It could be biographical, most likely about Pamela Courson - Jim Morrison's love. Del Rey has written in the form of a persona before, so this wouldn't be totally unheard of. Born to Die is full of references to Lolita, from the 'heart-shaped sunglasses' of Diet Mountain Dew to the track Lolita itself. Moreover, in the video for National Anthem, Del Rey portrays both Marilyn Monroe and Jacqueline Kennedy. However, I am not fully convinced that the song is wholly about Courson.

Finally, it could be about Lana Del Rey herself - I think this is the most likely explanation. 

The song could also be a response to LA Woman by The Doors - at the very least there are some interesting allusions.

One thing, however, is certain. 'The land of Gods and Monsters' refers to LA.

I will now take it lyric by lyric.

'In the land of gods and monsters,
I was an angel.
Living in the garden of evil,
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed.'

The land of Gods and Monsters, as I have mentioned, refers to LA. For many, Los Angeles, and specifically Hollywood, is a sort of paradise, the culmination of the American Dream. 'The Gods' refers to the icons in LA - the Marilyn Monroes, the adored, the promise of what Hollywood has to offer. 'Monsters' refers to the vices that permeate LA, whether excessive wealth, drugs, alcohol or fame.

I was an angel - this could be a response to LA Woman, in which Morrison sings 'are you a lucky little lady in the city of light? Or just another lost angel?’ Del Rey answers that she was an angel. Her use of the past tense is significant. She is no longer an angel. This begs the question: what is she now? An angel would be expected to live under God. If she is no longer an angel it suggests she has succumbed to the dark side of LA - the monsters.

Living in the garden of evil - this is an obvious play on words - the Garden of Eden. In the Book of Genesis, the Garden of Eden was the paradise created by God for Adam and Eve. However, evil entered the Garden in the form of the snake, and tempted Eve to sin by eating the forbidden fruit. This is in keeping with the previous line - LA has become a place of evil and sin, it is no longer the paradise it appeared to be, and Del Rey has fallen from grace.

Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed - she has turned to the dark side of LA in order to survive - this could refer to alcohol and drugs (Del Rey has reportedly had alcohol problems in the past) or even prostitution, whether literal or metaphorical. (Del Rey has also alluded to prostitution in the video for Ride - however, I am in no way suggesting she has personal experience, it is merely part of the story of the song and the lifestyle that goes with it.)

Shining like a fiery beacon - this would seem to possibly be another reference to LA Woman, in which Morrison sings 'I see your hair is burning, hills are filled with fire'. Alternatively, beacons are often lit as a sign of distress - could it be a cry for help? Or is she burning bright, and will inevitably burn out.

You've got that medicine I need, 
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly - who is she speaking to here? Possibly the city itself. She has become addicted to the lifestyle in the city and all that comes with it.

Put your hands on my waist, do it softly - this is an image of seduction. She is still being drawn in to the city. Again, the question is raised – to whom is she speaking? Los Angeles or a specific person? Perhaps Morrison, who represents the dark side of life in LA for a troubled but brilliant artist.

Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing - if the land is one of 'Gods and Monsters', and she doesn't get along with God, that suggests she has joined or associates with the monsters. Again this comes back to the dark side of LA and the American Dream.

No one's gonna take my soul away,
I'm living like Jim Morrison - Del Rey will not compromise who she is or what she does. This is highly existential - she will live in the moment, true to herself. If that means being drawn to darkness, that's where she'll go. Morrison was the ultimate self-destructive artist. He lived on his own terms and could not be tamed or controlled. He was a poet, an artist, an intangible chameleon, a Dionysus. He did what he wanted and allowed others to pick up the pieces - which they inevitably did. He lived fast, and died young - a member of the infamous '27 club'. Ultimately his lifestyle got the better of him, and he died in Paris. In some ways his death could be seen as an escape - he was tired of the fame and the rock star persona, he wanted to be a serious artist and viewed his lyrics as poetry. However, he has been immortalised in his music. Perhaps this is why no one can take Del Rey's soul? She has poured it into her own music. Just like Morrison, she is living life on her own terms, full of the vice of LA, the 'monsters'.

Headed towards a fucked-up holiday - as mentioned above, Jim Morrison died in Paris. Does Del Rey see herself heading for a similar fate? 'Jim wanted to be like a shooting star; now you see him, now you don't, but for that brief moment he burns as the brightest star in the galaxy.' - Danny Sugerman, friend of Morrison. Is this line indicative of a death wish, much like Morrison?

Motel, sprees, sprees and I'm singing - this is a definite allusion to LA Woman, where Morrison sings 'Motel, money, murder, madness'. Both money and murder have connections with the word spree - a spending spree and a killing spree are both commonly recognised terms, and both indicate a form of insanity or 'madness', crazy excess, going overboard. This line is the strongest connection between LA Woman and Gods & Monsters.

Fuck, yeah, give it to me
This is heaven, what I truly want – she sounds like she is trying to convince herself of something, as though there is a gnawing  suspicion that something is still missing. She is taking on all of the excess LA can throw it her, and challenging to give more. Also, if LA is the land of Gods and monsters, then she feels like she is heaven when she has achieved everything she thinks it has to offer.

It’s innocence lost. 
Innocence lost. – this is in keeping with the line ‘I was an angel’. She has been corrupted by the land of Gods and monsters.

In the land of gods and monsters, 
I was an angel, lookin' to get fucked hard. – again, Del Rey suggests that she was an angel, innocent and naïve. However, she was looking for trouble and looking for fulfillment outside herself. She wasn’t looking to ‘fuck hard’, she was looking to ‘get fucked hard’. This requires another person. Her happiness depends on an external factor, she is incomplete. This is in keeping with a lifestyle of fame – she needs to feel loved by others.

Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer,
Life imitates art – this line seems to be autobiographical. Del Rey sees herself more as a groupie, following the famous ones rather than being a famous one herself. She cannot quite believe that the world has bought the lie that she is a true artist; she doesn’t feel worthy or that she is one. She went to LA and was catapulted into this position, and any moment the rug will be pulled out from under her.

You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up straight to the heart please – now the medicine has changed from the previous reference. All that matters now is the drugs, and the dose is intense – straight to the heart. She needs a greater and greater fix in order to survive.

I don't really wanna know what's good for me – she knows this lifestyle isn’t good for her, and people have tried to tell her; perhaps her parents in her days of alcohol abuse? However, she is shutting that part of herself off, she doesn’t want to face reality. The 

God's dead, I said 'baby that's alright with me' – This could be a reference to Nietzsche, who famously declared ‘God is dead.’ Nietzsche was referring to the fact that the modern world has in many ways made God redundant. Could Del Rey be suggesting that she doesn’t need God as long as she’s in LA and living the dream? She has replaced God with her lifestyle. Also, if this is the land of Gods and Monsters, and God’s dead, she has now entirely moved to the dark side of the lifestyle, only the monsters remain. Before she didn’t get along with God, but he was still around. Now he’s entirely gone.

No one’s gonna take my soul away,
Living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I’m singing,
Fuck yeah give it to me, this is heaven, what I truly want
It's innocence lost. 
Innocence lost. – see above for chorus.

When you talk it's like a movie and you're making me crazy – who is she talking to here? Again the theme of movies is in keeping with LA and Hollywood. Like a movie implies an idyllic existence and has romantic connotations, which links back to the earlier image of seduction.

Cause life imitates art – a repetition of an earlier line. She has become immersed in art and the façade of LA.

If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard. – she feels the pressure to conform to the expectations of her lifestyle, and doesn’t feel worthy as she is. She is looking to be the best version of herself, but only superficially. The person she is speaking to tells her life isn’t that hard, again, a very simplistic view.

No one’s gonna take my soul away,
I'm living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I’m singing,
Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is heaven, what I truly want.
It's innocence lost.
Innocence lost.

@GNRLoves Ahh I'm not done reading your interpretation yet, which is great so far. But had to stop to point out ""land of gods and monsters"" is NOT LA. La is the city of angels she goes to after all the hell on earth.

I think some of the lyrics in this song have a hint of sarcasm in them. Like when she sings, ""I was an angel lookin to get fcked hard."" I think she is saying a lot of guys hit on her and kind of told her she was just asking for it. And when she sings, ""this is heaven, what I truly want,"" she is trying to convince herself that it is. and she finally gives in to the liquor and sex and what not. and I think when she sings, 'no one's gonna take my soul away,"" that was something someone said to convince her to give into sin.

@Blondelle80 















i find this song quite enigmatic, but here i go with what i think about it. 
i think it all revolves in the lines ""its innocence lost, innocence lost"", the lyrics start saying that in the land of gods and monsters she was an angel living in the garden of evil. its about this girl, full of innocence and purity that lives in this evil place. she gets consumed by life there full of drugs, alcohol, sex and ends living 'like jim morrison'. she then realizes that god is 'dead' as she stopped being that innocent and pure 'angel' she had been. she also says that no one s gonna take my soul away because of her new lifestyle but shes so consumed by this world that she dosent care anymore.

well hope you like my point of view :) bye and thanks! realtruth.

This song, at least on the surface, is about the internal conflict many people face about the temptations or 'sin' of the world.  These include drugs, sex, and other typical things that come with fame (think sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll).  She takes these and sexualizes them in an analogy throughout several lines;

""fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly""

In the chorus, she's kidding herself (or whoever the narrator is);

""No one's gonna take my soul away"" is her way of saying that despite all the things she does, she will still be that ""angel"", or at least she hopes she will.  However, by the end of the chorus, she's admitted the truth; all of this has taken away her innocence.

Also in the chorus, she mentions ""living like Jim Morrison"".  Jim Morrison's life was plagued by drug abuse and a lot of sex with groupies.  I believe when she says ""headed towards a fucked up holiday"", she is referring to the date of his death, July 3rd.  This is obviously right before the America's Independence Day, July 4th.  Both Morrison and Lana Del Rey are American, so this is appropriate.  This life she is living will one day lead to her death.

The religious theme throughout I'm not really sure about.  Gods and monsters could represent the seemingly prominent figures in the music industry, or other people in her surroundings.  God isn't painted as a caring one in this song, but one of destruction, wrath, and conflict with Lana.  She wants to think of herself as an angel among monsters, but she's really not that innocent.

			Could God not be her conscience? And could the sin (drugs, adultry, gambling...anything that causes harm) not be the monsters? One is supposedly beautiful while the other is ugly. One brings peace while the other brings turmoil. I'm not sure, but it sounds plausible to me.

Why does everyone have to argue over something that they nor no one knows the true meaning in behind? WHO CARES. Just because you voiced an opinion over another's and it is contrary to their's doesn't mean anything. Your opinion over another's does not mean you are MORE CORRECT.

The beauty in this song is that it can mean something so different to every person. THAT is what great songs are meant to do. Inspire. Create. Shake you up. Make you think. It should mean something different to every person who listens to it. To sit around and correct people on their interpretation is just silly. Even if you are/ may be right, fine. What did you get for it? A sense of accomplishment from someone ""out there you've never met"" commenting the same way you are that you don't even know?? Sad. 

Just live, share your thoughts if you so choose to, and let others do just the same.

			But what did you get from posting this? A sense of accomplishment that you put someone out there, that you've never met, in their place? Sad.								

Does anyone else hear ""speed sprees"" instead of ""sprees sprees""? 

My interpretation of the lyrics 

""No one’s gonna take my soul away"" = There is no God (or Devil) to take me to the afterlife. Living in the now. 
""Living like Jim Morrison."" = Living fast and hard, pretty direct meaning.
""Headed towards a fucked up holiday."" = Getting ""fucked up"" aka high/drunk/etc and doing ""fucked up"" things double entendre.
""Motel, sprees, sprees, and I’m singing,"" = Painting a picture of sleazy (motel) sex and reckless drinking / drug use
""Fuck yeah give it to me, this is﻿ heaven, what I truly want"" = Ties back into the religious themes + the notion that life on earth is the only ""heaven"" we get. To the narrator that heaven happens to be casual sex. Can be interpreted as regretful or reckless abandon.  
""It's innocence lost. Innocence lost."" = self explanatory


""In the land of gods and monsters,I was an angel."" = Some have said this is to indicate that she was once pure. I see this as using tongue in cheek religious imagery to convey that she was beautiful or an object of attention for the ""Gods and monsters"" aka her sexual encounters
""Living in the garden of evil"" = Play on words of ""Garden of Eden"" perhaps to convey ""living in sin""
""Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed."" = self explanatory
""Shining like a fiery beacon"" = Again the notion that she is desirable or an object of attention, perhaps because of her innocence (a beacon for the gods and monsters)
""You got that medicine I need Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly.
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly."" = her experiences, what she wants or thinks she wants
""Me and God we don’t get along, so now I sing."" = Doesn't believe in god or religion ... NOT that she is a worshiper of satan or the illuminati /eyeroll


""I was an angel, lookin' to get fucked hard."" = Literally and figuratively (sex, but also being used, emotional abuse)
""Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer,
Life imitates art"" = She became something by claiming to be it
""You got that medicine I need Dope, shoot it up straight to the heart please"" = Encapsulates the need of drug addiction but also potentially a metaphor for Love or addiction to the concept of love.
""I don't really wanna know what's good for me"" = Doesn't want people telling her how to live, or even to listen to her own doubts about her lifestyle.
""God's dead, I said 'baby that's alright with me'."" = Indifference toward religion, or perhaps the death of religious values in modern society.


""When you talk it's like a movie and you're making me crazy,
'Cause life imitates art."" = Not really sure how the life imitates art fits in here - maybe because the person she is talking to represents a movie character and he drives her crazy in the same way the character does.
""If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?"" = Desperation for love and the fixation on physical beauty.
""You tell me life isn't that hard."" = A carefree idealism (which sums up the song)

In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel (WAS meaning she doesn't feel she is anymore because of addiction, and when I say she, I don't exactly mean Lana)
Living in the garden of evil (Which is Earth, because there are so many evil things around us each day like drugs, alcohol and other sins.)
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed (You do anything you need to do for the things you are addicted to)
Shining like a fiery beacon

You got that medicine that I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly 
Put your hands on my waist do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing
(She could feel that she doesn't get along with God because she has become addicted to many things and isn't innocent anymore and could possibly blame God for that happening to her or she could have lost belief due to sins and the way the world she lives in is. OR maybe ""me"" isn't exactly herself, but actually the monsters - addictions, sex, drugs, alcohol, etc. She sings now to get all of her emotions out about it)

No one's gonna take my soul away
Living like Jim Morrison
Heading towards a fucked up holiday
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing
(No one can take her soul away because of her sins if she doesn't believe in God anymore or if she has no relationship with him anymore. Obviously some have commented about Jim Morrison, she's living like him in the fact that of the drugs and sex. Heading towards death because of her wild lifestyle)

Fuck yeah, give it to me
This is heaven
What I truly want
Is innocence lost?
Innocence lost?
(She's saying give it all to her because it's heaven to her. If it were about being addicted to drugs, if you have the drugs you are needing then it's heaven to you at the time. It is possible that she's being sarcastic about it. ""What I truly want"" It's probably not really what she wants. She's asking if her innocence lost because she wants to be herself again. She doesn't want to be addicted and sin, but it's too late.)

In the land of Gods and Monsters
I was an angel
Looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito
Posing as a real singer
Life imitates art


You got that medicine that I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said 'Baby that's alright with me'
(When she started out in the ""land of gods and monsters"" celebrity world (LA/Hollywood) she was only looking for fame, liquior and love, but now she's gotten into darker things such as drugs and have become addicted to the monster.) 
No one's gonna take my soul away
(she keeps telling herself that because it's better to believe that you're sinning and going to hell, i suppose)
Living like Jim Morrison
Heading towards a fucked up holiday
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing

Fuck yeah, give it to me
This is heaven
What I truly want
Is innocence lost?
Innocence lost?

When you talk, it's like a movie and you're making me crazy
'Cause life imitates art

If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard
(She doesn't believe it's not that hard because she's struggling)

No one's gonna take my soul away
Living like Jim Morrison
Heading towards a fucked up holiday
Motel, sprees, sprees, and I'm singing

Fuck yeah, give it to me
This is heaven
What I truly want

I could be way off, but that's just some of how I feel. I don't really know the full meaning of it, but definitely about struggling with addiction.

@shiribehrx 















I have no much experience in analysing songs or poetry and I see many contemporary/pop songs as only throwing “catchy” phrases at the listener, which is not suppose to make sense. However “Gods and Monsters” made me think a bit (apart from it being a catchy song; the slow beat and unforceful singing is effective; and considering that there might e no real meaning, just having a “fun” with words). 

But here goes. The title Gods and Monsters imply that this God is not a nice person/entity. There is no craving towards “God”, but rather an escape from “God”. Was an angle, thus was with “God” but not anymore. Escaped from the clutches or control…

The song can be seen as a parody, making life seem worse than it is, but some of the lyrics sounds almost sarcastic:.“Give it to me…that’s what I truly want” can read “do you honestly think this is what I want or what makes me happy?” 

The line “If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?” has a very sad undertone. 

I translate “innocence lost” as “not naÃ¯ve any more”. Her eyes opened to what’s really happening and then do not want to give her soul to the “God(s)” of the evil “city of lights”. Living care free life (like Jim Morrison), living away from the “God” and the evil “city”, but knowing it won’t last. There is only a temporary escape, but the end will come. The evil City with its trappings of money and fame will eventually swallow her. The carefree her will die, when she violate her principles and become part of the evil city of money, fame and greed.

The “reference to life imitates art” is interesting. We create art, but then we follow our own creation. Instead that art mirrors us; we copy the art (from music, TV, movies). 

There is possible two paragraphs woven into one. On the one hand the angel standing out in the garden of evil and then eventually falling out with “the God” (clearly a metaphor). The other describing the insecurity in the garden, using the “medicine” to cope, but the end is near.

""In the land of gods and monsters,
I was an angel.
Living in the garden of evil,
Shining like a fiery beacon,
Me and god we don’t get along, so now I sing.

Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed.
You got that medicine I need;
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly.
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly.""

Defiance and temporary escape, but knowing it is temporary. The “death” that follows when she betrays her morals and conscience for money fame and fortune, is evident. 

""No one’s gonna take my soul away,
Living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday...""

Incredible song. It's honestly one of my favorites that he's sung. I think he's trying to get across the idea of sometimes at the beginning of a relationship, things are good and nice and happy but after awhile the fire begins to dim and it's not 'good' or meaningful anymore. 

Or it could mean that things we think are good may not actually be that great. Like things that are coated in happiness and lies(like being a singer or actor) when in reality it's stressful and scary.

Ahh, Conway how you understand me. This song for the party that is always left, aka myself, really hits home. Sorry for the bit of self-deprecation, but if you really feel this song, I feel for you. The first time i heard this I was bawling on the freeway. Anyway, it's pretty straight forward, and if I can remark interesting hearing the song was sung by a male because generally speaking the man is the one who wants his freedom.
Anyway, here's my interpretation...

""Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep staring at the door"" 
The other party doesn't want to fight anymore for their love. She just thinks the grass will be greener away from the narrator. The singer just wants them to work on it, everything they did together is memorable and amazing, and just because things are different or tough doesn't mean he wants to give up. 

""If being free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time"" 
The narrator realizes no matter how much he loves this person, if they want to go they will go. And in the process he will need to cut them off, goodbye, not see you later, because if her freedom matters more to her than him, he knows  he stands.

""If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun, what else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway.""
The narrator is saying if he had known this would happen, and the other party would so easily walk away, he would've passed on the relationship. But he's still selfless when he uses ""we"", because he still feels like she shouldn't be in pain either. And my favorite line in the song...""If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway."" He knows there's nothing he can say to keep her. If she doesn't feel it, doesn't love him, doesn't want to work for it, there's nothing he can do.

""Goodbye baby""
And at the end of the song he says goodbye. Affectionately with ""baby"", but he knows she just don't care or love him anymore, so he has to leave because he still loves her.

I'm surprised there are no comments on this song - the chords, rhythm, and lyrics are all very cool the way they differentiate and still blend so well. 
The lyrics themselves are pretty self explanatory - its the intense moment you lose yourself with that person....the chase, the catch, and so on. Very good song, The songs are always sung with so much passion and Bruno always sings with such a purity to his voice alone....one of my favorites from the album.

Oh I got a bottle full of liquor with a cocaine 
Kicker and I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
(He had a hefty amount of liquor/drugs thus him feeling of him feeling ""30 FT tall"")

You got your legs up in the sky with the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now
(Self explanatory her eyes are full of lust and well her legs are probably wrapped around his neck.)

Look what you doing, look what you done
But in this jungle you can't run
'Cause what I got for you
I promise is a killer, you'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla
(He is being the dominate one and is promising her for 'killer sex')

You and me baby making love like gorillas
You and me baby making love like gorillas
(self explanatory just look up gorillas mating)

Yeah I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling tell me daddy it's yours
(She's acting naughty for his own self pleasure)

'Cause you know how I like it use a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops, call the sheriff
Call the swat we don't stop 
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming give it to me baby
Give it to me motherfucker
(He means their going to be making a lot of noise and they don't care about the disturbance of their neighbors)

Oh look what you doing, look what you done
But in this jungle you can't run
'Cause what I got for you
I promise is a killer, you'll be banging on my chest
Bang bang, gorilla 

You and me baby making love like gorillas
You and me baby making love like gorillas

I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You'll never be the same baby once I'm done with you
(This is his point of view watching the woman having an orgasam) 

Oh you with me baby making love like gorillas
You and me baby we'll be fuckin' it like gorillas
You and me baby making love like gorillas

Very self explanatory song. Two lovers/ or whatever they may be/ making love to eachother I don't honestly think it needs a explanation does it :)

I know this song has a tendency to be misinterpreted and everyone thinks it's all about sex, but really it's all about Bruno's addiction to M&M's. He has a pretty detailed history about it and he makes it clear how much he loves them, especially the peanut butter ones...

Just kidding, this song is totally about sex. Soooooo hot! I think we've all been there. Sometimes making love is nice and slow and sensual, but this song is all about tapping into that primal urge to just pound the hell out of each other.

The song is about the classic meaningless of making more and more money and working till you die without any larger rhyme or reason. The video expands on this a bit and criticizes entertainment as a source of this monotonous consumerism and capitalism, hence the zombies and hitler and lots of killing and sex. It's all shot in bathrooms because all of this rehashed entertainment is *shit*, garbage in garbage out, hence the toilets.

I'm going with somebody doing illegal stuff, maybe like working with mobsters to make some money and get rich fast. 

""See the money wanna stay
For your meal
Get another piece of pie
For your wife""

Sounds to me like someone working under the table, doing illegal things, like maybe with the mob for ""a piece of the pie.""  ""See the money wanna stay"": He sees how good the money is and doesn't want to leave.  He makes sure he shares the wealth, stays long enough so his wife also gets ""a piece of the pie."" 


""Everybody wanna know
How it feel
Everybody wanna see
What it's like""

Everyone wants to know how it feels to be rich, everyone wants a taste of wealth.


""For baby wanna be a queen
Well alright
We all deserve the finer things
In this life""

Wife wants to be treated like a queen perhaps?  He's justifying what he's doing for money because he's saying his wife, himself, maybe family and friends deserve the fineries in life.


""So working on a little job
In the night
That's forty dollars an hour when I
See the light

The boss said I look tired
I don't mind
He'll be working in a small box
'Til he die""

Boss says he looks tired during his day job because this guy's working hard, pulling in greenbacks (slang for money) during the night.  Illegal activity.  But he doesn't care what his boss says, his boss will just be working at the same cubicle office job for the rest of his life.


""For me I gotta be free
All my life
I want a little cream cheese
In my pie""

Wants more than he has.  Not just the pie, he wants to add more flavor to his life.  Maybe now he's in over his head.  Wealth is getting to him.


""Now puttin' on a big wig
Walkin' hall
Hanging with them big pigs
Huff and toss""


Being fancy and hanging with the big guys now (I'm going with mobsters)  Not sure of the slang meaning of ""huff and toss.""



""Got me a couple ideas straight from God
I want a bean pie
Order me a bean pie
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind
Me and Missy is so early busy busy makin' money""

Not too sure about what this means.

Yes, ""greenback"" means money.  And ""huff"" and ""toss"" are both synonyms for puke.  It seems he's blowing his ill-gotten gains on excessive partying.

			 I saw this video of him dragging the piano uphill and singing about how he would ""take a granade for ya"". How his love was so great that he would sacrifice himself for ya. I wonder if Bruno Mars saw the Christian the symbolic nature of the video and if not, did anyone else see it.... I know saw it and immediately thought of Christ dragging the cross uphill to make the ultimate sacrifice for my sins and the world. At one point in the video, he is harrassed by a street gang and ridiculed and I thought of Christ, again. How He humbled Himself to ordinary men when He could have stopped it at any time. He went through it all and died for us so that we may live through Him. Most will definitely see it as a love song for a girl while I see IN it a love song for the world. Who would have thunk it?

When I first listened to this song, I also took it to mean that he's singing about a girl he's in love with and she just takes him for granted and abuses him in so many ways, and yet he can't let her go.

However, after listening to it a few times and really thinking about what the lyrics could actually mean, I believe it's not so much about a man who loves, in his words, a ""bad woman,"" but instead about a man who is completely obsessed with this woman.

You can see this right in the very beginning when he says he should have known she was this way because she had her eyes open during their first kiss. He asks why were her eyes open, but the only way he would know hers were open is if his were also open. Him saying that should have been the signal she was bad seems a little obsessive and almost threatening. I can almost hear the persona from the song cornering this woman and aggressively asking ""why were your eyes open?? why didn't you close your eyes??""

Next he says that all he ever wanted was for her to give him ALL of her love, and that's it. ""I just wanted you to love me unconditionally. Why couldn't you do that for me??"" 

The chorus goes on to say he would do all of these things for this woman (intercepting a grenade, jumping in front of a train, getting shot in the head) and it's a little too obsessive. Imagine if you were to just start seeing someone and after two weeks s/he was already saying they would die for you and they don't want to live unless it's with you. Granted, we don't know exactly how long the characters have been together, but it's still a very unhealthy way to look at a relationship.

So really, to me, it sounds like this man came on too strong to this girl in the early part of the relationship and she felt uneasy and maybe that she was in danger, so she decided to stop seeing him. As a result, we hear the story of an extremely sick and obsessive man wondering why she couldn't feel the same way about him as he did about her.

@wonderlust_ You took the words out of my mouth.			

First I love this song and this video is soooo awesome. I wish they didn't give him that haircut though! 

The song means the obvious but the video has lots of metaphors that I can't bypass because they put the lyrics' meaning on display. There is this guy who is very heart broken (suicidal) and the pain inside is the weight (piano) he drags around. This pain is weighing him down. As he is passing through this forsaken (poor neighborhood) road of heart ache he is alone. He encounters threats to his life- his own thoughts seem deadly, they are the tattooed thugs you see. They look dangerous and deadly and this being a metaphor for how his own thinking is trying to kill himself-threatening his life. His mind is telling him, die, kill oneself. He passes the thugs unharmed but frightened because his own thinking frightens him. Then when those thoughts subside the pity thoughts for the self starts this being the old man/hobo that runs at him and pointing at him mocks and laughs. You are an idiot how could you love her, she hates you and you want to kill yourself for that?"" Some times when you are in that kind of pain ( I have) you'll tell yourself ""ah you are fucking stupid, why do you feel this way?"" Or you'll say things like "" I cant believe you feel this numb, you are wasting away gosh you are an idiot!"" Next point cars and people ( a woman dressed in all black) pass him aware but uncaring or oblivious to him and his pain/weight. Then comes up to the house where the stupid bitch has her man whore. Here is all the things he is singing about, he would do anything for her, even look for her carrying the piano, thus, this and what follows sets the entire lyrics into place. He looks up and sees them-realizing there is no going back, he then lowers his eyes then his head. Right then deciding to end it. He drags away that piano, as the pain deepens and the weight (life) becomes unbearable-he can barely push the piano on such steep uphill climb- the weight is going to crush him if he doesn't hold it. And the moment of death appears when the nun and the Priest slowly pass looking. Religion and God seem significant when crossing that road. Flashing red lights means extreme danger, train crossing means crossing over to the other side, him and his pain/piano/weight are right on the tracks and faces the end. The reason why he has the piano on the tracks is that this whole time the piano wasn't a material thing outside of him, it was the pain inside him which can not be separated ( cannot be left outside the tracks) and it must die with him.

""The chorus is fantastic."" ROFL you are kidding me right?  

THIS is what the our dumbed down current/future generations find to be lyrically/emotionally poetic?  May god have mercy on us all.  Anybody who actually thinks these lyrics are emotional is even worse than those who can't even understand what the song means.  The fact that you understand the line ""I'd catch a grenade for  you"" means literally what it says, and associate ""fantastic"" with it, means you are a culturally bereft and intellectually stymied moron.

			The current/future generations are going to like what they want regardless of how you feel about it. Pop music isn't usually deep. It's just fun music. Not everything has to have a message. But yeah, the people on here thinking he's talking about Jesus or something are most likely wrong.

I haven't seen the video, but when I hear a song as unambiguous as this, I like to think of it in the situation of an ""unreliable narrator"" so they say.
I'm reluctant to hate this woman he's singing about until I know the singer's trustworthy. The listener doesn't actually have any proof that this singer isn't a crazy stalker who pursues the woman desperately against her wishes.
Certain lyrics, like ""why were they open""...I can imagine that he forced a kiss on her and she's afraid to refuse him. Same with ""You said you loved me, you're a liar"", as she felt scared of him so said she loved him to appease him.
The fact that she wouldn't catch a grenade or jump in front of a train for the singer (as he would for her) becomes a lot more justifiable if this is some psychotic stranger who she just wants to leave her alone. 
When he says lines like how she'd watch him burn or smile and pull out the brakes of his car, that is a ""would scenario"" that he is telling us; we have nothing to go on that she did do this, and this is purely his speculation that she would be so cruel.
So I just think its interesting that, however plain and simple this song seems (while being amazing and emotional at the same time), it could represent something totally different if you look at it another way.

			It sounds just plain unhealthy to me. As soon as I heard the lyrics I was thinking the same thing as you. Also, I don't think it's right to demand that kind of devotion from someone. He's acting as if her (reported) lack of a natural inclination to endure physical harm for him is a conscious choice, and she's essentially somehow ""unfaithful"" because of it. Also, you say she might have kissed him or said she ""loved"" him to appease him, but maybe she wasn't even trying to appease. Maybe she was cornered by the guy? Also, there are all sorts of ways someone can mean ""I love you,"" and in addition, feelings can change or wane. I might say I ""love"" someone if s/he makes me laugh a lot or something. That certainly doesn't mean I'm *in love* with him/her. Alternatively, what if she loved him once but no longer does and Mr. Creepy Stalker can't get that through his head? I think that's the reading more cool-headed listeners are getting out of it...

I don't care how charming he might be-- if a guy started saying stuff like that to me (and seriously meant it), my first inclination would be to run far, far away.

The meaning behind this song is rather straight forward. he threw his heart on his sleeve and she took it for granted. she is thought of as hellish at one point in the song ""Tell the devil I said hey when you get back to where you're from."" basically he wants her love and would do anything for her but she doesn't care.

@chuchathmar While I can see where you could get the thought that this is a song about how christ was willing to give his life for ours, there are many lyrics in this song that do not match up to that theory. For instance the way he is constantly calling this person ""baby"", or the lyrics ""Should have known you was trouble from the first kiss Had your eyes wide open, Why were they open?"", which show it was about a woman who was never actually in love with this man. I don't mean to sound like an *ssh*le, but not everything is directly related to christ, christianity, or god. Christians just need to realize that, and accept that not everything they are going to like will be considered ""christlike"" like they so desperately want it to be.

This is a true story: Greta hippie-looking, kinda groovy  bartender in Athens, waaaaay back in the day. I think Jojo used to date her. She had an episode where an intruder tried to break into her house one night...she was alone and only had her dog to protect her. Pissed off (In a fighting mood) at the intruder (who attempted to climb in through her bedroom window after ""pawing"" at the front door and finding it locked), she sicked her dog on him. The dog mauled the intruder's face, leaving him hospitalized. Greta was ticketed and got into trouble for the incident by her landlord. Her gun was confiscated after the incident.

""His fist is big but my gun's bigger 
He'll find out when I pull the trigger.""


It's a great song which they can't play on the radio because there are women whos husbands/boyfriends beat them and they might just go off and kill them...

			What?!?! not played on the radio!?!?  But that is where I keep hearing it being played time and time again.  Where are you that they do not play it?

I love this part: ""I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun 
Wait by the door and light a cigarette 
If he wants a fight well now he's got one 
And he ain't seen me crazy yet 
He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll 
Don't that sound like a real man 
I'm going to show him what a little girls made of 
Gunpowder and lead""

Omg, I love this song. It's so powerful. Little Girls are also of kerosene. Ha!

			Yes, I also like ""His fist is big, well my gun's bigger. He'll find out when I pull the trigger!""
I hope every man who beats anyone gets some kind of punishment.

Gunpowder and Lead has already helped so many woman fight and escape from domestic violence. Woman are strong and if he hits you, he is definitely not the kind of man you want in your life. Trust me, you'll find a better one.
Until then, stay strong girl!

@wideopenspaces 















This song is a glorification of domestic violence.  It's written right in the lyrics, ""He ain't seen me crazy yet.""  That there implies that she has already done acts which the man in the song would consider crazy, but she herself doesn't.  This song is completely without context, he slaps her face and shakes her like a rag doll, so she commits premeditated murder.  Thereby escalating the situation, a situation which she had already placed under control by having him arrested, all the woman in the song would need to do is call the police and say, ""I don't feel safe since he's out of jail, I'm afraid that he'll come after me."" and they'll come and watch out and make sure everything is safe.  By admitting that she is heading home to load her shotgun she is admitting that she is waiting for him so she can kill him.  This song is atrocious and should be taken off the air because it glorifies domestic abuse.

			You have a totally laughable and glorified idea of what law enforcement and the criminal justice system can do. You really think the cops are going to come out and babysit someone for an indeterminate amount of time based on a concern she has about something that may or may not actually happen? You really think they're going to come and hang out around your house for the next 5-7 years until the dude leaves town or goes back to prison? Or longer if he decides to stick around? HA! By the way, I work in the field.

In general, cops are hard-working and compassionate folks, but they are BUSY. Even in the smallest quietest town, you may get an hour or two of a cop hanging around,  but as soon as someone creams a cow on the highway or comes home to a burglary, they gotta go. Relying on police/fire dept etc to save your a** in every situation is completely foolish. Every cop and firefighter and EMT in the world will tell you this. 

I'm not for murder by any means, but I'll tell you, I've seen lots of women murdered by their abusive husband/boyfriend. Most of the time, the abuse has been reported to police, there are restraining orders in place. There's only so much other people can do for you. A restraining order is by no means a guarantee of safety. A restraining order just means they may get a few more days in jail added to their Murder I sentence when they violate the 50 yard stay away zone and shoot you in the face.  By the way, I have yet to see a man killed in a DV situation. I know it happens, but rare. Surprising considering how long this song has been on the radio, brainwashing us all. 

But all of this aside, I get your point. You see, I used to be a happy well-adjusted person. Then I started listening to country music. I found out my husband was cheating so I beat the crap out of his car with a bat causing thousands of dollars of damage. I later shot him in the face with a shotgun when he was released from prison for beating me. I then led police on a high-speed chase through a corn field with a beer in the console. After I got locked up, I broke out of prison with a witty and complicated plan that involved dogs mating. However, I was heartbroken that I lost my love and drank myself to death with whiskey. I now haunt the sandy beaches of Cheyenne, Wyoming. 

Damn country music, and their crazy stories! Who knows what will happen when I discover death metal?!?!

			Oh and by the way, I know your next response will likely be - just break the cycle! Just leave! Of course, again, I am not advocating that every DV victim should kill their attacker. However, the whole ""just call the cops and leave him! He will go to jail for a long time and and the cops will protect you every minute of the day and everything will be rainbows and happiness and safety!"" is utter horse s***. First of all, most people convicted of DV don't spend much time in the slammer at all. 

I'd also like to see you leave behind your children, and the only source of income you've had for the past 10 years, without any real skills or education to compete in a fierce job market. This is often the reality of many victims of DV. Besides, many of the women who are able to leave their abusers are stalked. You don't ""just leave!"" If it was that easy DV wouldn't be the huge problem it is. I'll tell you, we deal with a local battered women's shelter often. The address is top secret, and I've had to deal with very belligerent men doing their best to get it so they know where their victim is.

			Yeah right, call the cops.  The number of dead women who called the cops and got that restraining order tells me how useful that is.  I listen to a show called 911 and it was made clear how useless that is.  The women told the operator that an unknown stranger was breaking into her apartment and the operator spent 4 minutes repeatedly asking her if she was sure that she did not know who was breaking into her apartment.  Finally informed the cops to go to her address and then spent the 8 minutes (that it took the cops to arrive to her parking lot ) telling the woman to hide but keep her land line phone with her and put the gun that she took out of the locked box down on the floor of the closet.  The cops finally arrive and can not find the way to her apartment in the compound.  NOW THE OPERATOR ASK how to get to her apartment in the compound  (not in the 8 minutes that it took the cops to get there so that they would know which entrance was closest) and let the man who just walked into her bedroom hear where she is (as if the cord of the phone was not telling enough.)  The man opens the closet pulls the lady out (leaving her 8 year old with the gun) and starts beating and strangling the woman (all the while the operator is demanding that the screaming woman tell her what is happening to her.)  Finally, the cops come in to the apartment and eventually rescue the woman ( if the operator had immediately sent the cops the stranger would never have had time to reach her but no.....the Operator had to sure that the person breaking in was a stranger by repeatedly demanding the victim convince her of that fact before she sent the cops.)

Cops are not there to protect anyone person but to uphold the law and protect themselves first.  The number of times that they let people be murdered as they decide how to get themselves there without being harmed themselves......

			*sigh* No, it's not. You're an idiot and a self-righteous, pompous jackass. Ignoring the fact that you obviously have no experience or real knowledge about these kinds of situations (or that you may just be that stupid and honestly think that, in spite of your experience, that this is the way to respond...) I'm going to address your ridiculously asinine interpretation of this song: 

""That there implies that she has already done acts""  

... No, you dolt. Listen again and try -thinking- this time. ""He wants a fight, well, now he's got one"" implies that she hasn't fought back at all up until this point. ""He ain't seen me crazy yet"" implies the same thing. The reason why she's going to fight back? The reason she's gone ""crazy"" (with fear)? She believes he's about to come home to kill her. That's implied in the fourth line of the song.  

Now, she's already tried to get the authorities to handle it for her. She's proven to the police that he is an abuser, as evidenced by the fact that he was locked up in jail ... however, as in most abuse cases, he was only put away for a short amount of time and rather than convincing him to stop, it only made him angrier. Again, reinforcing the fact that he's going to KILL HER. 

So. She's decided that, if he's going to come back to get rid of her and if the law is going to just let him go to do it, then no one's going to save her and she has to save herself. That is exactly what her plan is: Self-defense. Understand this, she is not hunting him down. This is not premeditated murder. She is waiting for him to come attack _her_. 

If I knew someone was coming to attack me and I knew the police weren't going to stop them, it would be well within my rights to arm myself and be prepared. You're probably also assuming that these two are married ... but one of the lines in the song implies this place, where she is, is her own home and that this is her boyfriend, not her husband. So, by that logic: He's breaking into her home when she clearly does not want him there and he does not have permission to be there... and he's doing it with the intent to do her bodily harm. 

Once again: Self-defense.

"
436,Guns For Hands.json,"
This is my semi-detailed breakdown:

An interesting thing to note is the happy music with the lyrics about depression. I believe when analyzing the lyrics, he does this because people that carelessly listen to the song will not understand it. It requires deep thought. Depression also requires non depressed people to understand the disorder before they can help. 
The beginning of the song has to do with depression and self harm and the thoughts of suicide most depressed people constantly have. 
The 1st part talks about the morning after a night of cutting, and the common lie to loved ones to stop.
The 2nd part is obvious. Constant suicidal idealization and going back and forward on the idea of suicide.
The 3rd part explains that he is concerned about not just his own depression and suicide, but every one else that's depressed. Now the song becomes more about the lack of help/aid depressed people get.
The 5th part is an attempt to let this song be the stepping stone into coming together and start helping this epidemic. It also says that depression wont get better if you become a recluse (you have to take action).  
The 8th part (the rap verse) is confusing. I think the first half is specifically aimed at non depressed people and trying to explain to them what the deal is with depression (showing that he also deals with it). In the other half he explains that his lyrics are trying to turn the guns (suicidal thoughts) into fists (to fight their disorder).  

This is my opinion! Let me know if you disagree with anything :)

@MashedPE i agree with everything you said, EXCEPT for the rap verse part. in my opinion, hes saying that he wants the suicidal kids/ people to stop harming themselves and that he rathers that they hurt him, instead of themselves (simply sugest my chest in this confused music) but, hey, this is only my opinion and im just a 7th grader, so i dont know everything, and this is just my opinion/ theory. Hope i helped, though

@MashedPE, I also agree but I also think the rap verse is about how society doesn't help suicidal kids either. They push them around like ""mutant kids"" and show them the direction to suicide. This speaks to me as bullying or the Laramie Project, in the story of the Laramie Project a boy who is openly gay gets beaten to death by some kids at school. ""It's obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist"" see what I mean? The guns are their anger that get transformed into their hands as weapons.

@MashedPE I agree with everything you’ve said. My girlfriend struggled with with depression while I was dating her, and I didn’t know that the heck to do to help, and of course I’m not just going to ask her. This song really helped me understand, and help her through it.

@MashedPE ""When the sun sets it upsets what's left of my invested interest, interested in putting my fingers to my head"" he is more depressed at night, when the sun sets, and he loses interest with the world. His fingers are the barrel of the gun, and putting them to his head would kill him, which he is interested in doing. ""The solution is I see a whole room of these mutant kids"" When he's playing a concert, he's looking down on a whole room of depressed teens. ""Fused at the wrists"" they are holding on so tightly to the guns in their hands, a metaphor for their suicidal habits and thoughts. ""I simply tell them they should shoot at this. Simply suggest my chest and this confused music"" When he sings this lyrics he is literally telling them this. He'd rather them kill him, he'd rather it be him, or at least it's to prove the point that they would never do it to him, and should never do it to themselves. You can't shoot at the music, but it's an extension of him. It's a bit hard to explain. ""It's obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist"" to put their guns away, and to rally together in strength.

@poetslife 















i think the song could also have self mutilation references and an overall anti suicide theme

i think ""fused at the wrist"" is referring to how a lot of self mutilators will cut their wrists, and it exposes the flesh underneath. all of these people being ""connected"" through the bare flesh on their wrists. i know it sounds weird but it kinda makes sense to me lol

@herestolife1000 















I think this song is about how he knows what it feels like to be depressed or suicidal and just to take a breath a think before you do anything. 
""I know what you think in the morning,
When the sun shines on the ground,
And shows what you have done,
It shows where your mind has gone,
And you swear to your parents,
That it will never happen again,
I know, I know what that means, I know."" 
Is talking about a failed suicide attempt. The sun came up and show what you did the night before. You tell your parent it won't happen again that you're okay now. He is also saying that he knows how you feel and what you mean. 

""That you all have guns,
And you never put the safety on,
And you all have plans,
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it"" 
You don't put the safety one because you're ready to go at any moment and you have made your plans already. He is saying not to go through with those plans to take your life. 

""I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep,
But I can't, but I can't when you all have,
Guns for hands."" 
He can't sleep, he can't rest knowing that you are ready to pull the trigger. 

""Let's take this a second at a time,
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme,
Together, let's breathe,
Together, to the beat,
But there's hope out the window,
So that's where we'll go,
Let's go outside and all join hands,
But until then you'll never understand."" 
Just take a minute as step back from your problem and breath. There's hope out there and together you can go find it. You must go or you won't understand that there is hope and people out there for you. 

""We've turned our hands to guns, trade in our thumbs for ammunition,
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition,
'Cause when the sun sets, it upsets what's left of my invested interest,
Interested in putting my fingers to my head,"" 
We've stopped fighting and went for the guns instead. He mentions that he has a condition or disorder which I assume to be depression. And at the end of the day he only interest is to end it. 

""The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids,
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this,
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's,
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist.""
His solution to for all these kids with these thoughts to put down the guns and keep fighting.

This is definitely a shout out to all listeners who ever thought of/or attempted suicide, or you might even say homicide.

This band is very adamant about singing towards a crowd while trying to instill a certain sense of meaning through their lyrics.  

'I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands yeah'

In the chorus above, he's expressing his inability to sleep while he's thinking about all the kids out there that he can save through his music.  He's asking people to listen to his music, to find something else to believe in and be interested in.  A lot of his other songs promote unity through art, like Forest:

(""Down in the forest we'll sing a chorus
One that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we'll be on fire
Singing songs that nobody wrote."")

or Kitchen Sink:

(Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something, yeah it might be worthless,
Then paint something then, it might be wordless,
Pointless curses, nonsense verses,
You'll see purpose start to surface)

I do think its a bit egocentric to play to your lyrics like Tyler does.  But i think its good enough that he can do it successfully.

I have been clinically depressed, diagnosed since highschool. I like to think i overcame it.  I honestly feel very little difference now (almost 12 years later) than I did before, but i've really evolved into someone who understands the world I'm in and I've accepted it.  I have a completely different paradigm of decisions I make, and relationships I work with.  (It's difficult to maintain relationships when you're apathetic state desires complete solitude) 

Not a lot of people can do that.  Twenty One Pilots shows a pretty good understanding of that mentality, which is why I think i can connect with them.

@fr0st2k what do you mean - to play to your lyrics?			

i broke this song down verse by verse in a notebook of mine, and here's my interpretation:

i think the 1st verse is talking about the realization of who you have become and how you turned out (depressed/suicidal), and you're promising people you won't turn out like this again, even though you don't mean it. and the 2nd verse and chorus basically says that he (Tyler) knows that they're are depressed and suicidal people out there, and he's concerned and scared.

the 3rd verse, to me, is basically saying to take life slowly, take time to heal, and you don't have to do it on your own. and that we can escape from whatever is keeping us down (""out the window"") and go where there is hope, but you won't get there unless you're willing to try.

i wasn't sure on the 4th verse, but what i got from it is that we grew up and traded our happiness for depression (turned our hands to guns, thumbs for ammunition) and when Tyler mentions the sun setting and putting his fingers to his head, i think he's explaining how he gets at night: suicidal (might not be true but that's what i got from it). and he's telling all the kids who self-harm to try to create music instead and fight. yeah, i'm not sure on the 4th one.
overall, i'm sure it's an anti-suicide song.

also, i think it's titled ""Guns For Hands"" because we use our hands for everything, it's all we use. but there are people out that only use/want to use guns instead, and ""put their fingers to their heads"".

that is my opinion.

@19thpilot 















This song is about taking the drive to hurt oneself when depressed and turning it into a drive to do anything but that, whether it be to create art or music, drive towards ambitions, let your emotions out some other way. Just taking that energy and channeling it away from something you shouldn't do and towards something you should do.

""""""
I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground

""""""
I think this is when you're found after a failed suicide attempt.

As for the chorus, i believe him saying 'You have guns for hands"" means that so many people commit suicide their hands might as well be guns. And this fact makes it hard for him to sleep at night knowing all the suicidal people out there.

""""""
Let's take this a second at a time

So that's where we'll go
Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then you'll never understand
""""""
I believe this part takes place in suicide therapy. Trying to encourage people who are suicidal to rethink. Trying to calm them down.

""""""
That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it
""""""
I feel this verse is quite literal of him begging you not to kill yourself with guns. That people these days never put the safeties on and they all have plans to take their own life.


""""""
We've turned our hands to guns, trade in our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition
'Cause when the sun sets, it upsets what's left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist
""""

I believe this part also takes place in therapy. He is referring to his disorder as being suicidal. ""I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music"" We would prefer instead of having these people kill themselves, he'd prefer them to aim the gun to his chest and kill him instead.

So i believe its about a person heavily worried about committing suicide and those who are considering committing suicide. Possibly the man Tyler is singing about is a suicide therapist or he is just singing of his own concerns.

"
437,H..json,"
Okay guys, I'm pretty positive on this meaning.  This isn't my own interpretation, therefore I do not take credit for it, but I do agree with it.
  Okay, about the meaning from toolshed.down.net... it's partly true, but not completely.  Ya ever wonder why they just DO NOT play that song on tour, like hardly at all, even though it's so popular?  Well it's because this song has a special meaning to Maynard.
    Devo Keenan, his son, has the middle name of H... not anything extra... just H.  The song isn't about any person at all, it's about his son... think about the song.  Maynard had a bad relationship with his father when he was young, constantly being abused.  Even though he loves Devo, sometimes he has a problem, and wants to hurt him.  He gets it from his father... and it causes him to want to lash out at his wife and his child. that's why when he says they're ""void of hate, but killing him just the same""... he means that Devo loves him, but he's still hurting Maynard because of Maynard's past.... 
  When he talks about ""snake behind me hisses, what my damage could have been"", he's talkin about how what his father did to him wants to resurge through him and onto Devo.  then the next verse ""my blood before me begs me, open up my heart again""... he's sayin that the blood before him (his children, future grandchildren, etc.) is begging him to forget the past and start over... Infer the rest of the song for yourself.  I think this is the best explanation possible.  Thanks for botherin to read this.

			I don't think its about actually wanting to abuse his son I think its the fear that he will be like his father someday. That he is doomed to that fate because people who abuse their children were more often then not, abused themselves. Hes talking about the love he has for his son and how it has killed the person he used to be. I myself have a son and I completely understand him saying ""considerately killing me"". He has changed everything I ever was and ever thought I could be. He killed the old me and made me better, ""as I look in his eyes my fear begins to fade"". He was scared to have a child until he saw him and fell in love. He is also saying he is no longer afraid to die, he has a legacy now and no matter where he is he lives on in his child.

			DEAR TOOL FRIEND, thanks a lot for your great psychologic parenting explanation for the song H from Tool.  Well and you know this world it is full of opressive governments, abusive concentration of wealth and power in a few, and the police fascism against people. I think that the oligarchic dictatorial governments that the world has had for the last 3000 years has an impact on the family dictatorship at home of parents verbally and morally abusing their children.  So in this case parents are like the oppressive governments and the children are the working class.  However I want to say something related to this, i admit that I have had many verbal fights with my father, and my father has had sometimes an oppressive dictatorial way of treating me and my brothers and sisters. But I think that this is ingrained in the capitalist system.

I think that the only solution for this is a mental, spiritual, socialist, christian  revolution in this world(Not the Republican Party type of christianity), i mean the liberating socialist-christianity.

And many simplistic people in this world are very wrong in blaming all their personal failures in life on Obama and the capitalist ruling class.  But the dictatorial abusive parenting is also to blame. However that dictatorial way of treating children is really rooted in the capitalist oligarchic dictatorial political system we have in USA and in many many other nations.

Only a political revolution toward workers socialism can be a solution for this male-supremacist system and dictatorial system of abusive parents, abusive husbands, abusive teachers, abusive institutions etc.

thanks

Most say this song is about his son, name being Devo H. Keenan (initial only)

""Maynard"" is name James picked up at Westpoint, he was born James ""H""erbert Keenan.

He wrote this song while his girlfriend was pregnant with his child, and it is about the storm of emotion bred up inside him over conflicting feelings of perpetuating the abuse he suffered at the hands of his stepfather, and a desire to overcome these worries of ""Do unto others, what they have don to you"" (perpetuating the cycle of abuse) and raise his child with love. ""H"" is about Maynard struggling with his soon to collide past and present, and his realization in the face of it, that he can do it.

@thewhitepony33 















Like i've read here and there this song is actually about Maynard's son, whose second name is “H”. But I think that's not exactly about the fear to replicate upon his own son the violence that he himself has suffered from his father.
I think that the lyric involves directly or indirectly 4 charachters:
Maynard : who is the center of an inner conflict.
The snake : Personification of Maynard's hate, rage, and revenge feelings for what he suffered when he was a child
Maynard's father 
Maynard's son.
Keeping these in mind, all we have to do is understand sentence by sentence whom the song is referring to.

>>> “What's coming through is alive. What's holding up is a mirror.”

Maynard's son lead Maynard to look at himself and think again about his sad childhood.

>>> “But what's singing songs is a snake. Looking to turn my piss to wine.”

The snake is the temptation to indulge in hate and resentment, making them look like pleasant feelings (piss to wine).

>>> “They're both totally void of hate, But killing me just the same.”

That's referred to the snake and the father.

>>> The snake behind me hisses What my damage could have done. “

That's ambiguois. I think the “damage” could be the mark of the father on Maynard, the fact that his personality changed in worst because he became full of hate, resentment, etc.

>>> My blood before me begs me Open up my heart again.

But his inner voice (me) and his son (my blood) beg him to not let his father, the hate and resentment win, but to open his heart instead.

>>> And I feel this coming over like a storm again. Considerately.

All the fear, inner conflicts, rage, etc. that he experienced in the past as his father came to beat him are happening once again in his mind.

>>> Venomous voice, tempts me, Drains me, bleeds me. Leaves me cracked and empty. Drags me down like some sweet gravity.

As above the snake is the temptation to indulge in anger and bad feelings instead of fighting them.

>>>  I am too connected to you. To slip away, fade away. Days away I still feel you. Touching me, changing me. Considerately killing me.

That's the climax of the inner fight: Maynard is scared that the past hurted him to deeply and too much, so that's impossible for him to change, to forget.

>>> Without the skin here, Beneath the storm. Under these tears now, The walls came down. And as the snake is drowned And as I look in his eyes, My fear begins to fade Recalling all of those times. I could have cried then. I should have cried then. (…) I have died and will die. It's all right. (I don't mind)

At the end Maynard won the fight, he is reborn: all the anger that surrond him like walls are gone, the snake that tempted him is gone.  He look in his son's eyes in order to find the strenght to change and let the good feelings win. But even if he won this fight he can't erase what happened: he still recall those days, he still remember all the bad feelings he had to hide, all the time he wanted to cry, all the time that he died inside. And every time he will remember what happened he will die inside once again.

After all this song is pretty similar to “Reflection”: both describes an inner fight against bad feelings (anger and resentment / selfishness and sloth), and both ends up with the win of the good side of the soul. (“And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt. Don't wanna be down here feeding my narcissism” /  “Without the skin here, Beneath the storm. Under these tears now, The walls came down. And as the snake is drowned And as I look in his eyes, My fear begins to fade”)

			This song is about addiction itself. H. just happens to be a platform for the idea.			






			This song is about addiction itself. H. just happens to be a platform for the idea.			

This song sounds, to me, like the trials of being addicted to heroin. Of course the song is H. which is slang for heroin but put it in deeper meaning: 

""What's coming through is alive.
What's holding up is a mirror.
But what's singing songs is a snake
Looking to turn this piss to wine. ""

The snake is the needle, here to help numb my pains, a great numbing sensation this is, its turning my piss to wine.

""And I feel this coming over like a storm again.
Considerately.""

This is my withdrawals, being sucked back to the needle. As hard as I try to stay away for my own concern and the concern of my loved ones, I keep being sucked back.

Venomous voice, tempts me,
Drains me, bleeds me,
Leaves me cracked and empty.
Drags me down like some sweet gravity. 

The drug wont let me go, its destroying my life but I cant, for the life of me, get away. I need it so bad, I want to get away but it keeps calling my back.

""I am too connected to you to
Slip away, to fade away.
Days away I still feel you
Touching me, changing me,
And considerately killing me.""

I dont know life without you, now that I am clean, I dont know what to do but be depressed, this depression is killing me as bad as you were once killing me. I still want you so badly, I feel you trying to come back into my life.

""Without the skin,
Beneath the storm,
Under these tears
The walls came down.""

I am hopeless, I am weak and I am open, I cannot proceed. The walls are coming down. This is my withdrawal.

""And the snake is drowned and
As I look in his eyes,
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of those times.

I could have cried then.
I should have cried then. ""

My sweet, sweet relapse. I miss you so much. I hate the fact I am doing this, but I need it so bad, I shouldnt have done this.


This is the best part of any song I have ever experienced. I love this line so much, it is so compassionate, so deep. I listen to this song every single day and the moment this line comes on, my heart sinks:

""And as the walls come down and
As I look in your eyes
My fear begins to fade
Recalling all of the times
I have died
and will die.
It's all right.
I don't mind. ""


This is it, Im hooked again. I've already relapsed, there is no turning back now, and you know what? I really dont mind anymore. This is all I know so this is all I will stick to. I'm dead inside, I have nothing more to give, nothing more to live for but this drug.

Sincerely,
 Lafayette

I know addiction, I know the effect it holds on someone, and this song sounds to me like my own compassionate addiction which may be why I love this song with all my heart.

"
440,Hallelujah.json,"
I think when he wrote it he was having serious problems overcoming drug addiction. 

Various people have various reactions to various drugs, but I'm also pretty sure before No More Shall We Part came out he was suffering either a lack of creative inspiration or just a form of writers block as a result of either withdrawl from the drugs or a direct result of the drugs themselves (im a bit hazy about it, but there's something to do with drugs). 

To me, 
""My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all its teeth bared""
furthers this idea - he is unable to write or play due to craving, so he leaves the saftey of his home in order to find a drug dealer to help him write again. 

""There rose before me a little house
With all hope and dreams kept within
A woman`s voice close to my ear
Said, ""Why don`t you come in here?""""

He reaches the threshhold of his dealer, and is tempted to accept their offer of whatever drug. 
""All hope and dreams lay within"" surely hinting at the potential highs achievable.

However, he is aware that the ""nurse"" - presumably the side of his consciousness which wants him to overcome his addiction, or perhaps just the expectations of society - has helped him with the bad side of the drugs;

""But with her hot cocoa and her medication
My nurse had been my one salvation""

and so decides to return to the safe and secure confines of what is social normality (journeying back from a place remote in the countryside to the town: i'm guessing going to see a drug dealer isnt a highstreet affair).

The tears he cries on the way back are perhaps instilled by a sense of loss - although he is relieved to have made the choice he did (""hallelujah""), he did quite like drugs, and decides to bury the tears associated with them deep underground where they cant affect him, in a symbolic gesture. 



I dont know. I'm only 16. I cant begin to scratch the surface of the depth of nick cave's lyrics.

			I mostly agree with everyone, but most of you seem to think the nurse is good and the house is drugs, but I think it's the exact opposite.  Nurse = drugs; woman/house = love.

He stops taking drugs (give his nurse weekend off) and he can't write or exist anymore.

Then somehow this woman/house appears, a saviour of love who says she'll provide him shelter, care for him, etc.  

But in the end, he goes back to his nurse (drugs) and in the process loses the love he could've had for the crutch the nurse provides.  

So he cries.

You've pretty much got it Starfighter. It's just about leaving safety, being drawn towards temptation and eventually escaping it. Probably to do with drugs, but that's not necessary for an accurate interpretation. The 'Hallelujah' in the chorus is incredibly intriguing since it sounds so mournful, yet is a joyous word. I get the feeling that's the whole point.

Somehow I always see the nurse as a psychiatric nurse, keeping her patient doped up with (anti-psychotic?)medications; he escapes, but doesn't have the courage to break away so he has to go back. And I wonder about that ""little house"" - Cave has used this phrase before (in 'Papa Won't Leave You, Henry') to mean a brothel. Maybe the friendly young woman represents the temptations of the flesh?

@morbid morag 















This song is about leaving behind your bad habits, like drugs or alcohol abuse. First, the narrator - alone for the first time in a long time - sees what he has done: 'My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb / And my piano crouched in the corner of my room / With all its teeth bared'.

Then he went for a walk, where he meets old temptations, the 'house' and the 'woman' - which are maybe a pub or something, where he met his old 'friends'. They are very tempting ('Now, you might think it wise to risk it all / Throw caution to the reckless wind'), but he thinks of someone he loves, the nurse, who had saved him ('But with her hot cocoa and her medication / My nurse had been my one salvation'). He knows he would dissapoint her when he falls back into his old habbits, so he turned home.

Then he cries because he knows he has vanquished his habits, which had to 'buried' with a lot of trouble.

@UUTR 















I really love these lines:
""And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all its teeth bared""

And the ending is so moving: 

""The tears are welling in my eyes again
Hallelujah
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in
Hallelujah
And twenty pretty girls to carry
them down
Hallelujah
And twenty deep holes to bury them in""

It seems to be about trying to escape from a repressing comfort zone. He's trying to venture out in the world and live life, and he sees the house ""with all hope and dreams kept within"". But in the end he is too scared to enter. So he turns back home to his protected life and continues to suppress all his emotions. The image of his tears that as to be carried in twenty big buckets and buried in twenty deep holes is so strong. 
I think it could be interpreted as religion being the ""nurse"" protecting people from reality, and keeping them from truly living life. 
In dream analysis a house is usually seen as a symbol of a persons identity, so it could be that the narrator is actually tempted, but afraid of looking inwards.

Just recently, it came to me that a nurse might be his wife who went away. So he, being alone and sad, wanted to cheat on her, but he couldn't. That would fit the idea of ""a little house"" being a brothel anyway:)

It sounds like it's about a woman who is trying to resist temptation to sin because she's been raised on the fact that sex is evil by her conservative parents when she is out on the town.

This song paints a beautiful portrait about the pain of letting go and the sacrifices that we make for love. I am torn about the video, mostly because I have lost my own dog in the past, and reliving that pain is rough. However, the video has such beautiful imagery, that it was overall wonderful to watch. The video features a young girl (played by Miranda Cosgrove when the girl becomes a teenager) who, in the midst of feeling left out and abandoned by her friends, receives a puppy for her birthday. The dog makes her happier throughout her lifetime, but in the end, she needs to learn to be happy on her own. Her dog passes and she grows up to have her own daughter, who receives her own puppy for her birthday, and the cycle begins anew. The lyrics deal with reassessing relationships and making sure that they are still healthy for us and others before proceeding. The song and the video both recognize that while letting go is hard, it's a natural part of life, and once we get rid of things that no longer serve us, we can grow to be better than before.

This is the MOST CLEVER pop song ever and you're all wrong on its meaning.  The song is about a woman who learns her man is cheating on her and decides to shoot him (Happiness is getting revenge on your cheating husband by shooting him).  The song begins: ""She’s not a girl who misses much. 
Do do do do do do do do 
She’s well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand 
Like a lizard on a window pane.""  She's observant and when someone tries to conceal something she notices (You would wear velvet gloves to prevent stains and therefore prevent someone from detecting you).  The next lines follow: Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy 
Working overtime 
A soap impression of his wife which he ate 
And donated to the National Trust. 
Lying with your eyes indicates infidelity while his eyes desperately try to conceal the truth, the soap impression means that he didn't have high regard for his wifes intelligence, he figured he could commit sexual infidelity and she'd never notice because she trusts him too much.  Mother Superior jump the gun simply means Mother Superior (a nickname for the lady) pulled the trigger and shot him.  Then comes the brilliant twist, happiness is getting back at the unfaithful man.

			lol you people are crazy. i dont know where you get these interpretations from.
do some reading and you'll realize most of you are wrong.
first of all, its john lennon's vocals through the whole song. paul and george only provide backup and its john screaming not paul.
second of all the title of the song came from a magazine cover john lennon saw
the first part of the song (""she's well acquainted..."") is something john wrote from what he saw on an acid trip
the second part (""i need a fix..."") is a reference to his heroin addiction
and the rest of the song is too debatable to interpret because it could be a continuation of his drug addiction or its a reference to his sex life with yoko ono.

			dayday469 your crazy.
You do realize songs can have more than one interpretation, right?
That's what makes music music, it hold different sentimental value for everyone.

Besides, DirtyDan has much more logical and clear thinking than you.
""The first part is cuz John Lennon is an acid addict, and the second part refers back to it.""
That could be true, but i still hold that its either about a wife being cheated on and getting back at her husband [makes the most sense at the moment] or suicide.
And now that I think about it, there's really no way it can be suicide.

Why do you have to be such a dick about their opinion?
That ""shit"" dirty dan ""made up"" is really good, and he provides a solid basis for each part.
You just state the obvious with no real analysis except John Lennon is a druggie.
Besides, even if you were right, I'm pretty sure John Lennon would not sit there shaking his head and saying ""nope nope nope, uh-uh, your totally wrong"" if you told him this.
He might be all like, ""thats not what i was getting at, but i totally see where your coming from"" or something, but not a fucking dick like you are.

			""Mother Superior Jump the Gun"" is a multi-layered reference literally about a nun having intercourse prior to her death (and not just any nun, the leader of the convent), when she will (according to Catholicism) ultimately be (re)-united with her groom, Jesus. (Nuns wear a wedding ring on their right hand indicating they are ""married to Jesus""); however, this is very likely a shot at organized religion by John.In addition, it also talks of her ultimate fate, which is suicide because of her earthly seduction by someone who doesn't love here.

She's not a girl who misses much: again, when taken in this context, she doesn't miss much, but not in the observational sense; in the experiential sense; not the normal things a nun should miss such as carnal knowledge and human love, although it also, based on the line: ""Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime.,"" is irony insofar as she could not tell that he was not truly in love with her and he seduced her and threw her away for sexual gratification only, at first with his eyes and and and with his soft caress.

""A soap impression of his wife"" - soap implies cleanliness, so he lied to her about his wife or marriage or cleaned the picture up in someway (perhaps telling her she is dead., or he cleaned it up in some way as to make it more palatable,) ""which he ate"" --why do we eat soap or have our mouths washed out with soap? For lying of course. ""And donated to the national trust."" - he used this piece of information to win her over or to manipulate her, national in this sense meaning more universal or far-reaching.

""I need a fix cause I'm going down, down to the bits that I left uptown""- this is literally a heroin reference to coming down, but here it means a sexual fix: he is going back to the broken woman he left ""uptown""-- this word is important and is one of the key reasons that this is not a drug reference: If he meant heroin, he would have said ""downtown"", a euphemism for heroin (just as 'uptown' is a cocaine euphemism) but he is talking about the bits or shell of the woman he had this relationship, uptown implying class or somewhere of importance.

""Happiness is a warm gun, bang bang, shoot shoot,"" the nun ultimately commits suicide because she violates her vows and betrays Jesus, after she commits murder: she kills him. [There is a slight reference to Dante here insofar as she is already damned to Judecca, the 9th Circle, 4th Round  of Hell (Canto XXIV)  in Dante's Inferno (Part III of ""The Divine Comedy."" The 9th Circle is reserved for Betrayers, but special betrayer's and the 4th Round in particular is for those who have betrayed God; it is reserved for the Biblical giants lie Judas & Satan as well as the assassins of Caesar, Claudius and Brutus (because Dante thought they betrayed Italy and the World by killing the Divinely Appointed unifier of Italy.)] Since she will already be damned for betraying Jesus, she will receive no additional punishment by killing her betrayer (whom she betrays by taking his life), and killing herself. 

""When I feel my finger on your trigger, I know nobody can do me no harm"" This is irony as she believes no human can do her any more harm or even God because of her damnation. The warm reference in ""warm gun"", in addition to denoting that she fired the weapon, also is an ironic Dante reference because in the 9th Circle, you are frozen in ice and not burned by fire, up to a level commensurate with your crimes.

			Also, ""She's well acquainted with the touch of a velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane"" - this is a masturbation reference not an LSD reference. Her desires for love and carnal pleasure have often lead to masturbation. ""The man in the crowd with the multi-colored mirrors on his hob-nail boots"" Hob-nail boots imply that he was working class, used for traction so the he doesn't fall off and reveal his true self to her; the mirrors have several meanings: one, the obvious one, is that he is a pervert, peaking under dresses using mirrors on his boots, but below that level is that of her vision of herself as she looks down, constantly reflecting back at her the betrayal she is about to commit. He is also covering his working class boots with the reflection or the fantasy of what he wants her to believe, but she is a willing participant, ready to believe him. 


 ****Note that all interpretations of this song are valid except  one and that is John Lennon's own.  If you study the literary criticism of the 2oth  Century beginning with Ezra Pound, John Crowe Ransom, James Joyce and TS Elliott, you realize we are in the century of Relativity; whatever meaning a song has to you is a valid interpretation [It is the meaning a song has (to you)]. The reason the author is excepted from interpretation is because of another  artifact of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics (i.e,,modern physics) references, and that is related to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In physics, this means that we cannot exactly  know both momentum (velocity, { that is {times mass}) and location X  at the same time. [Î”X Ã— âˆ†P â‰® hâ„2Ï€ ]. When we know one exactly, we must sacrifice our knowledge of the other such that the product of the uncertainty of the two measurements is greater than Plank's Constant divided by 2Ï€ ; or, in terms of  Energy and Time [ Î”E Ã— âˆ†T  â‰® hâ„2Ï€]. 

When using this in terms of literary criticism, the person creating the work has too much psychological baggage to interpret his or her own work. In other words, you cannot step outside of yourself and see what you look like to other people. A good example of this occuring to me personally where I began to really understand the significance, was when I was reading over some poetry from a college poetry magazine I had been involved with in the early 1990's, The pages were typed so I could not recognize the handwriting. I read two peoms that I was blown away by and I was trying to determine which of the people involved in the magazine had written the poems. I suddenly realized they were my own work; immediately, I no longer was able to see anything special about the poems, and I began picking them apart line by line. I have always been very critical of my own writing and I cannot look at it from an unbiased veiw. No  matter how many people tell me how much they like it or how impressed theey are, it is hard for me to get beyond the phase of self-doubt.       MD******

			MobiusDick, you are a badass. Thank you for setting everything straight. Though I don't necessarily take your interpretation of this song as my own, I can totally see where you're coming from. Furthermore, I respect your clearly deep knowledge of literary theory and it only lends credibility to your opinions on this board. But I have to admit, I hate the idea that an artist's interpretation of his own work is the only one that is non-valid, or at least, the least valid (though you are correct that it is one of the tenets of the age of Relativity). I'm a fiction writer and I know what my own interpretation of my work is, but I don't eliminate the possibility that anyone else's opinion is as worthwhile as my own. We all bring our own baggage to a work, including the artist.

@DirtyDan I thought this was obvious... what a bunch of strange interpretations to a very straight forward song.  Although she may have been on drugs when she sought revenge.

A few things I wonder about though, why is her nickname ""Mother Superior"" and why did he eat a ""soap"" figure of his wife?  And who is this ""Man in the crowd with the multicolored glasses and the hobnail boots""?  Reference to LSD?  This may be the drug she was on when she took her revenge.

Also I think the reference to, 'when I hold you in my arms"" may be her new lover who knows about the justice she implemented on her previous husband and is happy to hear he has a woman who is protective and capable.

Either way you look at it, it is a known fact that ""happiness IS a warm gun oh yeah""  sorry Pierce Morgan, you are an utter moron :)

Either way you look at it, it is a known fact that ""happiness IS a warm gun oh yeah""  sorry Pierce Morgan, you are an utter moron :)			

I believe this song is about heroin addiction. ""she’s not a girl who misses much."" describes the attitude of a heroin user who is relatively content with her new lifestyle. ""She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand"" is saying she is familiar with the high heroin produces, comparing the calming feel of the drug with being rubbed by a velvet hand. ""like a lizard on a window pane"" If you think about what is taking place when a lizard is on a window pane it is not hard to connect it again with opiates. Just think of an animal blocked from the natural world by a window, the outside world is visible but the animal (or heroin user) is disconnected to it. ""the man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors on his hobnail boots."" describes a person who could possibly go undetected amongst a crowd but upon closer inspect would obviously be considered odd, someone who is different, a heroin addict. ""lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime"" says that this addict is trying to conceal his drug habits while he is busy pursuing them. ""a soap impression of his wife which ate and donate to the National Trust"" refers to the corruption of his once clean lover who he consumed (turned her into an addict) and changed into something disgusting (turn her into trash and flushed her down the toilet: donating to the National trust) ""I need a fix cause I'm going down, down to the bits I left uptown. I need a fix cause I'm going down"" is saying: I need to use heroin because I'm coming down, and going through withdrawals, the lack of drugs is ripping him apart, and the uptown reference could be referring to a particular spot in which drugs are purchased, saying, I need some more heroin because I'm hurting from withdrawals, so I need to go uptown, the place I always go to get heroin. The next set of lyrics uses “gun” to represent a needle. ""Mother superior's jump the gun"" is talking about a woman preparing a shot of heroin. 

""happiness is a warm gun"" A needle+Heroin(which is usually heated prior to use) = happiness. The next line could be about a heroin addict singing to the needle ""when I hold you in my arms"" can be interpreted as when I've got the needle in my arm, ""and I feel my finger on your trigger"" and I feel my finger on the plunger (the part of the needle you need to push to inject the heroin) ""I know nobody can do me no harm because happiness is a warm gun"" the drug user knows that he's about to get high and therefore won't care about anybody or anything else. “Bang, Bang shoot, shoot” are slang terms for shooting heroin.  

And of course this is just my opinion, so, obviously it’s 100% accurate and everyone else is totally wrong….

According to Lennon, the title came from the cover of a gun magazine that producer George Martin showed him: ""I think he showed me a cover of a magazine that said 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun.' It was a gun magazine. I just thought it was a fantastic, insane thing to say. A warm gun means you just shot something.""[1] The reference, whether or not intermediately from the magazine, was one of many 1960s riffs on Charles M. Schulz's culturally popular saying, Happiness is a Warm Puppy, which began in the Peanuts comic strip and became a widely sold book.

"
446,Happy Hour.json,nil
447,Harvester Of Sorrow.json,"
This song is definitely about a parent who tries to escape their misery through drugs and alcohol and eventually takes it out on his family by beating and killing them. Here is my interpretation of the lyrics for each of the 3 verses in the song:

Verse 1:
My Life Suffocates
Planting Seeds of Hate
I've Loved, Turned to Hate
Trapped Far Beyond My Fate

I Give
You Take
This Life That I Forsake
Been Cheated of My Youth
You Turned this Lie to Truth

-- This is giving a historical view of the Harvester of Sorrows' life. It explains how he became the Harvester of Sorrow. It's pretty straight forward, no need to go into detail here.


2nd Verse:
Pure Black Looking Clear
My Work Is Done Soon Here
Try Getting Back to Me
Get Back Which Used to Be

Drink up
Shoot in
Let the Beatings Begin
Distributor of Pain
Your Loss Becomes My Gain

-- This verse explains how he thinks about himself and how the Harvester of Sorrow deals with it. He attempts to ""get back which used to be"" by abusing drugs and alcohol. Which results in him becoming violent. At this point it does not indicate that he is violent towards his family. The Harvester of Sorrow could just be getting in fights at bars or places he gets drunk and high at (like when people get drunk at bars and start fights ... get it?). Essentially, he gets drunk/high and takes his anger out on others.

3rd Verse:
All Have Said Their Prayers
Invade Their Nightmares
See into My Eyes
You'll Find Where Murder Lies

Infanticide

-- This is the verse that indicates that the Harvester of Sorrow has finally snapped and beats and murders his children (indicated by infanticide ... which has nothing to do with abortion BTW). He has finally become the Harvester of Sorrow.

			Just wanted to add that this basically describes the evolution of an abusive person, in this case to the extreme where that individual kills their children. It is NOT about abortion, or the personification of addiction, and definitely not about slaver. It's very straightforward and not very abstract.

I've always inferred that this song was about someone who's suffered horribly and perceives themselves as being wronged and even persecuted on all sides.  As a result, they become bitter, unable to feel compassion for other humans, and lash out angrily and even violently.  This resembles certain schizophrenia-type mental disorders (note: scizophrenia =/= multiple personality disorder), where the sufferer becomes paranoid and perceives themselves as being persecuted on all sides.  The song's lyrics and its emphasis on violence, alienation, and emotional blunting best matches the development of clinical psychopathy.

			Id you hold on to the anger, misery, you'll suffer. And you'll keep on suffering until you let it go. Hence, you become the Harvester of Sorrow.			






			Id you hold on to the anger, misery, you'll suffer. And you'll keep on suffering until you let it go. Hence, you become the Harvester of Sorrow.			

I'm thinking this is either a generalized Grim Reaper/Final Judgement song like Metallica is so fond of, or a bloody-justice teenage revenge anthem. I'm leaning towards the latter. Why you ask? I'll explain.

The song clearly indicates a strong feeling of victimhood and unjustified abuse. A person of formerly pure intentions (""Planting Seeds of Hate, I've Loved, Turned to Hate, Trapped Far Beyond My Fate"") has been driven into vengeful bloodlust by a lifetime of mistreatment (""I Give, You Take, This Life That I Forsake, Been Cheated of My Youth, You Turned this Lie to Truth). 

The person in question is now motivated only by pure rage and pain (""Anger, Misery, You will Suffer unto Me"", Distributor of Pain, Your Loss becomes my gain"" etc.) and he proceeds to exact bloody payment (""All Have Said Their Prayers, Invade Their Nightmares, See into My Eyes, You'll Find Where Murder Lies) on those who planted the seeds of hate in his heart, pushed him beyond his normal limits of morality, took from him when he did nothing but give to them, and robbed him of his innocence. 

He has become the Harvester of Sorrow.

So basically, take your average school shooter's life story and make a song out of it, and this is what you get.

@Bullzeye 















just listen in sorrow and awe to the skill of the drummer in the first 1.17 minutes.. this song is really a chellenge for any respectable drummer and Lars seems to to give the best of himself here... It is a song dominated by anger, frustration and sorrow. The heavy guitar riff and the Bass drum rolls confirm this... i believe that if you take away the lyrics from this piece, the song will loose none of its prowess, and will still express the true pain and feeeling put in the treated subject.... Lars rules, and though technically he may not be at the skill of such drummers as Mike Portnoy, or Danny Carey, he is still my favorite drummer cause he has the ability of transmitting all his wrath and passion through his pounding... He knows music is expression of feeling and soul...
Thanks for reading my humble opinion

OK, why hasnt anyone ever brought up what happend during WWII? The Harvest of Sorrows, it was when the russians when to a city where their were a bunch of farms, they made the people harvest their crops and give it to them. for years the russians came back and took all their crops, causing the people living there to die of starvation. ""Planting seeds of hate"". Obviosly these farmers who were planting the crops knew where they were going to, so they hated planting them becuase they knew the russians were gunna take it. ""I give, You take"" this explains that the people gave little crops at first, then the russians got greedy a took it all, this isnt a song about

			reapers or a guy in a bar or even james hetfield himself. 			

			this sounds reasonable too much more reasonable than others...			

JoeMaster bullseyed it; thats the original meaning intended by the composer(s). Very straight forward.

Never the less, I like to think that beyond that straight forward meaning there's also an obscurant or faithfull one. It's a general complaint from a man directly to God himself - (sort of like a angry prayer if you wish), about how the poor evolution of his life (""My life suffocates, Planting seeds of Hate""; ""I love, turned to hate""; ""you turned this lie to truth""; ""I give, you take, this life that I forsake""), turned into a present state of total frustration, considering facts and indicators that could initially point in his favor (youth, innocence, inconditional love torwads life and people). 

With ""Anger, Misery, You'll Suffer unto Me"", God responds to him in his particular, intangible and superior way, like a true and all mighty master submits servants, by telling them that in order to reach his symphaty (and whatever that can lead to), he must first suffer to gain His trust...you know, to be reliable. To me, ""You'll Suffer unto Me"" is a too strong verse to refer simply to bad parent towards his child, or to any sort of ""booze itself"" torwads any drunk. But it fits nicelly if u think it's God. With ""your loss becomes my gain"", eventually the guy compreends that God knows that all his sacrifice will obvisously mean little or nothing to him in his mortal, short and pathetic life, but will certainly favour Him, in a misterious and much superior way.

The complainging comes from a man who has a life not even close to what he once expected it to be, or thinks or thought he deserved - this based in a self-judgement he makes of his once young self - a pure, innocent and highly energized and life-loving child - ""I loved, turned to hate"". The self judment is also implied in ""been cheated of my youth"" and ""trapped far beyond my fate"". It all helps building the obvious frustration. The background can be only one: poor, if not horrible, but at least neglectful - parenting.

In the end, he's feels so miserably torwards life, he senses he's got nothing else to give or fight for, thus leading him to start feeling he's closed to dying, or at least he can no longer feel that life welcomes him, but instead its death he senses coming closer (Pure Black Looking Clear, My Work Is Done Soon Here). At this point, God then tries to encourage him by a very tricky and dubious verse: ""Try Getting Back to Me; Get Back Which Used to Be"". This could mean God wants him to love life again, like he did in his young age, by whatever ""good means"" necessary.

In the end, the man remembers times he thought of murdering ppl as a way of ending great sources of the suffering (this could've come in momments of getting bullied, for instance, as many bullied children actually think or even dream of assassinating their agressors).

I believe this song is about depression and how it can take the toll of an individual to a deep, dark path, eventually into drugs, booze, then to murder.  Depression is evil personified.  Evil is the harvester of their sorrows.

This song can have two meanings. Listed above is one. Think about this one:
the song talks about abortion. The lyrics support this idea also.
 ""My life suffocates"" -embryo being killed
 ""Planting the seeds of hate"" -abortion pill or unwanted sperm
 ""Been cheated of my youth"" -can't live out childhood
 ""You turn the lies to truth"" -mother makes reality of abortion

Written by JB for his friends T&L Ewing. Historical account about Charles Hatfield and his brother hired by the Wide Awake Society of San Diego to bring water to the town in a drought. 

This song also is about a big fat German lady who gets drunk, plays all sorts of different blues on all sorts of differently stranged banjos. She also lures the children to her home like scylla and charibdes with pies and booze...her daughter also helps in this corruption of children by going around the neighborhood with a 6 pack of assorted beers:Usually Pabst Blue Ribbons and Gennie Cream Ales.

The Hatfield family is currently under investigation for running a child pornography ring.

It's a long story but,it was in the early 90""sometime when George Bush was in office the father,people were smuggling merchandise clothes,shoes,people and a little drugs from Havana over to GA,there was no east GA at that time so people thought that was funny,so anyway the girl really was from Havana she was basically kidnapped and she was with a young black man from ATL running the smuggling merchandise back and forth she was beautiful,so beautiful she couldn't get away from the young black man because people would always tell him where she was and she tried to get away but it didn't happen,but anyways the young black man was younger and not very smart good looking tho,and really only wanted a better way of life,he was a little slow he wasn't a good driver and in the early 90""there wasn't many GPS and if there was they the smuggler and the young black man didn't have GPS.so they were carrying big deal items Versace Nike Levi designer dresses made by seamstress in The Havana Etc,,to make a long story short the beautiful young woman had to kill the young black man to get rid of him because he would not leave her alone..they say her had to cut his heart out of his chest and nobody in Havana would help her or in ATL she was on her own. She was an immigrant so she didn't know everything,but the young black man needed her to rid with him because she helped point the way a little bit on the highway with directions and he had to bring her because she was beautiful on the highway and plus she could speak another language little bit.so they would tell people they were looking for a place to live or moving stuff like that that's why they there on the highway sometimes truck sometimes old cars..but anyways the song is to be played big and scary like I'm dead I left my Heart in Havana played with a huge mariachi band and drums and horns and everything kind of like the Dawn of the Dead kind of Celebration and the girl in this video that sings the song really looks like the woman a lot and the guy did a perfect job with the rap solo but that's the basic story and it's even better than that that's just a little synopsis of what the song is really about and it kind of went down and folklore history because they use that type of people in situation all the time it is really an important song and is not making fun of that John ra of music as serious as really beautiful and sometimes when I hear it I sad..and no she didn't make much longer after she had to kill him to get away from him..cause the smuggler people still wanted her to work..and no they there no from where I was from but some other people followed in they footsteps and I had seen those people around and that's how we all found out the facts..so it's not a sweet fairly love song it's real life song ..about a beautiful spirit..when it's played with a live band you can still feel them..I'm only telling the shortest version few details about the young black man and she tried to love him but he just didn't know or understand how to treat her right it's a rough life circumstances.

"
451,Haven't Met You Yet.json,"
Simple meaning really, it's about a guy who's had their heart broken many times and finds it hard to trust anyone now in case he's let down again,
""I've broken my heart so many times"" and ""I get all worked up, Then I let myself down""

But one day he's met a girl or seen one (love at first sight?) and can't help but like her and tried to talk himself out of it.
""I tried so very hard not to lose it, I came up with a million excuses""

He hasn't given up on love entirely but he's still finding it hard to trust someone, and he needs the girl to work hard to prove she loves him to bring him out of his shell, so they can work on their relationship, and once he does trust her fully then he gives more then he gets, he just needs to get to know her better.
""And I know someday that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet""

And the rest of the song is just talking about how he's sure someone's gonna change him.

This is do damn true - I was making so many excuses and I was doubting things and now I think I'm just loosing the most beautiful thing that has happened to me.... :(

"
452,Head Over Boots.json,nil
453,Hear Me.json,"
This is how I see it: The character in the song is so deeply neglected that he’s desperate for a sign that someone cares.

“Try to hear my voice
You can leave, now it's your choice”
(He can’t make the person care for him…)

“Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back”
(But he wants to see them care, so he tests them with extremities.)

“Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?”
(He really wants a reaction to his suffering, but the things that bother him mean nothing to them.)

“You've got a history list and the rest is above
And if you're warm then you can't relate to me""
…
""You've got to love and adore and the rest is a lie
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me”
(Warmth is often associate with love and comfort. If you’re loved, then you can’t relate to him.)

“Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away”
(This is what he wishes for deep down; for someone to love him enough to drop everything to be with him.)

@slyke 















It describes Hypnagogia:
Hypnagogia occurs either when you are stressed (as the singer is, emotionally ""I've got a lot that's on my mind"") or simply uncomfortable, while falling asleep, and your body falls asleep faster than your mind. You can't move your body and it feels like you can't breathe (""Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right"") or like something is sitting on your chest. These sensations might cause the person to think that they are screaming, which they aren't. (""Can nobody hear me""). This component of Hypnagogia is called sleep paralysis. Often in Hypnagogia, people hear sounds, either crashing and explosions, sentences that sum up their current state of mind, their name being called, if there is any sound in the room in which they are falling asleep, they would hear that  (""Can you hear it, too?"")

I luv this song too but sleep is just the analogy for not being able to achieve what the singers deems as love because the other person that they're involved with is a not capable, they are emotionally unavailable and refuse to hear, they may even act like they don't care or intentionally toy with the singers heart and the singer is caught between what they feel for the person and their idea of a relationship and the hard realities of this circumstance, when they say they can't breathe or sleep that line represents the lack of normalcy or peace in the relationship..Isn't love like sleep or air? Something us humans can't live without.

The song is about a guy trying desperately to get a reaction out of his lover. He's depressed, stressed, anxious, and overall in a lot of emotional pain (""I've got a lot that's on my mind, I cannot breathe""). His lover won't listen to him, instead treating the relationship as one of the many fleeting ones she's had (""You kiss and you kiss and you love and you love, you've got a history list..."") (""Love is a game to you...""). He threatens suicide to try and make her pay attention to him (""Maybe if I fall asleep I won't breathe right, maybe if I leave tonight I won't come back""). The singer is frustrated and wonders if his suffering is all in his head (""Can you hear it too?"") because nobody will listen to him (""Can nobody hear me?""). In the end, he gives up and tries to escape his pain by dismissing it like his lover (""Leave your shoes at the door, baby...come with me and we will run away""). 
Sad song. Dan Reynolds has struggled with depression and anxiety and it's likely that inspired this song.

I was under the impression that the guy was irritated with the girl for not loving him or maybe not understanding him. I'd had this fear that the day I didn't tell someone I loved them would be my last day, and they'd never know I loved them. That was sort of the feeling I got here, like he has the same fear and she doesn't understand that. Or, quite possibly, she just doesn't appreciate him and he's trying to tell her he could be gone any day. The part about ""Can nobody hear me?"" may be about no one hearing him out. Simply my thoughts.

I've heard Tyler's pastor speak. This is his philosophy and the philosophy of most modern non-denominational churches these days. Those of us who are Christians should be part of the non-Christian world. We aren't great at accepting ""heathens"" into our midst, but we absolutely need to accept them AND LOVE THEM WHERE THEY ARE, HOW THEY ARE, WHO THEY ARE. Engage with the culture. Love them. Love people in trouble, people in prison, people in need. Don't preach. Just build relationships with them. Don't jump immediately into sharing your faith - take it slowly and get to know them first. You don't know how they may have been abused by so-called Christians in the past. And be sincere in your love for them - if you're just there trying to convert them, they'll smell your intentions. Wait for them to ask YOU about who you know (Jesus). By then, you will be a trusted friend and you can share the story of the love and grace you have received. And whether or not they convert doesn't matter - that's not your job - your job is to just share the love you have received with the rest of the world, share your faith if the opportunity arises, and let God do the rest.

@Moonbeam86 I want to thank you for all of your interpretations of both this song and others by Twenty One Pilots - they really help me appreciate the music better.

@Moonbeam86 I should also add that I THINK the room of people is referring to a church - he's talking about a bunch of not-sure, busted up, confused people sitting together in a church sanctuary -- many of them ""heathens"" -- singing to the sky. We check our guns at the door of the church (smile at each other and be nice because God says to) but it doesn't mean we're healthy inside our brains (hand grenades). And it's within this church that we don't deal with outsiders very well, and we can tell the newcomers, etc., etc. And then what I said above also applies.

But I do agree with others that it could also apply to Tyler and Josh's ""clique"" concept and the idea of people who come to a concert to see them. I know most people who first started listening to this band in Columbus, Ohio, were teenage Christians -- technically, we started the Clique and now people worldwide are joining us, which brings both concepts together, in a way. Christians and Clique united, all singing to the sky, looking for something more powerful than ourselves. Kind of cool, if you think about it.

@Moonbeam86 Funny how this is the only correct explanation on this site.  I kind of love the fact that the song is ""covert"" otherwise it probably wouldn't get played on the radio like it has and does!  More on Tyler Joseph (the song writer) here: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…

@Moonbeam86 I love your explanation! I am a bit confused by the last couple of sentences though. What do you reckon they mean by that? I mean, as a Christian you'd _want_ others to eventually start believing in Jesus too, right? Even if you (rightfully so) don't want to force it on them.

@AleimonThimble I was wondering about that too. I think that, if you can take the video as representing the true meaning of the song (and I assume you can - this band wouldn't do videos without really thinking it through), then the line appears to be directed at Tyler himself. You know, self-talk. At the end of the video, because Tyler dwelled among ""heathens,"" he ended up back in bondage. He became ""one of us,"" far from God. See...I think the whole song is Tyler talking to himself along with everyone else. He's telling himself ""take it slow."" But at the end, his fears of growing far from God are being voiced — his fear that he's not changing other people, but they're changing him instead. He's afraid that, while he thought he was getting other people/heathens out of bondage with his music (as represented in the video), he was really just getting sucked back into bondage himself. At least that's what the video portrays. So he ""shouldn't have come"" into this life of being surrounded by heathens, and now it looks like he's one of us. I don't know - it's a theory based mostly on the video.

@Heathen Bitch lolololololololololololololololololololololololololol *hides* 


I'm not completely sure if this is what it means but here we go.

Heathens means a couple things, unreligious or/and uncivilized.

I'm assumeing this song is referring Uncivilized. 

I believe this song is refferring to people who are recovering for war/ have fought in a war and just returned ( I'm not 100% though) 

First off a lot of people who return from war can have some mental issues, flashbacks or night terrors. 

That could explain the ""please don't make any sudden moves, you don't know their half of their abuse"" 
It could be reffering to that.

""Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people that they loved one day, docked away""

Maybe it's actually a therapy session or something like that, the people who have lost many friends that they made in the military in war.. Like I said, I'm still kind of sceptical about this theory

""Your loving on the phsycopath sitting next to you,
Your loving on the murderer sitting next to you"" 

Like I mentioned before, this might be referring to people who have mental issues from killing people in war""

""Just because we check for guns at the door, doesn't mean our brains will change for hand granades"" 

Also could be mental issues from war

It would also explain other things mentioned in the song (trust issues, being skittish, etc.)

I'm a bit sceptical on this theory but whatever

I think the song is referring to the clique (twenty one pilots fans) and the new people in it and telling them to be careful as the clique doesn't handle newcomers or outsiders (heathens) very well.  I think Tyler is also talking about the fans who only know stressed out or ride when he says ""wait for them to ask you who you know"".
When the voice in between parts of the song says ""watch it"" hes telling the new fans to watch their back.
At the end of the song he says ""I tried to warn you just to stay away"" hes referring to the song and hes warned you about the fan base and now ""it looks like you might be one of us"" one of us being the Skeleton Clique.

@from sean1 















Personally I think it's a story, the singer is the narrator and is telling you about what's going to happen next before it happens but at the same time says ""take it slow"" as if all knowing and don't worry about it, almost in a relaxed manner and in the end it says ""looks like you might be one of us"" as a you have come this far and you so tangled up in it even though they where warned not to get involved and in the end the person is no better than the murders and psychopaths and there's no turning back to being a normal person.And in the end your like everyone else, doing what ever it takes to keep the people you care about safe even if it means sitting next to a strange person that could change your life forever ether in a good way or a bad.

but also the part where they say 

""Well the empty disappears I remember why I'm here. Just surrender and believe, I fall down on my knees. Well hello world, hello world, hello world.""

I believe is like in the first verse when he's says he sees a girl with chocolate on her face and she's smiling and waving at him. He things of the beauty of a child and thinks, ""I see a light, a little hope, in a little girl. Hello World.""

Then he talks about going to church and he describes how a church gots all those crosses. Then he talks about going in an just pray a little bit and talk to God. Because when you're in church that's Gods home and you can go in when you feel like you need to let certain things out of your chest. ""I see a light, a little grace, a little faith unfurls. Hello world.""

Then finally he saying sometimes he forgets what life is all about. Then he looks at his wife and children and again thinks. Well hello world.

So it pretty much says don't take certain thing for granted and be thankful that you got faith in God, believe that there are miracles in this world, and don't forget about the beauty that this world has.

It is someone depressed and questioning existence -- both his and God's.  He is slowly dealing with depression. It is the depression healing process for those lucky enough not to need medicine or once meds take effect.  First you realize hiding in your head from all the really heinous noise also blocks out little moments of beauty and meaning that happen in life all the time (a pure innocent noticing you and feeling joy). When you can finally see past your pain, then you have to determine if there is a bigger meaning.  He thinks about stopping church and talking to God like He's there.  Then as he thinks about it, he repeats it twice more until he's asserting it.  Finally he reaches home, his responsibilities -- but the beautiful ones.  The reasons he's going to keep going and tomorrow will be better.  That's what I get from it.

i just checked out ""helter skelter"" and i didn´t like, what i read, so i decided to sign up and place a comment to put things right...

now read -  all who are interested in how this song is related to the manson family:

it is not true, that the beatles got inspiered by the murders - FACT!!!

charles manson believed that the beatles were sending him messages through their songs. he saw a race-war coming up between blacks and whites - of which he preached to his disciples, the so called ""manson family"".
he gave this war the name ""helter-skelter"" named after the song.
in the song he heard machineguns and pigs. when he realized, that his ""helter-skelter-war"" wouldn´t start, he decided to start it by himself. he went out with the family to commit the murders. the murderers stole a wallet in the polanski´s house and it was dropped in a toilet in a petrol-station in a ""black area"". then - so he thought -the war would start. he believed, that the blacks would win the war and kill all the white population. he and his family would escape and hide under the earth surface in the ""bottomless pit"" (described in the bible) which he saw located in death valley. after a long period of time the children of the family would arise out of the bottomless pit, kill all the blacks and then rule the world.

there is a lot more to this story but this version is enough for you to know. 

all the beatles wanted to do with this song is to outrock pete townsend - THAT´S ALL

peace!!!!!!, fnord

			Actually, he didn't plan to kill the blacks. After the war was over, he felt the blacks wouldn't know how to lead or run the country. He said that ""darkie"" would come to him and ask him to lead and he would pat ""darkie"" on the head and tell him to go work in the fields like a good n****er. Hia plan was to make the blacks slaves again.

			dude that whole outline of the manson murders was completely wrong! first of all charles manson never went out and did the actual killing himself secondly he thought black people would take over and he would rise up on them after the race war was over thirdly he only ordered the murders on the tate's because he wanted to kill this record producer that didnt like his music and had rejected him a record contract it just happen to b shitty luck that he had moved out and roman and sharron moved in after they killed sharron and all the guests there then they made it all look like black people had done it calling the race war 'helter skelter' then he just sent them to kill randomly which didnt get them very far because they got caught shortly after. I guess thats what lsd and baby eatin' getcha a lifetime in prison dun dun DUN.

			ok point taken but...what the person was basically saying was manson was inspired by the white album in many ways. that is the point... not the beatles by manson. manson thought of the white album like a f*in bible. and that is a FACT. the song its self is about what this person said ... paul thought .... we can out rock ""the wh""o and all these ""rock bands"" better than anyone else. and this is his middle finger back at the people that thought they couldnt. paul wrote the lyrics after a ride in england. the bealtes where totally high out of their minds locked themselves in the recording room and did this song all night. the song was super long and they cut it to the version we hear today. amazing song.

I think this song is about having sex while you're high. Paul McCartney most likely wrote this song in a girl's POV.

""When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide,
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.""

Basically, Paul (still in a girl's POV) is describing the different sex positions and how she's so high she's comparing the experience to a slide.

Both:
""I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you."" - refers to how she's about to cum but she's still higher than he is.
""I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you"" - refers to how she's about to cum (again) but doesn't want him to yet.

Which is also why the song laters says ""She's coming down fast, yes she is."" in the guy's POV (or Paul's)

The chorus ""Helter Skelter"" is just another reference to their sex experience or a possible orgasm.

The entire song is just one correlation for a crazy sexual exp.

I love Nick Caves & pj`s version of this song.
its lyrics are based around a 1930`s version by dick justice.

""Get down, get down, little Henry Lee, and stay all night with me.
The very best lodging I can afford will be fare better'n thee.""
""I can't get down, and I won't get down, and stay all night with thee,
For the girl I have in that merry green land, I love far better'n thee.""

She leaned herself against a fence, just for a kiss or two;
With a little pen-knife held in her hand, she plugged him through and through.
""Come all you ladies in the town, a secret for me keep,
With a diamond ring held on my hand I'll never will forsake.""

""Some take him by his lily-white hand, some take him by his feet.
We'll throw him in this deep, deep well, more than one hundred feet.
Lie there, lie there, loving Henry Lee, till the flesh drops from your bones.
The girl you have in that merry green land still waits for your return.""

""Fly down, fly down, you little bird, and alight on my right knee.
Your cage will be of purest gold, in deed of property.""
""I can't fly down, or I won't fly down, and alight on your right knee.
A girl would murder her own true love would kill a little bird like me.""

""If I had my bend and bow, my arrow and my string,
I'd pierce a dart so nigh your heart your wobble would be in vain.""
""If you had your bend and bow, your arrow and your string,
I'd fly away to the merry green land and tell what I have seen.""

I've used it as an away message quite a few times over the years, I love morbid things and this is one of the most morbid songs I've ever heard. for some reason, it reminds me of john steinbeck's east of eden... heh, cathy trask...

""lie there, lie there, little henry lee
til the flesh drops from your bones
for the girl you have in that merry green land
can wait forever for you to come home,""

this is my favorite verse in the song, and the imagery I get of a single bird watching the events unfold... perfect.

it's definitely some evil subject matter, but that's what makes it so delicious. it's a perfect combination of talent, if you ask me (pj and nick).

			My mother just passed away this Sunday and this was the last song I played for her.  To me it symbolized her battle with cancer; the cold winter was the battle, but the sun was god coming for her to take away all the pain and that everything was going to be alright.

I don't think this song is about summer. It's about being happy. Being sad (long cold lonely winter) and then being happy again (here comes the sun).
A very nice tune. Love it, one of my fav from George.

I love this song, it always makes me feel happy! George Harrison decided not to attend a meeting with Apple and went to Eric Claptons' house. While there he walked around the garden with one of Claptons' guitars and wrote a love song. It is about tomorrow, and the optimism it brings. It has no underlying negativity, or cryptic ideologies. It gives you a sense of something that is coming, something so clear and beneficial. Happiness.
It is refreshing; a cold sunny morning.

When George wrote this song, I think what he was trying to say that every new day brings a chance to start all over and forget the mistakes you made in the past, and that anyone has this opportunity.  George talks about winter and the cold and it seems to me that those represent the hardships that he's ready to leave behind to start a new

I can't stop listening to this song lately.

I am going through a huge spiritual awakening.  After years of addiction, self will and turning my back on God, I have finally let him into my life.  And He is working miracles.

This song captures it all for me.  After that long, cold, dark spiritual winter - the sun (Son?) is finally peeking through.  I feel that ice is slowly melting.  It feels like years since it's been here.  The warmth, the hope, the optimism - all returning like Spring after a cold winter.  After all the years of worry, anxiety, self-will, resentment, anger, fear - I have turned my life over to God.  And - like George Harrison said - I finally feel like ""it's allright"".

George was getting sick of the music business.  it had lost its fun with everyone telling him to ""play this, sign this, do this.""  he wanted a break, so he went to his good friend eric clapton's house to relax.  he borrowed one of erics acoustic guitars and went for a walk in the garden.  he strummed a chord, looked up into the sky just as a cloud passed away from the sun, and said to the sun ""here comes the sun and its alright.""

This song reminds me of my friends' mom, Angie. She LOVED this song. When she passed away a little over a year ago, it was one of the hardest things in life for me. First funeral I've ever been to. They also played this at her funeral. Even though it makes sad to know she's gone, but I'll definitely never forget her. Now, I think of it in a good way. Remind myself of all the memories I have of her. It brings me to tears, because I can still hear her voice, her laugh. They're happy tears, though. She was such a beautiful woman. I miss seeing her little short self, hearing her jokes, seeing her smile, & even saying my name. I can still hear it. I just know she's in a better place jamming out with some of The Beatles, living the dream. :) So, R.I.P. Angelia Cooper. Love & miss you. Gone but never forgotten. You'll forever be my always.

I think this song is far more personal to James than being about soldiers off to war but everyone is entitled to their interpretation. It has a great dream like quality, rich in symbolism. Ultimately it is about James' feelings toward his mother. Remember that he starts the song addressing his mother. 

There is a tradition where a lighted candle is lit and left in the window to help travellers find their way back home. In this song it sets a metaphor of the home being the family and the love that holds the family together. That love keeps a person returning to their family, their mother, throughout the journey of life. The travelers represent the author who like all children sets out on the journey of life looking to be cared for. A hero is someone who saves you, protects you and cares for you. This also the role of a mother. The Hero of the Day that he seeks is his mother.

But in this case something is wrong because the window itself is lit on fire suggesting that the person at home is over zealous in their desire for the travellers to return. Their love could actually destroy the home. The idea of being overwhelmed by his mother's love is common in James lyrics, like the Apron strings around his neck in Mama Said or the fury he feels in Dyer's Eve. And just as in Dyer's Eve he feels unprepared to face the world due to being sheltered from it by his mother, James expresses that same fear and anger toward his mother because now that he is on this journey and she is gone he feels vulnerable to the world and worries that he may fall by someone's wicked ways. He wonders if his mother can hear her baby crying, does she know the pain he feels? All he can hear is her sighing. Now that she is dead all that remains is the whispers of her voice in her mind.

As the song progresses you feel that transition from the soothing mellow intro that is like being cradled by his mother's love to that furious anger expressed as the music breaks into the verse about the dreams and the waking screams which is him living through the pain and anger he feels toward a mother he can no longer reconcile with. And then of course the song ends with the repetition of the whole point of the song,  that the world is trying to break him and his need to feel her love again. Always James wants love but is afraid of it because love is control to him.

Yeah I agree that it's definitely about war...

Now, deservingly, this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair'

Maybe talking about flashbacks but now he's safe..

'Don't want your aid
But the fist I make
For years can't hold or feel'

He doesn't want anyone's help..

But now the dreams and waking screams
That ever last the night

Again,flashbacks..

'So can you hear your babies crying now?'

In agreence that this could be vietnam reference as when the war was on Johnson was preoccupied with it and ignored problems at home in America...

@grungeJUNKIE03 















First, this is a fantastic song because it can mean so many different things to so many different people.  That said, let me give what it means to me.

The first part of the song is a reference to soldiers going off to war and how there thoughts are always on home.  The line ""if they should fall by someone's wicked way"" is about falling in battle.

The second part is about how so many soldiers continue to fight the war after they come home. ""no, I'm not all me"" is about how a soldier is forever changed into a different person by war, while ""things return to me that still seem real"" is a clear reference to PTSD, along with ""but now the dreams and waking screams that ever last the night"".  

I think the song refers to how a soldier going off to war is ""the hero of the day"" and then how different it is when they come home.  Even things like ""don't want your aid"", clearly about how a lot of soldiers try to deal with PTSD themselves instead of seeking help.
Just my 2 cents worth.

it's pretty vague lyrically, as it seems to almost be talking about different things. what i feel he is saying is similar to mo0stah, but it involves looking up to someone who is not quite the hero of the day you thought they were.

@DrivenInHiFi 















Hero of the Day Interpretation: Personal victory is within our reach. Each person in this war is fighting not to win, but to find their honor.  
What if someone fighting, dies in vein? 
The fight is so long and hard, it's easy to become discouraged.  Keepers of these inner flames that thirst for honor, can you acknowledge
the ones who care about you, praying for your safe return from your journey?  Your loved ones want you with them, not your dream of
personal conquest.  Will the enemy break my will?  They haven't relented.  Now this fight seems so vein, remembering the reason I was brought here.
It seems I can relax now, I've remembered the reason for the fight, I shall deservingly sit on the chair of righteousness.  But it's too late, I can't return
back to the way things were because I now live in shame for my vanity.  I've made these mistakes, and now I have to reconcile them without confiding
in the ones I've loved, I have to do it myself(or with God).  I've become a hardened person fighting this war. I've lost the ability to feel.
Please excuse me while I fight my inner demons so that I can save myself from making anyone else a hardened person.  So I seek emotional shelter while
I recover from the trauma of fighting, until I've cleansed myself of the demons(little metal things coming out of the kid's ear, unconsciousness is the 
wall in this case).  The war in my mind continues, I have to fight these demons before it's too late and I can never feel emotion again.  Mama, they try 
and break me while I cleanse myself of these inner demons.  They try, but I will put up my best fight.  Even if I fail, at least I've tried.  The metal
demons are expunged from the kid's mind, the inner battle will eventually die down and peace will be restored.

Lost in the world with only one person to look to. This sentence basically sums everything up for me. Both released versions of this song are awesome, but I like to think the S&M version is better due to the deeper, melancholy sounds to it. To me, the one person I can look to to understand my feelings and thoughts is myself, so naturally, I find this song to be of great intriguing value to myself.

This song was written be Paul to Julian, John and Cynthia Lennon's son. 
John and Cynthia had just been divorced, and Julian, being young, didn't understand what was happening between his parents, but did feel bad about it. So Paul wrote this song on his way to John's house. So in a way, this song is about divorce. This song was originally titled ""Hey Jules"" because of Julian's nickname, Jules, but Jude naturally sounded better. 
Hey Jude was probably one of John's favorite Paul songs.

@flamingpie Jude obviously sounds better only because he used it. I'm not saying you don't know what you're talking about but—what on earth does it have to do with little kid? The problem with interpretations is that, well it's not a problem at all, it's almost with all great art people walk away with their own ideas. I'd say that even artists themselves mostly can't relate to something they wrote at the time further down the line. People change. It seems to me this song is about an individual who's isolated and wounded by the past. The past haunts Jude. And John reassures him that he can do it. It's a kind song. It's really quite something else.

For me this song is about someone, whos struggling to take the leap towards the life he wants to live and hes made for. He found a girl that he desperately wants to be with and he is afraid to make that step towards her. For he always worries about too many things, he carries the world on his shoulders even tho he is not responsible for every problem in the world. I think hes making things too complicated by thinking too much about them. He is adviced to be himself and not act cool in order to win the girl's heart. Also the change towards the desired life is all on his shoulders, saying he alone has the power to get what he seeks. He just has to take that leap.
This is what this song means to me, not what McCartney or anybody said what it is about.

			I absolutely think you are highlighting some great points.  About 90-95% of these comments highlight how this is related to divorce or family issues and drugs.  While McCartney may have been influenced emotionally by these factors, I think this song was made for a different purposes.  And Some people care about the tune (yes it may be catchy of course, but that's not the only thing that matters).

Yes the tune is an iconic one and this song will be forever a historic piece.

But if you look closely at this song, it can have a pretty powerful message.  Especially for those who relate to it most.  In a smiple straightforward way- Linewalker put it in good words.  It is about making steps forward in your own life and letting the strong Love you have potentially found mold you into becoming a stronger person.  Being lonely and stuck can be the worst feeling, but using a desire a motivation can be a great thing.  Especially if you are lucky enough to find a very special woman/girl.  One you would undeniably crave to perform with.  One who sticks with you even if you haven't gotten to know her too well.  It could be like having a lightbulb through the haze.  She might be original (which can be very attractive), may be sharp, creative, calm/peaceful, a free-spirit, loyal, have a lot of depth or (any of these special kind of traits) and sometimes that is what us people truly look for.  Companionships are harder to come across these days.

			I agree. Paul McC's Catholicism insinuates itself into many Beatles songs.
""The movement you need is on your shoulder"" seems to me like Paul telling John to stop carrying the cross for the entire Anti-war youth movement - as if to say ""stop making yourself into the Messiah of the hippy-anti-war left-wing peace thing - it's already been accomplished through Christ. 
This goes right along with Lennon's song ""Ballad of John & Yoko"". 
['The way things are going'....etc.]

I probably overthought this but it's just as far-fetched as all the heroin interpretations here !

I think it's not about the religion or the decay of our ""godless"" civilization. I think it's about searching for knowledge in different places at different times. It's also about media & popular culture.
While there was time when people went to Memphis to aquire some experience (a place where blues musicians made music so great that it seemed they were selling their souls to the devil), but the protaginist chooses Geneva to be the place he can learn something important.
The protagonist is the present-day missionnaire / a present-day blues musician (in my opinion, 'blues' is here synonymous to 'knowledge'): he will preach & ""teach it to you"". There is always a cost of any knowledge: either it is small pox & flu, or a bullet in Lorraine motel, or death under unknown circumstances.
There is also kind of knowledge, which is useless and does no harm (a teenage icon Miley Cirus aka Hannah Montana swimming in her pool). The connection between all these pieces is that all of them represent the culture in a certain period of time and people's obsession by it (by accepting it, learning it, teaching it, etc.). Still, it's quite unstable: ""I can't remember anything at all"". Might be, there is just one thing that really matters and stays: the protagonist's realtionship with another human being (""you are the best girl I've ever had"").

On the second thought, these checkpoints on the protagonist's memory lane might be just alternative Universes (whose existence might be proven in Geneva some day) :)

@Ajnochka The CERN large hadron collider (where the Higgs Boson particle was first found) is just outside Geneva, just across the border into France. I agree with your interpretation, and believe the reason Geneva was mentioned is due to the collider.

			A really well thought interpretation!   Thanks for this.  I'm still at the ""impression only"" phase with this song.  It has a delirious feeling to it.  It also gives me the impression that it is ahead of it's time, anticipating a future where we might make quantum leaps in discovery of the natural world that shake human cosmological views in time.

The reference to Robert Johnson is much deeper. The legend is that he sold his soul to the devil and got guitar skills for it instead. However:
'He got the real killer groove
Robert Johnson and the devil, man
Don't know who is gonna rip off who'
Johnson is so skilled that he can beat the devil. Like people that found the god particle and could (once) surpass god.

			Didn't know this, thanks for clarifying! I feel like another jigsaw falls into place.			

It seems he's making a parallel between the story of Robert Johnson (blues musician who purportedly ""sold his soul to the devil"" in exchange for guitar skills) and our discovery of the Higgs Boson particle. This ""don't know who is gonna rip off who"" part is the real issue -- did we compromise anything in order to make this discovery, and what impact will it have on our world? Will it help us as a society or will it lead us down a path of further environmental destruction?

The ""Higgs Boson Blues"" seems to suggest that the future holds little direction or meaning. The discovery of the Higgs Boson completed the Standard Model of particle physics, so where do we go from here?

The only thing we can be certain of is our impending mortality, and it can come with little warning to anyone, no matter their moral standing. He paints a picture of the assassination of Martin Luther King at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis as a jarring example of this.

In the great uncertainty that follows death, material requests like ""bury me in my favorite yellow patent leather shoes"" seem trivial. Our society's superficial fixation on celebrities like Miley Cyrus seem especially banal in the wake of this.

The line ""look here comes the missionary with his smallpox and flu"" describes a double edged sword. We are always searching for ways to better our society, but it comes at a cost.

			I like what you're saying. I think the ""higgs boson blues"" might refer to the ""double edged sword"" you refer to, in that new ideas/knowledge or what ever always seems to come at some terrible cost. Maybe in this he is imagining that the CERN experiment failed and destroyed the world, the most extreme example of this...

I'm pretty sure all of that business about the Lorraine Motel is regarding the assassination of MLK. He was shot as he was standing on the balcony off room 306. The motel is now the National Civil Rights Museum. The man preaching in a language that's completely new is MLK. 

I get a strong sense of existential dread from this song. The whole idea of sitting in a ""basement patio"" (What is that, exactly? Probably just a dark, sad basement.) while girls walk by outside with roses in bloom. It implies to me that all of these things: the Higgs Boson, Miley Cyrus and celebrity culture, the deaths of our revolutionaries, the legends that we surround ourselves with, are weighing him down. 

I think this is one of the ""biggest"" songs Nick has ever written. It's arguably the best song of 2013.

@jimah I absolutely agree! Existential dread is what I get. I wonder if Nick WANTS to believe in the soul, but the Higgs Boson... well, he wants to believe in some kind of meaning, but doesn't know if he can anymore amid all evidence seeming to point to the contrary. In 20,000 Days On Earth it looked like he'd given up on his very defining ramblings about God, which he said were most pervasive in his writing when he was on a lot of drugs, so I think he's coming to terms with a world where, looking, as a sober person, objectively, it seems like the self is really all there is. No soul, no plan, no big picture, rudderless, screws and nails falling out of planks, and the ""Devil"" is man-made.
Not necessarily my views, but his case is compelling. Or perhaps I just hear my own current existential crisis in his lyrics when he meant something else entirely.
It make me want to cry actually. I even felt sad for Miley Cyrus when I thought she drowned at the end. But Nick said he thinks she's probably just on a lilo.

This is what a ""blues"" should sound nowadays. Nick has talked about this one as the depiction of the general decay and confusion ruling our reality nowadays (referring also to Hannah Montana, which is the only discording note, she's there to contrast with naivety and unaware calm all the chaos around). Of course the decay is especially spiritual; I believe that the Higgs Boson fits because its revelation in a way (in a very collateral, poetic way) denies the existence of a God. A world in which God is denied, all kind of stuff happen, some other stuff are justified by it (black babies dying, Marthin Luther shot dead, Robert Johnson dead with any given credit -- basically there's just Lucipher hanging around like it's nothing). There's also a sarcastic look at science, on the other side, when he goes like: ""here comes the missionary"" -- maybe a doctor without borders carrying vaccines and knownledge like everything is under control, and everything can be explained. But in a messed up world without any God, nothing can ever make sense and 2+2 always make a 5. So in the end, Cave suggests he's just accepting the way things roll and flow; we're in a mess, no matter what they discover in Geneva. He does this long journey thro the whole human chaos but ends up defied in his basement patio, just like Miley Cirus in a way. But at the end of the day who cares? Who cares what the future brings?

			You broke it down precisely as I have. I wish I had friends like you who would pick songs apart with me, haha. 			

You need to know a little about the Higgs Boson, and a little about Nick Cave to get this song. Nick is not a typical Christian, but he is a Christian, so the spiritual decay he sees is not some request to put prayer in schools, or for people to follow his religion or something, it is a deeper, existential crisis in modern society. The Higgs Boson is called the ""God particle"" because it is an attempt by physics to find the most elementary particle, the particle that is essentially at the bottom of everything. Now that they've found it, there is no fulfillment, nothing is better, and the spiritual crises is still there, God particle or no. It's an existential emptiness type thing. Lines like ""saving the savages with the Higgs Boson blues"" are easily explained by reading people like Christopher Hitchens writing about howt he Iraq war was a good idea to civilize people, and bring them our wonderful, perfect modern ways of life and views. The references to MIley Cyrus are obvious, she is a great poster child of our empty, fame-groping, celebrity obsessed pop culture.

			Nick Cave's relationship with religion and God has always been quite complex. He was brought up Anglican but didn't identify very much with the God that was presented to him. He talks in lot of his early interviews of a more personal identification with God, removed from the dogmatic trappings of church services. He's also talked a great deal over the years about his doubts, and in one interview said specifically, “I don’t think a person truly believes unless they doubt as well. My faith kind of swells up and subsides”. 

Whatever his specific beliefs are at any given point in time, he's always drawn inspiration from religion and spirituality in his work, and it's ok to interpret his work through that lens as chances are that really was what he was going for.

""Higgs Boson Blues""
-----
Higgs Boson particle (aka God particle) is the very fundamental particle that explain many things. It has been discovered in CERN lab in Geneva. In these lyrics we can see it as a metaphor of the God. Blues is referring to the Blues music and at the same time to sadness. So I interpret the title as : The sad God.
Why he is sad? We'll see in the rest of the lyrics
----


Can't remember anything at all
Flame trees line the streets
Can't remember anything at all
But I'm driving my car down to Geneva
-----
Driving car to Geneva, where the God (Boson Particle) has been discovered.
In other words, he is searching for the God. I like to see god as being that has the answer to everything. Answer to all our needs and our question. An escape from the darkness. And he wants to find that God.
-----

I've been sitting in my basement patio
Aye, it was hot
Up above, girls walk past, the roses all in bloom
Have you ever heard about the Higgs Boson blues
I'm goin' down to Geneva baby, gonna teach it to you
------
We can see two side in this world. One is sad and dark one because you can see the beyond of the meaningless circle of life. And the other one is bright, and blooming. Belongs to the people in modern world who are enjoying their superficial life. 
Then he mentions the sad God. And he wants to teach it to the people that, meaninglessly, are living up above. We'll see his teaching in the reminder of the lyrics.
---------


Who cares, who cares what the future brings?
Black road long and I drove and drove
I came upon a crossroad
The night was hot and black
I see Robert Johnson,
With a ten dollar guitar strapped to his back,
Lookin' for a tune
------
He, again,  mentions that the world is dark and he is seeking a meaning, a real light in this darkness by driving to Geneva (God's place).
On his way he sees Rober Johnson, which according to Eric Clapton was the most influential Blues guitarist. There's myth about Johnson says he sold his soul to the Lucifer in order to become a great blues musician. So here R. Johnson is going to meet Lucifer in order to make a deal with him.
------

Well here comes Lucifer,
With his canon law,
And a hundred black babies runnin' from his genocidal jaw
He got the real killer groove
Robert Johnson and the devil man
Don't know who's gonna rip off who
-------
So here's the confrontation of the Lucifer and Johnson. But in the Cave's version seems he is not going to sell his soul to the devil. And there's a fight between them. His miraculous music, for sure, is from something divine, from heaven. How it is possible to acquire this divine music from Lucifer?

It's noteworthy that Johnson died because he drunk a poisonous wine. Who poisoned the wine? A jealous husband whom Johnson flirted with his wife. We can see this matter also as a fight between him and Lucifer. Lucifer finally killed him with the help of a temptation and a jealous husband.
–----- 

Driving my car, flame trees on fire
Sitting and singin' the Higgs Boson blues,
I'm tired, I'm lookin' for a spot to drop
All the clocks have stopped in Memphis now
In the Lorraine Motel, it's hot, it's hot
That's why they call it the Hot Spot
I take a room with a view
-------
Again, he sees the world as a dark hell. In many Biblical notes hell described as  a lake of dark fire.
And he is driving, driving toward the place where they discovered the God. 
Why the earth we live in is like a dark hell? Here he mentions one reason:
It was on this earth, in Lorraine Motel at Memphis, where Martin Luther King Jr. was killed. An innocent individual, warrior of the lightness, who was looking for freedom and equality bled to the death there. 
------


Hannah Montana does the African Savannah
As the simulated rainy season begins
She curses the queue at the Zulus
And moves on to Amazonia
And cries with the dolphins
Mama ate the pygmy
The pygmy ate the monkey
The monkey has a gift that he is sending back to you
Look here comes the missionary
With his smallpox and flu
He's saving them savages
With his Higgs Boson Blues
I'm driving my car down to Geneva
I'm driving my car down to Geneva
------
Here we can see a comparison of that superficial meaningless modern world and the sad reality on other side of this planet. Hannah Montana might be the best symbol of the corporate-created superficial celebrity. She does African rain dance and the result a meaningless simulated rain. She cries for the dolphins. But they are fake as crocodile tears. This modern life, which she is a very symbol of, is the main reason of dolphins' death. 

Here, he focuses on how AIDS firstly created because of poverty of the poor people of the Africa. I think he regards himself as the missionary. A messionary that makes you sick. He opens you eyes to the dark sad truth. With his Higgs Boson Blues. With the sad reality he carries with himself. (Remember, I said God is the being that has the answers, that has the reality). 

So we search for the God. Maybe he can save us from this dark hell of a world. But the reality is ""God Blues"" himself. He wasn't sad if he could offer a solution.
-----

Oh let the damn day break
The rainy days always make me sad
Miley Cyrus floats in a swimming pool in Toluca Lake
And you're the best girl I've ever had
Can't remember anything at all
-------
And again happy people up above are swimming in their pool. And they don't care about the sad part of the world. But who he sees the darkness, crimes, and inhumanity. And cares, belongs to the dark basement, Down here. 
Let's drive to Geneva. Who knows maybe we can find something maybe we can change something....

Love this song. Very inspirational. So much historical value.

It's obviously about not giving up and working hard toward your goals. It presents 2 ""impossible"" things, an ant carrying a rubber tree plant, and a ram punching a hole in a dam. These things are obviously ""impossible"" but then it talks about how through persistence, they were able to accomplish what they were previously told was impossible. This is a perfect campaign theme song for a politician, and it was indeed used by J F Kennedy in his 1960 campaign. It's incredibly easy to surrender to futility against the enormous array of the world's ills. But you have to keep fighting and through persistence, they can indeed be solved.

This song is about being brave enough to take chances, emphasizing that if you don't do anything your dreams stay far away
The fist verse expresses this:

It's the boy you never told I like you,
It's the girl you let get away.
It's the one you saw that day on the train,
But you freaked out and walked away.

The song is basically encouraging people to live life to the fullest, and take chances in life

I think this song is about some people in her life that are helping her getting famous in the music industry, maybe a producer or something like that. They are supposed to be helping her, walking her across a fragile line, trying to help her finding the right way in a tricky business but they are not quite right for her because they are rushing her and shushing her and so she refers to them as demons and the devil. They are begging her to open up her mouth as in rushing her to write another song but she needs them so it makes the words come out mechanically, she is in a way forcing herself to write a good song for them. She talks about how she sold her soul to a three-piece (a man wearing a suit) and he told her she was holy but he has got her down on both knees, she needs his help and would at this point do anything he tells her to do but she still knows that he is the devil who is just trying to hold her down. 
This is what I get when i'm listening to this song, it just makes so much sense when you think about it like that.

TW: RAPE (GRAPHIC)

i believe this song to be about rape from a man.

""my demons are begging me to open up my mouth
i need them, mechanically make the words come out""
he's telling her to open her mouth to suck his cock, and that she needs to do this, because it's best for her.

""they fight me, vigorous and angry, watch them pounce
ignite me, licking up the flames they bring about""
when she rejects what the raper says, he forces it onto her. she's angry now because of him (""ignite me""), but it just turns him on, and forces it further.

""i sold my soul to a three-piece
and he told me i was holy
he's got me down on both knees""
upon her first encounter with this guy, she thought he was nice because he had a very clean appearance. now it's all gone wrong.

""but it's the devil that's tryna
hold me down, hold me down
sneaking out the back door, make no sound""
he's got her, and now he's not letting her go. the rapist is covering her mouth so no one hears her pleas for help. 

""knock me out, knock me out
saying that i want more, this is what i live for""
now he's trying to give her drugs, and attempting to convince her that this is what she wants. this is what she lives for.

""throw me in the deep end, watch me drown""
not only does he find it humane to do this, he takes pleasure in it.

""selfish, taking what i want and call it mine
i'm helpless, clinging to a little bit of spine""
she's fallen into it now, and is starting to take pleasure in it as well. she's starting to take more dominance in the intercourse, but the rapist comes back even stronger.

""they rush me, telling me i'm running out of time
they shush me (sssh), walking me across a fragile line""
the rapist has other things to do, and is fearing getting caught. she's getting loud now, and he's being even more assertive, controlling every action of hers.

The song seems to be born of a sexual and religious experience. They could be the same experience or she could just be drawing a parallel. 

""I sold my soul to a three-piece
And he told me I was holy
He's got me down on both knees
But it's the devil that's tryna...""

She wrote the song after flying over Las Vegas. In an interview, she said that she was contemplating how a place could allow for so many bad things, but they were accepted because what happens there stays there. It's a city made for vice- a bizarre concept.

"
480,Holding on to You.json,"
I think this song is about being depressed and suicidal. 
""You are surrounding all my surroundings. Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes."" that to be sounds like depression being all around you and effecting how you see things.

""I'm taking over my body. back in control, no more shotty. I bet a lot of me was lost ""T""'s uncrossed and ""I""'s undotted. I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got."" This to me sounds like he's taking control of himself again, he's fighting back. But when he was under, going through deep depression, a lot of him was lost. 

""And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds. You should take my life, you should take my soul"" I think that's depression's opinion coming back, with some suicidal thoughts.

""Time is slowin' and it's rolling still, and the windowsill looks really nice, right? You think twice about your life, It probably happens at night, right?"" That's like a panic attack, and the windowsill part is implying jumping out of it and committing suicide. and it happens at night, because that's the typical time that you feel alone and hopeless and there's no one to stop you.

""Fight it, take the pain, ignite it. Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breath fine and tie it to a tree tell it, you belong to me, this ain't a noose, this is a leash and I have news for you, you must obey me!"" This part is about owning your depression.

@companioncube some people feel better at night because at night you can escape free to imagine another world and think good thoughts when in the day you feel like you are surrounded by people who don't understand what you're going through and you feel more alone. so the 'you think twice about your life it probably happens at night, right?' only applies to some people. and MusicHandle I agree with you about the windowsill part.

@companioncube Your interpretation is spot on, except I think a couple lines mean something else. I think you're definitely right that it's about fighting depression. But the liner notes on the CD thank Jesus Christ, whom Tyler and Josh call their ""lord and savior."" I think the part of the song about ""you should take my life, you should my soul"" is directed toward God. And so is, I believe, ""I'll be holding on to you."" If you watch the video, at the end, Tyler points up when he says ""you."" Instead of relying on the power of his flesh, he's giving his life, his soul to God, because he cannot fight the depression alone. And he's suggesting to other people that they entertain the idea of doing the same thing. We were ""gifted"" with thought, and using that gift of thought, we can at least entertain Tyler's faith. He's not telling people to believe what he believes, but he's sharing about what he holds onto, sharing about his faith, and he's suggesting we get ""introspective"" and think for ourself about that message.

I'm sure the guys in Twenty One Pilots would probably want their listeners to interpret the lyrics personally, so I'll just say that WHAT I THINK personally (for me) is that they're talking about holding onto FAITH to overcome personal (flesh-based) problems - in this case, suicidal/depression-type thoughts. He's saying flesh is all he's got, and he can't trust himself, so he's going to try to control his mind (put a leash on it) and just give it over to God - telling God to take his life, take his soul - and let God surround him. And he's also talking to other people who struggle with the same problems (""at night, right?""), telling them to also entertain faith. BUT he's making it clear that people shouldn't just follow these lyrics - he doesn't mean it that way - he's saying people should think for themselves - because God gifted us with the power of thought.

I agree that it's about coming out of depression, but there is more to it than that. It's about the person/ people or things that you hold on to in order to get out of the depression. I have been depressed for a little more than a year now and I despretly cling to anything that makes me happy. It makes me look kind of obsessive but, I love orange (the color) so almost every thing I own is orange, I'm absolutely in love with Fall Out Boy (the band) so I listen to every song they have everyday, I'm a very very loyal friend, there's alot. That's what this somg says to me.

He states, ""you should take my life you should take my soul"" and probably means that he has seen or done too much in his life that terrible and trying to maintain it all in his mind. In the music video he is being surrounded/grabbed by skeletons or demons. I think these show that these ""demons"" inside him are ripping him apart on the inside and he is trying to stay together mentally.

I think it has to do with coming out of depression. 
""I'm taking over my body
Back in control"" and ""And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life
It probably happens at night, right?"" shows about how the person has gone through it and wants to get back in control.

			So this is when s/he chooses to be with others instead of someone she LIES about wanting to be with???? Yup. Thought so. Again, we should all exprience such depression. 			






			So this is when s/he chooses to be with others instead of someone she LIES about wanting to be with???? Yup. Thought so. Again, we should all exprience such depression. 			

I know quite a few people who go to church with these guys and most of their songs have Christian subtext; this one is about coming to Christ and dying to one's self (""You should take my life, You should take my soul"") and holding onto Him through that transition (""Holding on to you..."" and ""Entertain my faith"").

@LNJ Mate thanks for your interpretation. This makes me appreciate an awesome song even more!			






@LNJ Mate thanks for your interpretation. This makes me appreciate an awesome song even more!			

To me the song's definitely about depression, and since I suffer from it it connects so well with me. 

""Tie a noose around your mind
Loose enough to breath fine and tie it
To a tree tell it,
You belong to me, this ain't a noose
This is a leash and I have news for you
You must obey me!"" 
- probably the most powerful part of the song. It shows that even though you live with depression you can overcome it and control it. I feel like he really has some issues because many of his songs are like this. I also like how he's calling out hip hop: 
""Lean with it, rock with it
When we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing
We were gifted with thought

Is it time to move our feet
To an introspective beat
It ain't the speakers that bump hard
It's our hearts that make the beat""

basically saying how in hiphop now all it's about is catchy beats and dance moves, relying more on the speakers than your own mind. We were gifted with thought, so we should use it to its fullest potential, not just to make a catchy song

			I feel you!!!! I love what you said, especially the hip hop part.  			

All the depression themes have been mentioned, why I agree, it is about someone trying to overcome depression, but is so evident that this song is about God. The whole chorus is about the Holy Spirit, 

""You are surrounding all my surroundings"" 
God is always with you. 
""Sounding down the mountain range
Of my left-side brain""
The left side of the brain is said to be the 'logical' part, meaning that all of his logical thinking is sort of reliant on God. 
""You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope
Behind both of my eyes""
God is the one that shifts his views so he can see more than meets the eye. 
""And I'll be holding onto you."" 
Come on. 

There's heaps of other little references in the verses as well
As well as sort of worshiping God, it's more than it. It's to inspires others to start thinking about their own, to use our knowledge to our advantage rather then leave it dormant. This song is fantastic in juxtaposition to ""Car radio"" as they both have similar morals.

			I agree with part of what you said. In the end of the music video, when he is singing ""And I'll be holding on to you"" he point up, as in to the sky, and that is when I thought that this part might be where he is saying he is holding on to God to come out of depression. But the chorus seems more like it is talking about depression. I think this because he is saying the ""you are (...) twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes"", which to me means that depression is making him see things differently, twisting his thinking, his ""left-side brain"". Those are my two cents. BUT music is always subjective, which is the beauty of it.			







0








 
			Absolutely. Listeners who aren't aware the chorus is basically a praise to God/the Holy Spirit are truly missing a huge chunk of meaning to this song. The songwriter is desperately trying to cling to God and what he knows to be true about God in the midst of the dark places his mind takes him to.			







0








 
@Aetyruzen Wow I never took it this way, but that could very well be it. I think its fine if people who aren't religious take it a different way though, and take it as holding on to their friends and loved ones since everyone copes with their problems in different ways. 			







0








 
@Aetyruzen it could be interpreted like that absolutely, but its somewhat subtle enough as to where non christians (like myself) can still connect to it very strongly. to me, the ""You are surrounding all my surroundings"" and ""This aint a noose this is a leash and I have news for you, you must obey me!"" parts relate to depression, because i have severe depression and thats what it feels like to me.But again, it could be interpreted many different ways, and this is a valid one.

It doesn't matter who covers this track, it belongs to Burl...heart and soul. Christmas (for me, anyway) would not be Christmas w/o the Burls, Bings, Andrews, Coles, Martin's, the large choirs, etc. They came at a time when life moved slower, choices were more limited, family was more important, modern technology was only just beginning, so songs (especially holiday songs) really mattered.

I believe that this song relates to many Californians, not to say that other cultures or people from different places can't relate to it. What I'm saying, is that this song represents the dream of hollywood handing you everything you could dream for. Yet it asks only for your soul in return.
As said within the song lyrics, ""when you're rich that you sold yourself for this"", thus showing the meaning of people giving up everything and everyone for a shot at fame and fortune. Yet they don't realize the path that it will lead and how all of it is only a soft, velvet, fading illusion and the moment you touch it, it will dissolve at your fingertips.

			I think it's not necessarily about Californians specifically, but more about people who think that if they ""go Hollywood"" or become famous, their life will be perfect, whereas becoming famous can lead you to becoming materialistic, conceited, a drunkard, etc. 

The general message that I'm getting is that sometimes, things aren't as good as they seem.

I'd like to add that where it says:
""So you want to be a rock star
With blue eyed bunnies in your bed
Well remember when you're rich that you sold yourself for this, you'll be famous cause you're dead.""
I think he is referring to Kurt Cobain, who received most of his fame after he passed.

The song was actually written for Michael's long-time ex-girlfriend. He's said so in a bunch of interviews and stuff. Basically it's him telling her that he misses her, but he understands why she can't/won't go with him on his tour. And that he'll be back as soon as he can. They broke up later anyway, which was when he wrote ""Lost"".

To me this song can be interpreted in two ways. 

A musician on tour. If you've ever seen the music video shot for this it is just footage of Michael on tour which could explain the whole long distance relationship thing. 

It could also be interpreted as a soldier's song home. A lot of soldiers from the earlier times never sent their letters back, they just kept them (reason I don't know) and soldiers travel a lot to different countries... I don't know. 

I am just guessing.

You be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi

That line always makes me giggle.  

Having been to neither one of those states, I always kind of draw a blank - ""You be my (random southern state), I'll be your (other random southern state)"".  

What are the attributes of each that work as a metaphor for the singer (Mississippi) and his girl (Louisiana)?  Could ""Arkansas"" and ""South Carolina"" have worked as well?  Or, shouldn't the girl be MISSissippi?  And ""I"" (the singer) be LOUISiana? 

Is there a special relationship, a history, between the states of Mississippi and Louisiana that I don't know about?  

A really fun, breezy, summery song, of course.   It just sends me off on that tangent when I hear it.

"
490,Honeymoon Avenue.json,"
I had a boyfriend for 7 months. We had fallen for each other really quickly... In the beginning of the relationship we thought we were invincible because we were so in love, and so attached to the relationship. 

""You know how to drive in rain
You decide and that's okay
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home"" 
..eventually we began to argue over little things and the spark was beginning to drift away, but he didn't think anything of it, but our relationship began heading to that wrong direction. Because of his ex girlfriend, he was used to the fighting and didn't think the ""rain"" or my sadness was too serious so he flew right by it.

""I feel like my heart is stuck
In bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm going to crash
'Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was""
..I felt like I was trapped in the relationship because I wanted to go back to how we were in the beginning: in love.

""When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, Constantly crazy
Can we get back to the way it was""
..to me a ""honeymoon"" is sort of the beginning of something. A celebration where you can't have enough of each other, and just a bunch of emotions.

""Hey, what happened to the butterflies
Guess they were moving kinda fast, that time""
Our relationship started off pretty fast, where we just wanted to I straight to being in love and now those feelings we had are drifting away.

""And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, can we go back to where we found it
But that's if we can turn it around
You're saying baby don't worry
But we're still going the wrong way baby""
..he didn't think much of it, or take it too seriously to a point where that empty feeling we both had wasn't going away.

""Think I'm in love
But we continue to fight
Honey I know
We can find our way home""
..I was ""in love"" with him and didn't want to break up and wanted to keep the relationship going and wanted to try and go back to all that love we had before.

Love this song and ariana grande!

This is about some kid talking to Maynard about Undertow.  The kid, declaring himself a true Tool fan (OGT - Original Gangsta Tool) apparently called MJK a sellout for releasing Undertow, a major label record.  Maynard turns his words around into the chorus that says, ""We all participate in capitalism, so by saying you don't like it, you're being hypocritical.""  He goes on to say that the kid knows nothing about him except for what Maynard lets him know, so he's in no position to tell him how to live.

I disagree. I don't think that he's saying capitalism is the H w/ a P, He's saying that HE's the H w/ a P.  He's like ""You know what buddy, (I love when he says buddy!)

And Maynard is calling him out on his hypocrisy and telling him that unless he's willing to throw away his clothes and get rid of his tattoos, he can just shut his fucking mouth.

This song is a big FUCK to all the ""dip shit"" who repeatedly call bands sell outs. EVERY single band who ever releases an album is litterally a sell out.

You're criticizing, but you're the one getting fucked in the end, so don't tell me what to do."" 

I think we can apply this message to other aspects of the world than the capitalist system. This represents the essence of Maynard's message saying , we all have our flaws, don't be a fuckin' hypocrite and admit that you are a inperfect person as well. The world would be a much more peaceful place if more people thaught this way.

i like that tool throw's out props to the beastie boys.

Honestly, we as fans dont truly know the individuals writing and recording these songs, and I think the point of this entire song is that whether or not TOOL sold out or not is irrelevent because the music that they write and produce continues to be amazing and what we the consumer want more and more of. Honestly, there people just like everyone else. They believe what they want and leave the rest up to the individual to believe what they want. At the end of the day, there pretty awesome and create well thought out and well put togethor music that we all love and enjoy. If that makes them a ""sale out"" then so be it, im going to keep buying there shit.

@walter2boys Actually, Maynard is not giving props to the Beastie Boys (nor is he dissing them). The guy calling Maynard and Tool out as sellouts is meant to be ironic. He purports himself as the hardcore fan, ""The OG"", and all around cool guy, but he's clearly bought into the popular culture of coolness. He's wearing Levi's Jeans, low-pro Vans shoes, has freshly inked tattoos (suggesting he's only recently adopted his identity and sense of style), has typical piercings, and drinks Coca-Cola. The Beastie Boys shirt is just another outward expression of perceived internal coolness. Whose going to ever say the Beastie Boys are not cool? They're edgy and different and cross-over into the hip-hop genre. The shirt could have been Nirvana or Slayer. Clearly this guy's sucking up to ""The Man"" and has failed to realize it. Maybe he also has a chain-wallet, drives some sleek classic car in all black, shops at an independent record stores (not Tower Records), etc.. Calling Maynard/Tool ""sell-outs"" is the ultimate irony as he's the biggest ""buy-in"" on the planet. We can make our own conclusions about the remainder of the song, but I think most people generally interpret it in the same way: Maynard is a musician who makes a living making music. Somehow becoming popular is viewed as negative, while being a poor underground band is considered awesome. Mainstream or not, these bands are making money from the fans who buy their albums, merchandise, and go to their shows. No matter how ""OG"" you think you are, we are all products of consumerism. Great song. I will play it to my kids when the are teenagers going through their identity crises.

Maybe he also has a chain-wallet, drives some sleek classic car in all black, shops at an independent record stores (not Tower Records), etc.. Calling Maynard/Tool ""sell-outs"" is the ultimate irony as he's the biggest ""buy-in"" on the planet. We can make our own conclusions about the remainder of the song, but I think most people generally interpret it in the same way: Maynard is a musician who makes a living making music. Somehow becoming popular is viewed as negative, while being a poor underground band is considered awesome. Mainstream or not, these bands are making money from the fans who buy their albums, merchandise, and go to their shows. No matter how ""OG"" you think you are, we are all products of consumerism. Great song. I will play it to my kids when the are teenagers going through their identity crises.

I would think that having never caught a rabbit would actually help refute the accusation that one is nothing but a hound dog.

Hound Dog was written by Lieber and Stoller for an R&B singer Big Mama Thornton who did a low down and grittier version of it.  It features one of the coolest guitar solos of that time period.  The Elvis version is a more hyperactive version of the song.  No less or better than the original in my opinion just different.  It rocks.  Watching Elvis do the ""raunchy"" version on that old tv show was certainly a big moment in rock and roll history.  I think it's one of the coolest things I've ever seen.

Has anyone heard Robert Palmer's version from his last album 'Drive'? It's a cover of the ORIGINAL blues version. 
Lyrics are:


""You ain't nothin' but a hound dog,
been snoopin' round the door
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog,
been snoopin' round the door
You can wag your tail, 
but I ain't gonna feed you no more

You told me you was high-class,
but I can see through that
You told me you was high-class,
but I can see through that
Now mamma I know you're just an alley cat

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog,
been snoopin' round the door
You're just an old hound dog,
been snoopin' round my door
You can wag your tail, 
but I ain't gonna feed you no more

You nearly had me fooled, 
but I ain't throwing you a bone
You nearly had me fooled, 
but I ain't throwing you a bone
Because you ain't no tiny-dinner (?)
You stole my soul

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog,
been snoopin' round the door
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog,
been snoopin' round the door
You can wag your tail, 
but I ain't gonna feed you no more""

This song is as is implied about a character who believes a friend of his to be a hound - dog, simply because he is crying all of the time. It is possible that if he has some sort of medical condition or mutation which means that he has no tear ducts, and if he has lived an entirely solitary life then he may not realise that human beings are capable of crying, but that he has seen a dog cry before. This is how he mistakes a human being for a species of dog, having seen very few human beings, let alone one in distress enough to cry.
	It is the next section of this song that is considered the most controversial and dubious of all, as the singer refers to his misidentified subject as having never caught a rabbit and not being as friend of his. It has long been a debate amongst musicologists about whether the man who is misidentified as being a canine was not his friend to begin with, or whether being his friendship is subject to having caught a rabbit. May this debate continue for many years.

"
497,House of Gold.json,"
This song is from the perspective of a man whose mother is thinking about what will happen to her when her husband dies. It is possible that she contemplates this as her husband is dying.
  (If there is any doubt that she is saying ""when your father turns to stone"", take into consideration that ""stone"" could be referring to his tombstone.)
   When the man promises all of these things to his mother, it is more of a romantic idea of promising someone anything they desire simply to please them, regardless of whether or not they can really fulfill their promises. It's more of a desperate promise to show the direness of the situation.
(This point is further illustrated when he says ""pretend"" {""Let's say we up and left this town/ And turned our future upside down/ We'll make pretend that you and me/ Live ever after happily""}.)
The next part can be confusing, but is probably best explained through the music video to this song. In the music video, the singer and the drummer (who make up the entirety of Twenty One Pilots) are simply the top half of bodies, the lower half torn off (supposedly by some machinery accident {implied by a bloody machine in a field next to the main singer}). As the singer sings this song, it is implied that he is the son. And seeing that he is torn in half, he is unable to keep his promise (further illustrating the idea of a desperate, unfulfillable promise). TAKING ALL OF THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, the next lines (""And since we know that dreams are dead/ And life turns plans up on their head/ I will plan to be a bum/ So I just might become someone"") make a bit more sense. The singer is acknowledging that his dream of helping his mother once his father passes is unrealized, as he is dead too. (I am not certain I understand the ""bum"" reference, but I assume he means that it is just more hopeless acceptance of his and her dire situation; he is basically accepting failure.)

			In my estimation, your interpretation nails it. I especially appreciate your perspective on the video, as I had still been pondering it, but what you propose makes a lot of sense.

The only thing I would add is in response to your note about the ""bum"" reference. I think the key here is the preceding lyric: ""And life turns plans up on their head."" I suspect he's saying that when we expect things to work out great, life throws us a curveball and we wind up disappointed more often than not. So he's going to do the opposite - set his expectations low (""to be a bum"") and hope that when he gets his curveball from life, the outcome is instead greatness.

Thanks again for the insightful write-up on this great song!

There is no doubt that Tyler is singing about his mom wanting to be taken care of when his father dies but there's so much more to it. Disclaimer this is what I take out of the song; the beauty of lyrics and any form of literature is that everyone takes something different out of it and that's just sick as frick. 

His mother is asking him to do something he physically cannot do and yet he promises to do it anyways. He promises to give his mother everything because he loves her and that's what he wants for her. But we're flawed. ""We're broken people."" We can't do everything. We might as well become bums because no matter how hard we try we can't give the people we love everything want to give them. Referencing the video, we are only half of a person, unable to be and give everything we want to be and give. But we still make these promises even though we know we can't fulfill them. Why? Because we were made by someone who can fulfill those outlandish promises. Someone who isn't tarnished by the disease of sin Tyler promises to cure his mother of even though he himself is affected. There is someone who can cure us of it. There is someone who can make us queens and kings of everything. There is someone who can put us on the map. All you have to do is ask and accept Him.

I feel like this song is pretty straightforward. It's the story of a mother confiding in her son to stay with her and take care of her when no one else can. If you watch the music video for this song, you'll see that Tyler and Josh are only halves crawling to their ""mother."" 

I read somewhere that it's more specifically about the son pursuing his career and then remembering the promise he made to his mom. He's torn between family and his own life.

Well, they don't call it schizoid pop for nothing, do they?

Schizoids, being on the schizophrenic spectrum (though, I must stress, NOT schizophrenic) are often 'split' as the terminology suggests. Our home life was not happy. Our childhoods, deeply flawed. The relationship to the primary caregiver often very complicated, rather dysfunctional, and yet, possessing a potent attachment. (As we don't tend to attach to much else.)

The video is very explanatory. It also has a kind of 'Home' -- that episode of The X-Files -- feeling to it. There's definitely a sense of melancholy; as if the son was unnecessarily burdened -- inappropriately so, and it's 'split' him. Again, calling back to the schizoid theme, that's very common in such pathology. We grow up very quickly, taking on more responsibility in the home than should be expected of us, and our role becomes very confused.

In short, there's a sense of over-promising what you could never hope to give, because your role has over-stepped its bounds. 

These guys really, really get it.

i believe we are inside her sons head and she is telling him that his father is ill and will pass on and she will not be able to take care of herself alone. so this song is of him making all these promises to his mother. he wants to be her rock and take her away from the pain or the death that is nearing. he wants her to feel special and loved and he wants her to know that he is ready to take responsibility, he would always put her first ad be there for her. in the video you can see he is cut i half  near  death himself  but all he wants o do is keep an eye on his mother and sing this song for her and his devotion towards her would go on even in death. that's just what i think.

@Froggyfroo MIND=BLOWN XD			

My interpretation of this song starts most obviously with the mother asking for the son to take care of her when her husband dies. And, naturally, as a son, Tyler feels obliged to do this, and promises the best for her. However, in the end, he is torn between his family and his dream, hence why in the music video he and his partner (in the band) are torn in half. We assume the partner in the band is there cause they're in this together, but, you know that's probably not entirely the case in reality. If you want to get super in detail and inference, then there's, what, a plow (?) that inferrably is what cuts them in half? What is a plow used for? Crops. GROWING. LIFE. So, I suppose we can also infer that another thing that tore him in half in his decision is the possibility of a future family, a life outside fame. And the part where he says I suppose if I sit like a bum, then finally I might be someone? This refers to the family life, one where he obviously doesn't do much, (he's probably a bit bored and depressed thinking about what he could be doing) but at least he will be something more to someone, making him a someone....  You may interpret that he is torn between himself and his dream for multiple reasons.  First, his top half is FLOATING, which means he ultimately has to make the decision. But, it quite obviously isn't that easy, its like chasing your dreams without any legs, and you know, in Tyler's case, other parts, which resembles love... (?) So, he was to decide between light (his dream), his partner, his, well, dream, verus his family, or A family. And while he has love for both, how is one to decide which is more important? And then, finally, the sun sets. The sun goes away. And the sun we may infer is his dream leaving. Hence why he collapses at the end. Him collapsing and his mother shutting the blinds tightly hints that he chose his dream, but a part of him will always stay behind.. The message seems pretty clear; either way you're gonna screw up in one way , so decide HOW you want to... or something along those lines lol. MY interpretation personally.

Although most people take ""and when your father turns to stone"" as the father dying, I take it as something different. I think the father is abusive to the mother. I think the father ""turning to stone"" is him being abusive. Stones and rocks are used as symbols of toughness and lack of emotion.""Will you buy me a house of gold"" could be her wishing for her son to give her a better life. ""And when your father turns to stone, will you take care of me"" could be translated to And when your father (beats/hurts me) will you take care of me. The mothers House of Gold is a place where her and her son could be away from their abusive husband/father. Just a theory of mine

I've felt that this song could be taken as the Virgin Mary singing to Jesus in the verse, and the chorus being Jesus singing to Mary.  ""I will make you queen on everything you see."" could be a reference to Mary becoming the queen of Heaven. She's been put on the map considering that many worshipers revere Mary.

The first stanza of the first verse talks about leaving town, having their futures turned upside down, and pretending they had a happy ending. Jesus, Mary and Joseph had to flee Nazareth, Mary's life was obviously turned upside down when she gave birth to the Son of God, and Jesus took on the form of man, but his life would not be a normal one because he had to be sacrificed for mankind. They  ""make pretend"" that they had a happy ending because to people that don't believe; Jesus was some guy that was crucified, and Mary was his mom, so they just died and that's it, it's sad.But to people of their faith, they believe that what they did has guaranteed them a spot in Heaven. Which is a happy ending. 

I'm not sure how ""father turns to stone"" line fits, and I may be completely wrong, maybe someone has an idea that stems off this?

@Tmnt530 I'm glad I'm not the only one that made this connection (even though another poster calls this idea ""of[sic] the wall"", probably ""off the wall"".)  
I agree with this interpretation, adding that ""father turns to stone"" would mean that Mary is asking Jesus to care for her after Joseph dies, which is what he did, evident at the cross when he invited the apostle John to care for her in his absence.
In my mind, all of the lyrics make sense:
""house of gold"" - heaven and the assumption of Mary,
""Queen of everything"" - coronation of Mary,
""Put you on the map"" - Mary is highly regarded throughout modern history,
""Cure you of disease"" - Mary was conceived without sin, because of her son's future work of salvation,
""I plan to be a bum..."" - Mary and Jesus both lived in poverty (ex. born in a stable) and through their poverty they are able to lead all people to God.  

There's no doubt that this is the actual intended meaning of this song - ""House of Gold"" is literally another name given to Mary by many people.  salvemariaregina.info/SalveMariaRegina/SMR-166/…

The song was written after the Beatles were going through fan mail, and they picked one out at random, which turned out to be from a school John had attended when he was young.  And, the letter said that they were analyzing the lyrics of his songs in class.  So, John wrote the nonsensical I Am The Walrus, largely based on The Walrus & The Carpenter by Lewis Carroll.  It has been said that some of the lines were written by John under the influence of LSD, but Paul had nothing to do with it.  It was John scribbling on scrap paper (I believe some of the handwritten lyrics to this song were auctioned off a couple years back).  Semolina Pilchard, by the way, was a combination of two names of nasty foods John remembers eating as a child.

it is true that the Beatles deliberately put hidden messages and meanings in their album covers and lyrics and recordings just to keep their fans frothing at the mouth.

the Beatles never took themselves seriously.  their music may have taken a serious tone by the time Sgt Pepper was done, but the Beatles never took themselves seriously as a band.  

John, for one, resented all the hype and worked feverishly toward the end of the Beatles' career (along with Yoko) to destroy any little box the media and the fans tried to put them in.

""I Am the Walrus"" was based on Carroll's ""The Walrus & The Carpenter"" as Jabbatut pointed out, but was more along the lines of Carroll's ""Jabberwocky"" in terms of nonsense.

the lyrics all have some foundation in Lennon's childhood and early adult life pre-Beatles.

the lyric about the Eggman is supposedly about Eric Burdon, of fellow Brit band the Animals (House of the Rising Sun).  Eric Burdon apparently liked to involve eggs in the bedroom, and John was taking the piss out of him.  the Eggmen would be the rest of the Animals.

and yes, tho debatable, it does sound as if there is a crowd chanting ""Smoke pot, Smoke Pot, Everybody Smoke pot"" in the background.  

also amidst the flurry of voices in the end of the song you can hear the Beatles singing the lyrics from their past hits, which is something they did quite often!

John actually wrote the song after he found out a class at an English University was started for the sole purpose of deciphering the Beatles' lyrics.

reportedly, after recording the song, Lennon smiled to producer George Martin and said, ""There, let those buggers figure that one out.""

			Alice in Wonderland also had the character Humpty Dumpty who was an egg, and who said his words mean (paraphrased) ""precisely what he meant by them, neither more nor less.""  I think Lewis Carrol was enquiring as to whether that is even possible.

That may well be the 'eggman' reference.  The singer's both the Walrus and the Egg/Man.  Not the Walrus and the Carpenter.

			Roger, I was with you all the way until the Eric Burden reference. ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"" was a Lewis Carroll poem, written in his jabberwocky style. John's interpretation of the poem was that is was a criticism of capitalism, but he incorrectly remembered the poem, thinking the Walrus was the good guy. When it was pointed out to him later, he realized that ""I Am The Carpenter"" would never have worked as a title. As for comments from other posts, there is some truth to John making fun of people finding meaning in his songs that weren't there. He did once say something about, ""If Dylan can do it, so can I."" Anyone who read either of Lennon's first two books, knows that he loved to write nonsense and make fun of the Queen's English every chance he got.			






			Alice in Wonderland also had the character Humpty Dumpty who was an egg, and who said his words mean (paraphrased) ""precisely what he meant by them, neither more nor less.""  I think Lewis Carrol was enquiring as to whether that is even possible.

That may well be the 'eggman' reference.  The singer's both the Walrus and the Egg/Man.  Not the Walrus and the Carpenter.			

			Incidentally, the chant at the end is ""everybody's got one"", and I presume it refers to genitalia - everybody has genitalia, that of which it is impolite to speak in public (was, in the 60s, at least.)  It's the kind of thing a parent in the 60s might say to reassure their child.			

			all this ridiculous nonsense about the chant at the end of the song being
""Smoke pot, Smoke pot, Everybody smoke pot"" is complete rubbish

my mum revealed to me what it was by singing along with it randomly one day
its an old childrens chant
the first two sounds are meaningless noises that if i remember correctly are ""oompa loompa"" which has no connection to roal dahl's little characters
the chant is ""oompa loompa, stick it up your jumper""
you're a bunch of idiots

It's about a parent/child relationship where the child admits that he gave his parents hell through the years, and the parents keep putting up with him. It describes my relationship with my parents too because they've never given up on me no matter what hell I put them through.

I Bet My Life"" is a song written by Ben McKee, Daniel Platzman, Dan Reynolds and Wayne Sermon of American alternative rock band Imagine Dragons. The track first appeared as a single on October 27, 2014, released as the lead single promoting their second studio album.
Lead singer Dan Reynolds has stated that the song is about his relationship with his parents and explained that while ""at times it's been strained and difficult... in the end, 'I Bet My Life' celebrates the bond that we still hold on to.

@amirbe 















I know Dan Reynolds specifically says the song is about his at times strained relationship with his parents, but to me this song can be applied much more broadly than that.  I see the Parable of the Prodigal Son is this song pretty clearly (which I suppose parallels Reynolds's own relationship with his parents to a degree).  

""I know I took the path that you would never want for me
 I know I let you down, didn't I
 So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
 But I'm just a slave unto the night

 Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
 Remember when I broke you down to tears
 I know I took the path that you would never want for me
 I gave you hell through all the years""

This verse parallels the Prodigal Son asking his father for his share of the inheritance before the father has passed (a big cultural no-no at the time) and then going off into a faraway land to squander it on riotous living.

""I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams
 Would I come running home to you
 I've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth
 There's you in everything I do""

This verse captures the conflict that the Prodigal Son must feel on some level before returning to the father.  It's humiliating, but yet his situation has become desperate enough that he has no choice.  And in that difficult return, he comes to the realization that the father is always in him.

The chorus is sung in a very different voice, and to me that means that it's a response from the father.  The father loves the son so much that he will bet his very life on him.  He's all in.  Lines up perfectly with the overall Biblical narrative.

I didn't care for the song the first time I heard it but it's growing on me.  Not as good as the best few songs from Night Visions but still a good song.

I think this song is about someone feeling as if they have treated someone terrible throughout their life, and feel bad about it now. ""I gave you hell through all the years"" says it all. Also, he/she thinks that he also done something bad since then ""I knew I took the path that you would never want for me"" also explains. I think ""So, I, I bet my life"" is about saying now I will help you, I will care for you. Dan Reynolds (main singer of Imagine Dragons) says that he thinks that he as always been the black sheep in the family, I Bet My Life, I think, is all about that.

Thanks for reading my interpretation!!

It's a religious based song. The lyrics sound like they're being spoken to god from a person who at one time turned their back on religion and now have embraced it again. Couple that with the Church Choir esc background and you've got a semi gospel styled song.

This could be what Darren Shan may have told his parents and sister when he transformed into a half human, half vampire creature. Because of his transformation, he had to leave his childhood home and fake his death. Now, he is like a slave unto the night since he bet his life to save a friend from dying from a prank he caused so he wouldn't go to jail for murder. The friend, however, doesn't believe him and vows to kill him when he grows up after he wakes up from his coma. Later on in future stories, he returns back to his hometown and maybe he'll ask them to forgive him for every stupid thing he's done.

""I go back to the smell of an old gym floor 
The taste of salt on the Carolina shore 
After graduation and drinkin goodbye to friends 
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall 
Growin up too fast and I do recall 
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks ""

""And I go back to the loss of a real good friend 
And the sixteen summers I shared with him 
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks

Drivin my first love out to the levvy
Livin life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks""

reminds me so much of my high school life, sitting there at football games with my now fiancee wrapped in a blanket even though he was out of school, and although I know he is singing about church choir, that line kinda gets me a bit too, as choir was one of the main parts of my high school life.  Although I certinally have funny memeories of sitting there at church with one of my best friends having writen conversations on bulitians, silently giggling over some guy or class or the pastors ear hair LOL.  I still miss high school like crazy and cry almost every time I hear this song, especially with the music video, it really makes me think of the times I spent with friends back in HS (class of 2003 baby!).  I also love how he incorporates how songs take you back, I've always been that way with songs, but music has always been my life.

This song is about a lost love. He writes of the degree to which he knew this girl. They were so in love and so close, but time faded their love. Eventually time took her away from him. This song has a mellow tone to it, that reminds many listeners of lost love and broken hearts. He is almost mesmerized at the power time had on them. He keeps saying how well he knew her and how tightly he held onto her, but time still managed to rip them apart.

He knew her in the way in that his soul recognized her soul.

From what my mom said to me, this song is supposed to signify the memories he had from his childhood with his family, and what made him who he is today. You learn to love what you have or had until you grow up. Many can have memories with their family, others from high school, or practically anything that comes to mind. And in this case, it is quite clear that Blake had memories with his father, uncle and grandparents. When he says these lyrics 

“Takin’ my mind on a visit/
Back in time ‘cause I miss it/
You would’nt learn to love it/ 
Like I love it unless you live it/
And man, I lived it/“

he’s telling you that he can only experienc his childhood via the memories that circulate in his mind, and you would’nt learn to love said memories unless you’ve lived it just like he did, which adds to the feeling of this song altogether.

This song is about needing someone and always going to them when things don't go right.

			One of those rare cases where the videoclip represents something about the song			






			One of those rare cases where the videoclip represents something about the song			

The mood changes as the song goes on - it's quite clever really.  The first two verses (""I want to break free"", ""I've fallen in love"") are very strong, positive and defiant in the desire to get out of whatever it is (a relationship, I think) that's gone wrong.  There's nothing he wants more than to break free (""I've got to break free"").

The ""It's strange, but it's true"" bit always threw me, but I think it's sung to the person he's fallen in love.  The doubts are setting in now: ""But I have to be sure, when I walk out that door"" - does he really want to break free?  Does he love this person enough to leave whoever he's with at the moment?  Can he break free?

By the last verse, he's done it - he's left her/it/whatever.  And now he's done it, he realises how much he needed her/it - ""I can't get used to living without you/I don't want to live alone"".  The person he's left has such a hold on him that, although he knows he's got to complete the break, he can barely bring himself to do it.  

And the last line, ""So baby can't you see, I've got break free"", re-enforces that: he hasn't broken free yet, not really.  She's still got that hold on him so that he's truly not free.

Like I say, it's a bit more ambiguous than the title might suggest and it's a cracker of a song.

@stejsmith 















Amazing song from an amazing band.

I interpretate it the following way:

'I want to break free'. 
He's moaning about the person he's with, and that he wants to break free from the persons  lies. As the song progresses, I interpretate this verse as some kind of excuse for how he truly feels: he says he want to get rid of the person he's with, but secretly he doesn't want that at all. That what a lot of people do: it's called putting up a brave face!

'I've fallen in love'.
This verse shows what his true feelings are. He is in love with someone and he's convinced that it's real. 

'It's strange but it's true'
He's kind of doubting wether he wants to break free or not: It's strange but he can't seem to get over the way how this person loves him. But, he continues to give himself power by saying that 'he wants to break free, he wants to break free'. 

'But life still goes on'
He has broken up with the person, and as everyone always says: life goes on. But he can't get used to living without this love. Now he wants to break free from the feelings of wanting the person back, but deep down he just wants to be with the person. 

At least, that's my interpretation, I tried! ;)

			yeah - that would be the most straightforward interpretation - mercury, deacon - they were WAY BEYOND face value though (IMO) - lyricists that riddled their works with parallels and metaphors from all aspects of life, love and the world			

I think this is one of those songs that can be interpreted in lots of different ways. I love songs like this that can identify with so many people that need to identify with a song. For me the way I interpreted ""I want to break free"" is partly explored in the way it is used in the we will rock you musical. Wanting to break free from a a world that is just so false and corrupt and untrustworthy and evil, etc. And also I can identify with I want to break free, in terms of wanting to break free from my life the way and break free and change it and myself. This is one of my favoruite songs, based on the fact that it a brilliantly written song but also because the lyrics are so powerful. Songs like bohemian rhapsody are such amazing songs and so creative and imaginative. But I find that I connect more personally to the lyrics in songs like ""I want to break free"".

However he is scared of this change of not being there for her and does not think he can make it on his own

@dasfuhrer 















I've pondered the meaning of this song for 25 years--it has a deep personal meaning to me, and has always left me perplexed, because a guy that I was dating & deeply in love with dedicated the song to me at a bar one night. Our relationship was young, but we felt the same way about each other--in fact, he had professed deep love for me on our second date, despite being on the heels of a recent break-up.I honestly didn't know what the song meant, or what he meant by dedicating it to me As I think about it all these years later, I can't help but think that the song conveys a man's feelings of wanting to 'break free' from one relationship to pursue a new one; leave a relationship where his feeling have not exactly been returned, yet he was afraid of walking out that door & being alone if things don't work out.. His insecurities have kept him trapped in one relationship, and a bit hesitant to pursue a new one as he says ""you're so self satisfied, I don't need you."" He seems truly overwhelmed by his new lover, whom he proclaims to be his first true love (as my boyfriend did me), & saying "" I can't get over the way you love me like you do."" My boyfriend felt this way also--I accepted & loved him unconditionally, not just in spite of his flaws, but because of them--they made him who he was. So I think he was scared by these feelings, that someone could love him wholly & unconditionally. He ultimately does break free, immersed in a new relationship, but seems to express some remorse at the end of the song--perhaps leaving a long-term relationship for someone new, he felt apologetic, explaining why he had to break free & still a tad unsteady without her familiarity by his side. That's the best meaning I've come up with after years of thinking about that night in the bar! I suppose I could have asked him what he meant by playing it for me & never once questioned this!

Despite most people thinking that this song was written by Freddie about him being gay,  the song was actually written by John Deacon and in my opinion I think it was kinda inspired by the fact that John's seen as the quiet one but he'd love to 'break free' or it could mean that he wants to end a relationship but feels he can't because he 'can't get used to living without' the person in particular, so there you go, I've given you plenty of points to comment on now so write a comment because I can't believe only2 people have commented on such a great song.

542,I'm A Thug.json,"
its been a long long time, since i lost myself 
put my pride down on the table, put my fear on the shelf 
so i bought myself a thrown to reside and let myself go 
but ive travelled much too far, where ive gone i'll never know 

(chorus) 
what a long, long time 
long, long time 
It's been a little old while since i felt so fine 
wanderin' in the rain 
losing my mind 
what a long, long time x2 

my days i've spent relaxing turned to nights relaxin' too 
a thousand eyes upon me, but my sights are missing you 
so this time i swear i will loosen my grip 
on past times, and bad lines, and meaningless trips. 

chorus 

so, over and over mile signs pass by my side 
the more you try to find yourself the more you tend to hide 
behind these forest trees and greens that blind your eyes 
to lounge upon that thrown i bought, 
confer there with the wise 

chorus 

so here we appear, the rest lost themselves in a pit of fear 
for who? what can i do? but let them all come through the wall 
and though some oppose many of these things i know 
i'll stay here alone, and lose myself on the riverways of days 
i'm coming home.

			This song actually came from the result of a lot of alcohol one night in the ocean. Kenny supposedly looked at his boat Captain the next morning and asked if he was ok.... the reply was ""I'm alive.""

Great song and pretty self explanatory, but funny when you know how it came about.

He found that her girlfriend (or boyfriend) cheated on him, but though, he still need her/him around. It's a very sad song, because it shows how hard it is to find out something like that and not to be able to shut down your emotions and get over it soon.

I really like the song, but don't quite get the lyrics. i don't understand when he sings: You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done

Why would she call him crazy? He hasn't accused her of anything. If he had said, ""You're cheating on me"" yes, then she could say, ""you're crazy."" But he hasn't made any accusations. I thought the video was odd because here's a guy singing in the first person but about a third person, the woman. Why didn't he sing about himself being cheated on? In Adele's Someone Like You, she sings in the first person and she's acting out the song from her perspective.

Or maybe the bs she's doing is basically treating him like he must be crazy, bc she doesn't think he'll find out.

My opinion on this song is that the person whom he was with did him wrong cheating ,or what have you, and apparently was confronted about it...but when asked the response was ""You crazy"" as if to say I didn't do anything like that, you are tripping,  when the singer is saying you are saying that ONLY because ""you don't think I know what you've done"" and ""when you call me baby...I know I'm not the only one"" is because you are calling another person the same thing. To sum it up the cheater got caught and tried to deny it by making the accuser look crazy.

I have been through exactly the same dysfunctional, self sacrificing Gay relationship as Sam has here. It Sux! Clearly he has felt the pain and degradation at the hands of his emotional manipulater too. Like Christian Grey, a lover incapable of giving his heart hasn't hesitated to take Sam's trust and love to feed his own narcissistic personality, cheated, and worst of all, lied and denied it, making Sam feel wrong! But he was right and denied himself his instinctual truth, further damaging himself by not asserting!

“I’m not the only one” - by Sam Smith 
          My opinion in “I’m not the only one” by Sam Smith is that he is relating this song to people who have experienced what it’s like and how it feels to be cheated on. Cheating is a daily occurrence in society today and you can’t really relate to it unless you yourself have experienced it. The emotions and heartache that follow cheating are almost what feels like impossible to overcome. Sam Smith uses parts of his songs to describe what it feels like such as the line “I have loved you for many years, Maybe I am just not enough, You've made me realize my deepest fear, By lying and tearing us up.” That line is describing how that being cheated on makes you feel like you were never worth it enough to be loyal too. You finally realize that the person you've loved for such a long time has been lying to you and never thought you deserved to know the truth. The tone of the song Sam Smith sings in is a complete somber desperate tone. The beat of the song and the way he sings it, it automatically screams heartbreak. His voice sings in such tragedy that you can almost feel how upset he is and how much pain he is in. Sam Smith also sings in such a way that you can almost predict how his song is playing out. Along with the music video he made, you have a pretty good idea of the imagery his song is creating. When he says “For months on end I've had my doubts, Denying every tear..” You can almost envision tears streaming down his face as he sings the song. It helps you get a good feel of how he truly feels. Overall his song hits deep with many people who have gone through exactly what he’s singing about which is why it’s been a huge hit. Sam Smith did an excellent putting his feelings and words into a song and making it feel like a reality. His points are very clear that cheating hurts and you shouldn't ever do it to someone that loves you.

His ex-girlfriend discovered that he is gay (he revealed this in May of 2014 to the public) and maybe cheated on him because he kept that secret from her (""You say I'm crazy""). Back in the 1960s and earlier, gay people were considered crazy, and she must have been a conservative type.

@seeing 















I personally believe that “I’m Not The Only One” by Sam Smith has to do with people breaking up from awful experiences they go through and having to be hurt all of the time. The first key idea would be a couple where one of them is being cheated on; So in the 3rd and 4th line the speaker wrote, “I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in a way it hurts” to let one know that the speaker has never been disappointed from the love of his/her life and ever since he/she confessed, their world has just been horrible and hurt. Another lyric from this song the speaker wrote about the person finding out he/she has been cheated on is “You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why”.  The second key idea would be the lover being hurt all of the time. The speaker wrote “For months on end I've had my doubts Denying every tear I wish this would be over now But I know that I still need you here”, indicating that he/she is hurt and feeling sad and hopes that from being cheated on and being left alone all of the time will end soon. The Third key idea from this song would be where the lover being cheated on, tries to have revenge. The speaker wrote “I have loved you for many years Maybe I am just not enough You've made me realize my deepest fear By lying and tearing us up You say I'm crazy 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done”, telling us that he/she have had enough of the relationship, so he/she tries to find ways to have revenge on him/her by changing their aspects of life even though the lover knows that he/she is crazy to be with the love of his/her life.

I personally believe that “I’m Not The Only One” by Sam Smith has to do with people breaking up from awful experiences they go through and having to be hurt all of the time. The speaker expresses his feelings and life aspects, using a couple as an example to make the listener understand through the song.
As one begins to go through the song, it immediately gets the attention of people from the speaker that can easily be understood and feel the aspects the speaker is going through. The first key idea would be a couple where one of them is being cheated on; So in the 3rd and 4th line the speaker wrote, “I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in a way it hurts” to let one know that the speaker has never been disappointed from the love of his/her life and ever since he/she confessed, their world has just been horrible and hurt. Another lyric from this song the speaker wrote about the person finding out he/she has been cheated on is “You've been so unavailable

The second key idea would be the lover being hurt all of the time. The speaker wrote “For months on end I've had my doubts Denying every tear I wish this would be over now But I know that I still need you here”, indicating that he/she is hurt and feeling sad and hopes that from being cheated on and being left alone all of the time will end soon. This could also possibly mean that the speaker was often hurt like when he wrote “Denying every tear”, meaning that the “tear” is a symbol of being hurt from the past events that he/she would deny.
The Third key idea from this song would be where the lover being cheated on, tries to have revenge. The speaker wrote “I have loved you for many years Maybe I am just not enough You've made me realize my deepest fear By lying and tearing us up You say I'm crazy 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done”, telling us that he/she have had enough of the relationship, so he/she tries to find ways to have revenge on him/her by changing their aspects of life even though the lover knows that he/she is crazy to be with the love of his/her life.   
The speaker’s ending seems that this couple could possibly end up being back to the way it was from a little hope, or could possibly mean to just end things for once before the after life. The speaker clearly states his feelings and hopes towards the end of the song.

@mjp2694 















Speaking from experience I can tell you that this song is simply about betrayal and how painful it is to live with the knowledge that your significant other yearns for another.  No secret is ever such and when the truth is revealed it is so agonizingly painful.  Being betrayed by the love of your life is so hard to recover from, especially if their charade continues and they have no intention of letting up. Being in love with someone who’s betrayed you and continues to do so regardless of your feeling slowly destroys your mind and soul.  You begin to blame yourself and wonder how you had failed.  A betrayer will try to tell you that you are crazy and that it’s all in your head – that YOU are imagining things.  They will tell you what you want to hear to appease you, all the while they are only biding their time until they can talk or be with their lover. With their secret exposed, they will turn it all around on you and blame you for their transgressions.  They will blatantly lie right to your face to appease their own selfish needs. You soon become numb and try to push the thoughts and memories into the dark recesses of your mind. It is easily one of the worst feeling when you are held hostage by your heart for you will soon become a hopeful fool with the hopes that someday, perhaps tomorrow, that it will all be over – that they will come to their senses and that their heart will truly be yours… but that tomorrow may never come. In a nutshell, that’s what this song is all about.

I think this song is mainly about a kid that grew up with divorced parents and it was truly tough for him. He soon finds out he's getting a stepfather and he gets all upset about it so he does everything he can to make the man change his mind but the guy doesn't change his mind so the kid gets uspsetan ales it out on them tepfathr for all of his stupidness. And the stepfather allows it. And when the kid is grown up he reaizes how stupid he was and blames himself.

@Deathrose 















I think the title ""I'm So Sorry"" is kind of a sarcastic name for the song. This song (in my opinion) is about someone who thinks he/she has been pushed around, has gone with the crowd, and never had his/her opinion expressed to someone before. I think the person is acknowledging that now, and trying to change that about him/her. ""So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go, you'll never be loved till you've made it your own"" basically describes the whole song, and what I've explained so far. 
Thanks for reading my comment!
Hope you like it!

Be interesting to know if they still live in the ghetto and when they have children if they want them growing up in a similar environment ...

This song I'm the One by DJ Khaled feat. Justin Bieber, Quavo, Chance the Rapper seems fairly straightforward. It appears to be a music story of a man telling a woman that he is the one for her, yet it seems to be more or less a confirmation of the way he feels about her as from the song's lyrics the romantic attraction seems to be mutual. It is actually a fun summer song.

The idea that this is about some chick he's in love with is just the surface meaning. What this is really all about is drugs, and specifically, injected drugs such as heroin. 

""I've got you under my skin"". Does it have to be spelled out?

""I would sacrifice anything"" - we know that addicts will stop at nothing to get their fix.

""wake up to reality"" - under the influence of the drug, he is detached from reality.

""So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me"" - the addict is so far gone that he identifies with the substance.

Just all so obvious, really.

Most of the meanings I see are about Frank Sinatra.  The song was not written by Frank Sinatra, it was written by Cole Porter (and, yes, he had his own demons to deal with).  However, the song has been sung by many both male and female singers.  I think a very important word is ""affair"".  I think this is a torch song sung by someone in an intense affair with a partner who is committed elsewhere (to a family, a career) hence ""little fool (singing to him/her self) you never can win"".  Wake up to the reality that you are never going to get the relationship your heart aches for.

552,I've Told You Now.json,"
I think his feelings have been said to someone who struggles with hearing them and who is incredibly insecure. The person already knows what he is going to say but is not satisfied unless those things are said out loud, and he refuses. It's a waste of his time if he keeps talking and he's still not heard. Why do you think I come round here wasting all my precious time.... Because I want you. You know me well enough so I'm not going to explain. But that other person is starving to hear his words...like walking in the heat all day without water... Missing that connection... Like watching friends connect and not connecting with yours... Losing an argument because though you're right, you can't get your words in order. That person deep down knows he's there but just can't get themselves in order enough to believe it. He believes his person should know him well enough not to keep having to explain himself. He is there and that should be enough.

Maybe he’s telling a story of the day he confessed his feelings. He’s frustrated from “walking in the heat all day with no water”, then waiting for a long time for the friend to show up, then getting into an argument and he can’t express why he’s mad. Maybe the friend is taking him and what he does for granted. He’s been tip toeing around the subject of love for this friend, but now, the levee has broken and it all comes out. This is a literal translation of the song, I know :)

553,Ice and Rain.json,"
I think this song is pretty simple to get. It's about a girl from the suburbs who fell for a bad guy the whole good girls like bad guys thing comes into play. Then she starts to realize that he's not the right one for her. She wakes up sad and crying all the time but she's still ignorant enough to think she could save this relationship that has no chance. She see's that her dreams are only sidestepped by his dream of making money and she's not really a priority and her mother won't take her back because she ran out on them so she's basically stuck. In the last verse she finally has the courage to just up and leave him and instead she realizes her man ran into some trouble and owes money. So instead paying them he tells the people he owes to go get his girl instead. (""We called your man he knew just what it is, we told him no dough then we go and get your bitch""). Knowing she's going to die she doesn't care anymore cause her man had ruined her so much she feel death is the best way to escape the pain is death.""He killed me when he made me, tell him I been dead"" It was him that killed her spiritually and that way worse than any physical death she's going to experience by that handgun they got aimed at her.
""So tell him I been dead he killed me when he made me"" Basically meaning the day she met him was the day the person she used to be died already.

An amazing inspiring song that Elvis sang with more emotiona than almost any other song.  

Elvis cared deeply about people and treating each other with dignity and equality, he had a few songs like this where he sings about social issues like ""In the ghetto""  But ""If I can dream"" is about the dream of everyone getting along, no fighting about stupid issies, etc.  And might be a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. now that I think about it and his hope that peace was possible between people.  It's a song of hope, ""But as long as a man Has the strength to dreamHe can redeem his soul and fly""

The raw emotion in this song is really powerful, sung from the heart and it shows.
At the 2010 Parkes Elvis Festival a finalist in the Elvis impersonation contest chose this song to sing - unfortunately for him he couldn't get near the vocal and emotional intensity of Elvis.

i think it's about him not knowing people as well as he thought he did, and looking back he knows that if he'd know as much about them then as he does now, he would've loved them so much more.
it's a really adorable song and it's really relatable[:

As someone who has suffered from anxiety and depression for her entire adult life, listening to “In My Blood” is truly inspiring. What a beautiful and chilling peek into the life of someone suffering with one of these disorders. While they obviously do not manifest universally in the same ways, it is always eye-opening to hear the way someone else experiences them. With all of the stigma surrounding mental health, it is refreshing to hear a star talk about his own experiences and gift us such a vivid portrait of his emotions.

You can even hear how he experiences these emotions through the tone of the song. Beginning on a somber note, we hear Shawn Mendes open with a quiet plea for help. This is followed by the confession that he sometimes feels like giving up, an unfortunately frequent experience for those who suffer from depression. Suddenly, the meek voice that we’ve been hearing is disrupted by an impassioned battle cry. “It isn’t in my blood!” He cries out loudly (probably for his own benefit just as much as ours). I hope that everyone, even those not suffering from these disorders, finds some solace in this passion -- something deep down inside that helps them to keep going. I know that he inspired that in me.

Shawn Mendes has commented that this song is about his struggle with anxiety, since becoming famous.

In my opinion, I interpret the song as him expressing his experience in words when he's anxious, but choosing to dig deep from within to fight through it. Instead of masking the issue or temporarily ""fixing"" it by using alcohol or sex, he's choosing to be stronger than that.

I love this song and I totally agree with Kim10 and ReonataO! I mean y’all covered it and all I can add as a Mother of the most awesome 16 year old Son who suffers from Depression, Anxiety, Stress, Anger, and his counselor said he suffers from PTSD from My Mother’s Passing. She helped me so much when I needed her so I paid her to watch him when I started working. Long story short She was like another Mother to him cause he started staying with my Mom during work starting  at 2 months old and we held her till she passed and it was rough! He has now gotten so introverted and a loner that is dealing with exactly what this song says and means! I heard it and instantly fell it. I apologize for this isn’t about my life it’s my opinion guess I just needed to get that out! It wasn’t a good day......Thank you for reading if you made it through my book....;-) Gotta keep on keeping on....

@Torries 















In this song ""In My Blood"", it is about dealing with anxiety and other various factors in your life. Whether it be school, health related, drama, relationships, etc. Shawn has found a way to express we can get through the hardships. 

I have anxiety factors in my life, and when he says ""Its like the walls are caving in"", it related to everything crumbling. Even though your world may be coming down, it can be rebuilt one way or another. Then the lyrics ""I need somebody now"" go into we all need to help work with each other. We need someone to help out and its important to have people who care about you in your life. ""Im overwhelmed and insecure give me something"" is the most powerful lyric. We shouldn't use drugs or alcohol or other substances to get over the bumps in our lives. Overall, has been my inspiration as a true human being. Love you Shawn!

565,In My Life.json,"
First of all, I'd like to say that I don't truly think anyone's really given this particular song a justified response, as to what the song is actually supposed to mean.  Sure, some people give very surface-level statements about what it means, but nothing deep -- and it's a deep song, as Lennon said.  Most of the comments involve the poster's life, and how the song has affected them, rather than what the song actually means.  Hence, I'd like to actually put some attention in the song, where it belongs.

In its entirety, the song is basically written to someone beloved to the songwriter.  The speaker is expressing their love for someone special.  This is indicated by the line ""In my life I love you more.""  Although, rather than simply saying, ""I love you,"" the writer decides to compare their newfound love to everything they've known to love and cherish their entire life.  This is indicated by the lines, ""And these memories lose their meaning/  /When I think of love as something new.""  Hence, the writer is saying, ""Compared to even the most cherished of all of my life's memories, I love you more.""  

Hence, the song isn't necessarily about reminiscing or nostalgia.  Instead, it's more about expressing one's love for someone, by comparing them to the past.  ""You're greater than my most cherished and fond memories.""  Although, in doing so, the writer must express how great and cherished these memories actually are.  Hence, there is a sense of nostalgia and reminiscing, in order to express the depth of this love and appreciation for the past.  And so, by showing how deeply in love he/she is with their past, the writer is truly saying miles, by comparing their love to these feelings.  They are, in essence, saying that they respect and appreciate their past indefinitely, but that even those memories cannot surpass the love he/she now feels for this new special person.  And so, they express the immensity and seriousness of their love for that person.  

Although, the average person will only really relate to the nostalgia and reminiscing, so that the song isn't really cherished as a love song.  Instead, oddly, it's cherished as a looking-back song.  A song of memory.  A song of reflecting on the past.  And it's odd how the chord structure of the music, and every selected note, seems to get across a sad, somber feeling, rather than some excitement and seriousness of an expression of love.  Instead of a love song, it comes across more as a melancholy perspective of the past; a deep, sad look at all of the memories of one's life.  

And personally, I think the beat is too Beatlesque.  In other words, it's too poppy.  Too upbeat.  Too rock and roll.  John Lennon's later music was very serious and deep -- expressing worlds of emotion, as he had matured as an independent songwriter/musician.  I think it's sad that John Lennon didn't re-record this particular song in his later years.  It was truly one of his all-time best songs, along with Imagine.  And also, I feel the same way about Help.  I think Help should have been re-recorded, along with Strawberry Fields Forever.  While Strawberry is simply odd-sounding, and could've been orchestrated better, Help suffers from the same problems as In My Life: the beat is too poppy, too upbeat, too Beatlesque.  The odd thing is, these aren't Beatle songs; their Lennon songs.  One can sense Lennon's particular style all over these songs.  The very lyrics are philosophically deep and moving -- full of meaning and emotion, whereas most Beatle songs are simply catchy, without the extra sense of meaning, for which Lennon was no doubt talented.  

I think McCartney's Yesterday was a good example of how these Lennon songs should've been recorded.  Solo piano, or solo guitar, without the rest of the band, and without the drums.  Lennon's songs were simply too bare and special to involve the rest of the Beatles.  He should have recorded In My Life, Help, and Strawberry Fields Forever in a very personal, solo manner.  I think the songs are now left in a form which isn't truly genuine to Lennon.  I feel they are songs suck in the past, in a form Lennon could have done away with.  I feel Lennon's true mature song writing style would've naturally brought out the true depth and scope of these earlier songs.  And now they're simply stuck in a two-dimensional Beatlesque box of pop garbage.  But I still think they are decent, even if they aren't exactly entirely Lennonesque.   Lennon's spirit still lies within the music -- one just has to overlook all of that Beatly nonsense to hear it!  

Cheers.

@richard155 I agree that  he lost it there. This is not a solo Lennon song but a Beatles song. The Beatles consist of John Lennon,Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.Not John Lennon alone. Despite the fact that John did not re-record this song on his own, it remains a great song. Who knows if Lennon lived beyond the age of 40? He could have had a better interpretation of the song. But unfortunately when the Beatles broke up, all members are trying to create their own brand of music particularly in the 70's and they refrained from singing Beatle songs. Then decades have past,then the surviving members of the Beatles started to sing Beatle songs in their concerts once again during the 90's. Too bad that we would not know what the solo version of John of this song would have been better when the Beatles recorded it as he did not live beyond his sudden death in 1980. BUT NO ONE CAN TAKE THE OUT THE FACT THAT IT REMAINS A GREAT SONG. If Lennon lived, I doubt that he would have surpassed the success of the Beatles. Even McCartney who still is alive today didn't despite the fact that he had a great solo career.

This song is the ultimate lookin back, reflecting, mistakes and triumphs, loves and losses, missing your old friends, loving the new ones song! It was played on the Wonder Years a few times, along with many other Beatles songs. The best part about this song, is it all come back to one person ""but of all these friends and lovers....there is no one compares with you"", it all centers around true love, that one person that means more than all the others...in your life.				
				







 
There was an error.





@Cherriepie 















most people think, as i once did, that these lyrics are simply a ""nostalgia trip"" but if you get beyond the first verse, it is fairly plain to see that John's mentioning of old friends and nostalgic moments serves merely as a means to express his love through comparison; ""But of all these friends and lovers / There is no one compares with you / And these memories lose their meaning /When I think of love as something new.""  In the next ""stanza,"" if you will, or the second bridge to be precise,  he goes on to say that even though he loves those memories so much that he'll ""never lose affection"" for them, he will actually ""love you more,"" whoever ""you"" happens to be.  What it basically comes down to is that this is a love song that compares one's romantic love for another with his nostalgic love for his memories... and as we all know, the latter is a very powerful emotion, hence the magnitude of the implication that the subject in the lyrics loves his woman more than his nostalgic memories.  

had this been a different day, i might have considered arguing against the idea that these lyrics have ""hidden"" drug meanings.... but such an idea is so ridiculous that it really doesn't merit more than the brief mentioning it just received.

I recently split from my girlfriend, who i believed was my true love, it really hurt and this song reflects the way i feel about her, and life, and often makes me cry listening to it.  i don't think ive known a song with so much meaning.

No other song can describe the feeling of love as perfectly as this one.  It's easy to relate to simply because of the fact that if you've ever been in love, you have certainly lost sleep over the fact on whether or not you should tell her your feelings.

I think this is one of the best love songs ever written.

I agree with JASGripen's comments about Into My Arms' first stanza transforming intervention into something bad.

krburg and productofthe80s, please compare the lyrics of West Country Girl, Black Hair and Green Eyes (which are definatly about P.J.) to Into My Arms.  All songs are off the same album (The Boatman's Call) and presumably written around the same time.  The Boatman's Call is Nick cave's ""breakup album"" and I don't think this song is about anyone in particular, but if itwas, I doubt it would be P.J.

Also, I don't understand where the comments about the lyrics being ""a little corrupt"" or about ""a corrupted man being humbled by love"" are coming from.  This is simply a love song no more, no less.  It is not aout either platonic love or perfection, all though the theme of perfection is present from Nick's idolisation and romanticisation of the woman as being angelic.

@Dressed2Depress 















Hmm... I think you are all maybe seeking something what does not exist. But It is not a mistake, sometimes I do so, but I think there is'not better explanation to this song that Nick has simply written some very, very specific and wonderful prayer. And he says simply, that we can love each other ( you and your beloved one ) despite being different, having different believs, different colou of skin and whatever. A music video of this song proofs this too. And maybe - another aspect that you've mentioned - the platonic love. I see it there too, because Nick Cave speaks here of love in most divine form, mos saint and ( from my own expriencis ) this kind of love in this highest point, as I can say, cleans out all other ""human"" aspect of love... maybe... but as well as this maybe not... it depends of you, how you will explain it... ;-)

wow..i think it must just be me but i cant help but think this song is about death. i guess in a way it is a love song.. but to me about a dead person. its almost as if the persona, who had never previously belived in god, is asking him to look after that person who has passed, is pleading to leave that person exactly as they are, and is almost asking that in the chance that the loved one needs to be directed to another place, that it one day be back into the persona's arms. Its interesting that i feel that interpretation from that song, seeing as even though i believe in some kind of higher presence, i wouldnt consider myself religious. I dont know i guess if i died i would want my special someone to think of me in this way.

To me I think this song is simply about that ""special someone"" who is perfect as he or she is and not wanting them to ever encounter harm. Hence the lyrics 

""I would kneel down and ask him
Not to intervene when it came to you
Oh, not to touch a hair on your head
Leave you as you are""

""But if I did I would summon them together
Ask them to watch over you
Oh, to each burn a candle for you
To make bright and clear your path""

Here's what this song means.

This is about someone who is lost in the mix of everything. ""Football on the TV."" He's become subject to the 21st century. He has no friends, or life. He is lost and doesn't even know who he is anymore. Throughout the song, he is trying to become someone and do things. But in the end he resolves to ""it's too late, I can't escape"" meaning that he's wasted too much of his life and must go back to the same old same old.


This song is a pretty remarkable song. Both in how he presents it and lyrically. I honestly thought they where a ""shitty"" boyband until their new album came along. If you still think they're a boyband, they're not. I'm a guy who generally prefers Radiohead, Beck, Bowie, and the Grateful Dead. But these guys really aren't that bad. They're not 1D and are turning into more of a Green Day.

This song has been talked about by fans for a while now. Trying to figure out the meaning. It can be taen in different ways. Personaly, this is what I believe. It starts with the sound of type writers. The person is writing a note. ""Another day, of painted and football on the TV. No one sees me"" The person feels unwanted/needed by the people close to them. ""Lost inside a memory of someone's life. It wasn't mine"" They are thinking back on the few good times they've had. They are leaving/have already left. ""Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets"" They are alone, thinking back to every mistake made. They feel ""Invisible to the people around them. As the song progresses, it repeats ""Who am I? Invisible."" They feel like no one is there or sees them. The music builds toward the end. Almost like a climax of a story. It gets louder and more intense, as Calum sings harsher and more emotionally attached. The scratchiness of his voice shows fear. The music represents the persons emotions. Scared, afraid of what is happening. Then, suddenly, it all stops, going back to a single acoustic guitar and type writer, signaling the story for this person is almost over. Everything is suddenly calm and okay. I think this means the person has left. (died) ""Another day
The walls are built to keep me safe, I can't escape
It's too late"" Its too late. They are already gone. It cuts off like that and goes to a symphony. Whats weird is this is a song written in a major chord, but ends on a minor note. Just stops and ends. Kind of like what happens in life. It just....stops.

"
577,Isle of Flightless Birds.json,"
In this song, Tyler is crying out for help, because he has these wings, but they have no purpose because he can't fly. What that is really saying is that, he realizes that he has talents blessed to him by God, that aren't being used worthwhile, because he isn't using them for God. 

Tyler then realizes that all that he and humanity are doing on their own is useless, and making their depression worse. Relying on yourself instead of God, and living by what YOU think is wrong and right, will ultimately ruin you. Then he goes on to say; ""If we wake up every morning, and decide what we believe, we can take apart our very heart and the life will set us free."" I believe this is saying that, if we take the time to deeply consider who or what we believe in, then we will have new life under be it Jesus or whatever you find to be the truth. 

Tyler then goes on to talk about the grace of God, because here on Earth, we are caught up in our own selves, wasting his time and ignoring what his will for us is. But he is waiting patiently, for us to realize that we can't and aren't doing this on our own. While we're down here, doing the same daily routine. Tyler then encourages you to not be afraid and push away Jesus knocking at your soul, wanting to enter in and give you new life. Because it's time you find your purpose, and he promises you that this is his.

These are all my opinions, feel free to read into the lyrics and come by your own meaning. Because Tyler's songs can interpreted in so many different ways.

@22ndPilot I happen to disagree, Tyler was raised in a Christian household, but many of his lyrical masterpieces are very agnostic. One example of such is Implicit demand for proof. 

But if your idea of the song is true one thing kinda taunts that theory in this line:
And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle, and I promise you this is mine

He is choosing against doing the will of ""God"" so to speak.

Although this line does support the theory of yours:
But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe
We can take a part our very heart and the light will set us free

I personally don't believe in the Christian god, but hey what can I say.

@luglige117 I see what you mean, for sure man. However, in that specific example I truly believe Tyler is demonstrating the times in a Christian's life when they may under-go a time of true questioning within themselves, wondering if God really even is real. The way he describes it makes me think that the perspective would be after you have suffered some sort of heartbreak, whether it be a death of someone close or just something really unfortunate happens in your life in which you almost blame God and take on a negative view of him afterwards, as almost a form of coping. While I may understand that those songs may depict agnostic viewpoints, these would relate most to the christian and his walk with God.

In the lines that you mentioned, I have taken it an entirely different way. When man fell in the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The eating of this forbidden fruit signified man's defilement and disobedience of God, and in turn transformed us from inherently good and blissfully ignorant to evil, to a people that experience and understand the difference between the two. I believe that this is what Tyler is referring to in these lines. He's telling people not to ignore their conscience and how they may feel deep down inside, and to truly examine yourself and how you're living.

Also, the third line there is not connected to the idea of the previous two lines. Notice how within the context of the verse:
Please think about why you can't sleep in the evening
*AND* please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
*AND* it's time you pick your battle, and I promise you this is mine

The things that he is suggesting to people are separated by the ""and's"". The battle that he tells us to pick is referring to our ministry and God's will for our life, fighting the good fight. The battle that Tyler chose is his music career, helping and encouraging people with depression and uplifting the lives of the broken and directing them to find the deeper meaning within their lives, like Jesus dying on the cross for our sins, which is the will that God has for his life. God has a will for all of our lives, and he wants very different things for all of us, so it's time for us to stop messing around and to pick our battle.

This just my two cents, I appreciate the reply, very good discussion. If you have anything else to say I'm all ears!

Listening to this song I thought a lot about the struggle of a young man whose family is stuck in a bad financial situation. There's more than one voice in the lyrics, that being the first flightless bird crying out to the demons and angels, and a close one of that bird who sees what the flightless bird sees but does not have the strength and courage to attempt flight like the first bird does.

""Now is the climax to the story
that gives the demons and angels purpose""
The intro could be being sung by either a third voice, a narrator, or possibly the second bird, who could be the narrator.
The angels and demons are made up of the super-elite. Actors, the 1%, those who don't have to deal with the struggle of a family living in a ghetto. The story could be thought of as the containment and leash that big business and wall street have on the flightless birds. The way they thrive in the sky is through the misfortune of the flightless birds (not to say that they all purposefully force the flightless birds to suffer, but they would not be as high up if the flightless birds could fly. This is the climax because the first flightless bird is going to attempt to fly, to get off the ground and get out of his ghetto, thus ending his story of being confined to the ground.

""I am cold, can you hear
I will fly with no hope no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I...sing""
Just like any young person trying to lead a better life than their unfortunate parents, the flightless bird is afraid, courageous, brave, and hopeless all at once. Confused and seemingly alone, he struggles to lift off of the ground and fly.

I don't think the first verse is sung by the second voice, only because in my interpretation, the second bird hasn't yet attempted to fly, but is only being inspired to fly by the first bird. The first bird sings the first verse, because they know what the pain is like to attempt to fly, or break the leash they are restrained by.

""All we are is an isle of flightless birds
we find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're finding our homes again winding roads
and we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing, remind us of things
that nobody cares about
And honestly we're probably 
more suicidal than ever now""
This is the flightless bird singing about his situation, the way his people distract themselves and his unsustainable position.

""If you decide to live by
what you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry""
The painful thing for the flightless bird is more than just the ghetto he lives in, but also the pain of his own morality that extends to what he sees as the evil of the flying birds. It's the pain of being blinded by the light that is his possible salvation, mixed with the horror of the impossible odds he, and the rest of the flightless birds, are given.

""But if we wake up every morning
and decide what we believe
we can take apart our very heart 
and the light will set us free""
Even though the pain of the previous lyrics can be unbearable at times, he know that in the end it will be worth it.

""How frustrating and so degrading
His time we're wasting as time will fly by
and the sky will cry as light is fading
And He is waiting oh, so patiently
while we repeat the same routine
as we will please comfortability""
This is the voice of the close one to the first flightless bird. They are talking about how sad it is for the first flightless bird to want so bad to rise above and live a better life, but he is held back by things like his family and friends, who are fine with staying comfortable and distracting themselves from the problem he sees.

""And please think about 
why you can't sleep in the evening
And please don't be afraid of 
what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil
Your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle
And I promise you this is mine""
I saw this as the second flightless bird being inspired by the first, and getting ready to attempt to fly themselves. They are crying out to their people and family to listen to their own sense of morality beyond themselves, and to judge the flying birds for their satisfaction off of their misfortune.

This is just my interpretation of the song, others are of course valid. 
It's been a little while since a song has been so relatable and so powerful to me. It's songs like these that really pull on my innards and force me to wear out my headphones.

@Mellomagic 















I think this song about just believe is what you believe in and not what others pressure you to believe in. 

""""""
If you decide to live by
what you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning
and decide what we believe
we can take apart our very heart 
and the life will set us free
""""""

Instead of letting others set what you believe, like religion or anything, wake up every morning and decide what YOU believe, and the pressure lifted off of you will set your life free.

As for the rest of the song, what i could see it correlating with this verse above is that the angels and demons know what they believe, while you are pressured to what you believe. You have wings, but you don't know if you truly believe, so they are flightless, but ""if we wake up every morning
and decide what we believe
we can take apart our very heart 
and the life will set us free""

@GregYan I agree. I am amazed at what some people come up with sometimes. 

The first response sounds like a response where that's what they want the song to be about, but I think it couldn't be more off base and is exactly the opposite. Religion, politics, law all create a lot of wrongs when you look at it pragmatically and keep emotion out of it. 

For example, partying, sexual deeds, etc. People do what they want and then are taught to punish themselves for it and others punish them for it. Is it really ""wrong"" because some one else tells you its wrong? Is it really wrong if it doesn't hurt anyone directly?

I'm not answering that question, because I am not God, if there is one. Seems like it sometimes, but then again it seems like there isn't at others. But wait, It's simple, just have faith, right? Well, which religion do we choose from? 

Make the right choice, or you will be abominated. The abomination from others can cause the most pain and confusion for some. The right choice is learned or communicated by the people we are around. So, what's right may be different for a person living in the Middle East than it is for a person in the United States. But some people come up with their own religious beliefs for example regardless of where they live and go by them and are happy.

My experience in life seems to have shown me that to a degree, the only way to avoid hurting people and pain and suffering is to keep your head down, your mouth shut and your eyes closed and turn your brain off and live a simple life. That doesn't come from religion, that comes from my experience. Catch is, that is much harder to do for some people than others, and that can be a biological/psychological/personality/soulful thing as much as anything else. To me these people are those who feel like  ""flightless birds"" when living this simple life. These people are often creatives in a broad sense. They create new things that did not exist before, not just visual artists. I consider scientists creatives, not just musicians, to paint a picture. Without creatives, we would have no music and the world would be the same as it always was.

I do belive, that those who feel like flightless birds must not believe in religion. I mean, how can you expect to go to Heaven if you go against your region? Take Christianity, make no question, there is Hell to pay as far as the Bible is concerned. But if you are an objective person, who is to say there is a Heaven? And who is to say living life like a ""flightless bird"" ins't hell on earth? But again, this is a mindf*ck that things like religion can create for an individual like that.

What throws the entire song off in my opinion is where they speak of knowing good and evil. If you listen to the song ""Heathens"", you have to wonder if that song is personal to them. Well, I can answer that after watching an interview about it. IT IS. In fact, I would be surprised if he could put it any more clearly that this song 100% applies to them. Listen to the lyrics of THAT song, and you may be like me. What exactly do they define as good and evil? No judgement, it just seems a little hard to decipher any concrete message with that line thrown in there, because it seems that it was globally applied.

If you have wings but never leave the ground, there is no hope to get anywhere but also no fear of falling. If we rely on our own strength, we will never truly leave the ground and we will feel cold as we are unable to fly from the winter approaching. It's a strange and depressing expectation that everything will slowly freeze over, but we are too afraid to put our faith in the sky. The sky is unpredictable and difficult to understand, much like God, but without it we will never escape the coming winter.

The last verse describes the sky, or God, crying because we refuse to take flight. But as we attempt to stay comfortable, God is waiting so patiently for us to trust in Him. That being said, don't be afraid of what the truth will uncover. If the sky is really our only hope, we have to accept that sometimes it brings storms as well. We have to pick the side of a difficult truth which leads to life or blissful ignorance that will cause us to die. It is time to choose your battle: will you fight for yourself, which is easy to fight but impossible to win, or will you fight for something greater, which is hard to fight but possible to win?

I think this song is a continuation of taxi cab and the two chronicle the journey of one person to the afterlife and how they come to terms with this. This song seems to be about the person looking back to the real world and describing what actually goes on in the structure of society. Those are just my thoughts.

So I just thought of this. The first 2 lines. “Now is the climax to the story that gives the angels and demons purpose.” I think he’s saying that we are in the end times right now. In the rest of the song he explains that we shouldn’t rely on our own understanding, we must rely on what God says. He’s basically saying we find our worth in the things on this earth, but we are worth more to God than what we find our worth in here. We all must pick whether we want to follow Jesus or let the devil control our lives.

The Italian version, featured in the film Pink Panther, has the following lyrics

Meglio stasera, che domani o mai,
Domani chi lo sa, quel che sarà?

Non mi dire d'aspettare,
Il domani che verrà.
È una porta che tu chiudi,
Fra me e te.

Se stasera ti decidi,
A rispondermi di sì,
I domani che verranno,
Li dedico solo a te.

Meglio stasera, che domani o mai,
Domani chi lo sa, quel che sarà?

Nasce il giorno ed il giorno muore,
E la notte porterà,
L'incertezza del domani,
Chi sa, chi sa?


Basta un desiderio solo,
A non farti riposar',
Ed una pulce sul lenzuolo,
Che dormire non ti fa.

Meglio stasera, che domani o mai,
Domani chi lo sa, quel che sarà?

The translation is as follows:

Chorus: It had better be tonight, than tomorrow or never. Tomorrow, who knows what will be?

Don't tell me to wait for tomorrow to come. 
There's a door that you're closing, 
between you and me. 

Tonight, 
if you decide to say 'yes' to me, 
I'll devote the tomorrows to come only to you. 

(Chorus)

The day is born, the day dies, 
and the night will bring the uncertainty of tomorrow ... who knows, who knows? 
Just a single desire is enough to give you no rest; 
and a solitary heartbeat on the sheets, 
that won't make you sleep. 

(Chorus)

My favorite of F.S. songs. It's hauntingly beautiful with such bittersweet sentiment. I did not discover (enjoy, really) Frank's music until my 40's, although I grew up watching him and Dean (and their musical friends) on television. Those were the days when you sat around the television set with your family after a meal at the table, and was blessed with the likes of the talented musicians of that decade. It was a time of sweet naivety and innocence, which made Sinatra and the like seem like kings.

The final verse makes this song amazing. Here's what I think it means: ""I'm in the autumn of the year"" gives you an idea of his age; around 3/4ths of his life is over. He says he thinks of his life as vintage wine and that the wine is of a very good year, meaning he believes his life was a very good one. So the title ""A Very Good Year"" is referring to a life of great value and happiness. I like the metaphor as a life being compared to a year of wine; there are many years and many lives and, just as there are especially good years for wine, this life stood out specifically as a good one.

			I couldn't agree more. Another idea that flows well with your idea is the universal progression of human life. When we are young and in the spring of our lives, wedon't enjoy life and embrace it for all it is...in the summer of life, we tend to realize how great life can be, but as we are in the prime of life, we tend to take it for granted, thinking it will last forever...in the autumn, while still enjoying life, we have the perspective of life lived that enables us to appreciate where we are and where we've been...finally, winter sets upon us, and I would like to think that in the end, peace and appreciation for a life well lived allows us to know we were truly a vintage batch of wine, and that our life was indeed a very good year. To sum up, I think the progression of capacity to understand life and its parallel to aging are what make this song truly amazing. We may enjoy life with more vigor in our younger years, but we are able to interpret and appreciate our lives more as we age. This song makes aging a beautiful thing...which most American culture does not. Bravo.

I really like Bruno Mars. It's easy to see who or what might have influenced him (Michael Jackson, and for this song a blues tune called Aint No Sunshine When She's Gone) yet he still manages to feel authentic because all of his dramatic passion sounds sincere. His quirky off balance imagery; if you ever leave me baby, leave some morphine at my door works because he has a sort of desperate sensitivity/streetwise gallantry that is missing from other urban drawing artists. Also, his arrangements show an ingenious sophistication despite their simplicity. Go Bruno1

this song means that he cant live his life without his true love and that if she leaves, he would be bawling and his heart would be broken.
when he says 
     And just like the clouds
     my eyes would do the same
     If you walk away
     Everyday it would rain, rain, rain
he means that his eyes would rain like the clouds: he would cry

@believeinyou Interpretation Perfection			

This song really speaks to me and how I've been feeling since I graduated high school.

I feels like my time in this town is done, that I don't belong here anymore, and I need to venture off to some other place to pursue my dreams and learn to live my own life.

""It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then, 
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am.""

My father thinks that if I move out and move on with my life, it's going to change who I am but deep down inside, I'll always be same person. I just need to turn the page and start a new chapter of my life. I absolutely love this song, it tells the listeners a lesson that no matter where life takes you, you don't have to change- just be who you are or who you've always been. :)

I don't want to take the mystery or the personal meaning out of it for anyone.  This can be an emotional song, as it surely was for Dan Reynolds.  So stop reading if you want it to be special for you.

I'll just leave it at this for now:  Imagine you're raised Mormon and you believe it deeply, so much that you honorably serve two years as a missionary in Nebraska, you come back to major in music at BYU, and it isn't working out the way you want it to, or the way you think it should.  Your interest in it is waning.  Now you've started a band and you're going to drop out of your church's most renowned school to pursue your career (Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check).  A lot of emotions probably go with that.  And some of those emotions are in this song.  People might even call your decision-making ability into question (I don't ever want to let you down).  And you might wonder if they're right.

Alvin Maker was about Joseph Smith and so on...Once you understand that and go back and read more of his books you totally understand what he is doing.  It's very good.

It's about growing up and following your heart. Having to walk your own path and letting the people you love follow theirs without holding them back or letting them hold you back. Forgetting about school if it doesn't make sense. Forgetting about a crappy job. In the process of reaching for them we make the hero's journey, going out into the world, telling ourselves we haven't changed despite enormous growth. As time goes on though the relationships begin to break down slowly, each person has grown beyond the place they started.

I believe that this song was about someone who's parents or someone wanted him to become 'better' than they were.  However they did this by pushing him to become something he is not.  He then realized that what they wanted was not what he wanted.  He faces them and they are disappointed.  He then feels like he is on his own and tries to start over on his own.  A lonely road and the old house burned to the ground to erect a new one.

This song means a lot to me. 
I think this song is about someone who is incredibly shy (like myself) and is going through some tough times (depression) and just wants someone to notice ore be his friend, and just when he thinks that very thing will happen, he sinks back down again, However, he eventually realizes he not gonna change for their benefit. I have a lot of real experiences of that sort. People always tell me, oh you should talk more, but they never listen when I do, they just ignore me like always. There will be times when I think, this is it, someone might finally notice me and understand what I'm going through. But then I just sink back into my original form. I'm starting realize, though, that I don't need them. If they can't appreciate me for who I am, what are they really wort? That's what I think this song is all about.

			Curious: how did you treat those people? Did you include them in your REAL life? Did you lie to them about something similar for not days, weeks, or months; rather, for years? Did you pick others over them repeatedly? Are you still absent, but yet not absent from the lives of others?  Could you perhaps be trying to use people for your own selfish wants/needs? And most importantly, do you not change because it's difficult and risky or because you actually love the payoff you currently get (and have been perhaps getting for years)? I'm sorry. I'm just curious. You brought up some interesting sentiment that seemed relevant.

			Interesting perspective TeslaLuna, I wouldn't really interpret this song that way, but I can definitely relate to your interpretation. 

All I can tell you is to be who you are, and find people who love you for that. You may find you end up with people you would never have ""chosen"" to be your friends, but your life will be much more rewarding when you stop trying to appease the people who you wish were your friends and develop deep, meaningful relationships with those who are more complimentary to who you really are at your core. 			





"
587,Jack.json,"
Someone posted this on Spreadnet.  I don't know who to give credit to, but I think he/she nailed it.  Everything below is someone else's words:

Re: Jack Translation

OK, so I was listening to the weekly MP3 of Jack and for an 
unknown reason it occurred to me what that song was about. All of these years, I guess I had never given it any thought. If you already know, then disregard this.

Its about a card game. Actually a Straight Flush. 

""Jack was really a jester who held his one good eye on the queen""

This means that One Eyed Jacks are wild and that the card holder also has a Queen.

""And there sat the king beside her. He's pointing his sword up and down with every scene""

Obviously he has the King of the suit. But this also tells you 
what suit is held. There are only two one Eyed Jacks. Spades and Hearts. The King of Hearts is a Suicide King meaning that his sword is horizontal, so it means that the holder has a Jack, Queen, and King of Spades.

""And the wizard's in the corner, catching peanuts between his teeth""

The Corners of a straight are your high and low cards. Now, I 
have never heard of an Ace being referred to as a Wizard, so I am guessing that Jokers are also wild and that the holder has a Joker to represent his Ace. I will get back to that in a second.

""And the dogs lying in the shadow in the archway. There's one good dog sleeping filled with good ole' dog dreams""

Your Dog is your low card in a straight. In this case it is a two 
of Spades. I will come back to this.

""He slipped next to the wizard, whispered something deep, to the bottom of his ear. A little joke, the one about the farmer's daughter. How she was stomping on grapes, coming up with blue feet and beer. And he slipped behind the queen""

Whats important here is that the holder rearranged his cards. He moves his Jack behind his wizard. In any Poker game, it is important to rearrange your cards even if it is an old trick. Or an old Joke, maybe about a farmers daughter. Then he slips the Jack right back behind the queen where it started.

""Where the fools go the rich don't mind""

Wild cards can go anywhere.

""Lately the king's (k)nights have turned a little rusty, and his halo - I mean his crown - has gone and slipped around his 
eyes""

He is going to have to go from a Royal Flush to a lesser flush. I will demonstrate that.

""The wizard's in the corner, pulling lizards between his knees. And the dog hesbeen long gone, gone to pitch for the winning team""

The Wizard, or Joker had been the corner or high card in the 
hand. Now he pulls the Lizard (Two) to the top card corner. By doing this the two is no longer a Dog and it completes the straight and wins the game.

""Fifty-two, I mean fifty-four bicycles on the wall, ready to ride, ready to ride until the last of them falls. Jack's been cooking in the kitchen, whompin' up some biscuits for us all. For us all. For us all. Ready to ride, ready to ride, ride""

52 Bicycle playing cards in a standard game. 54 when playing with Jokers. The One Eyed Jack was really the pivotal card in this game and ""cooked"" up a win. His hand was Jack, Queen, King, Joker, Deuce. Spades.

Well, what do you think???

The only thing I don't know is ""catching peanuts between his 
teeth.""

How bout a little help.

That above definition is proof that hippies have no concept of reality...particularly if they spend most of their time shootin' squirrels, rippin' bingers and sniffin' teeners while being the Flemmish King of Rocky Hocky. 

Song is about one thing and one thing only...shopliftin' the pooty from the queen while no one's lookin'. Period. If you know much about cards you'll know most of that is contrived.

			Actually an experienced poker player can come out ahead or break even. It's not a complicated game. 

If you have a hand and you've been playing for a while you can tell what other possible hands someone has and make a judgement call.

I've had multiple occasions where I knew I had the highest hand and just waited for someone to call all in. 

Black Jack may be more ""contrived"" I would say luck varied. 

Poker is not gambling. 

Read up on Phil Ivey and get back to me.

This song is definitely about playing cars though I never saw the straight flush interpretation before

I think the poker interpretation is dead on.  Regarding the Mikey vs Jimmy thing:  Mikey was unique which is what made him so popular.  It sad that we lost him, especially so young, but you have to remember that Jimmy came from the same Athens/Horde scene as Mikey and they knew each other well.  If there was ever someone to take over for Mikey Jimmy is the logical choice.  I think he does a great job preserving the feel and message of WSP's music while bringing his own style as well.  Remember, there will never be another Mikey.

			Back then it wasn't meant as a sexual comment, its the people of today that have taken things out of context. It's just you have a very strange mind...

Besides pretty much everything from the 60s onwards is better than music today in my opinion...(today being (the year 2000 onward).

The amount of decent musicians that don't get noticed because of half wits writing down the same *lyric* in each of their songs about 50+ times is ridiculous, then using computerised sounds to make them sound listenable (and if they can't think of what to write next they just add a few swear words or scream down the microphone, while all the time I'm like...seriously!! -.-  'just get some talent'.

 Most musicians nowhere days can't even read music or know what chord their playing. These people so called 'musicians', hmmm lets theorise (put enough monkeys in a room with a typewriter they'll eventually write a line of Shakespeare...doesn't make them writers...same with music).

A professional musician should be someone who can read and write music has learnt more than 1 instrument (by learnt I mean can play a difficult solo...not just lets play C major, F major then G major then E minor and repeat <<<<< just shoot me and end this insanity -.-).

Do you agree?

@TheMagicKingdom02 First of all, it isn't 'bird' it's 'jailbird'. That's someone locked up in jail/prison. Next, why would a girl be in a prison with men? Also, Elvis didn't write it, Leiber & Stoller did. Not sure what they were thinking; probably that the general public wouldn't make anything of it. But those are some pretty suggestive lyrics.

"
589,Jambi.json,"
Tool - Jambi

""Here from a kings mountain view,
Here from the wild dream come true""

He is introducing the song by speaking from the perspective of someone who ""has it all"" in a material sense.

""Feast like a sultan, I do
On treasures and flesh never few""

This person is only concerned about piling up materialistic idols and putting themselves over others. 

""But I would wish it all, away
If I thought I'd lose you just one day""

Although he has everything worldly, he would throw it all away if it meant getting rid of ""you."" (He is about to define ""you"") 

""The devil and his had me down
In love with the dark side I'd found""

He is relating this materialistic mentality of the world to the ""dark side"" or work of the devil. 

""Dabblin' all the way down
Up to my neck, soon to drown.""

He uses the word Dabblin' to describe someone that is digging into this materialistic lifestyle almost as if he is searching for something but the lifestyle is taking over him too much and he is about to 'drown'.

""But you changed that all for me
Lifted me up, turned me round
So I, I would wish this all away""

But ""you"" changed that all for me. Here is that reference to ""you"" again and it is positive. It is the reason he would wish away the fleshy outlook of the world. 


""Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
Begged like a hooker all night long""

Half of the time this person acts very christ-like or pious but the other half of the time this person begs for this ""dark side"".

""Tempted the devil with my song
And got what I wanted all along""

Although this person acts as if they are a noble and good person he is actually getting all of the materialistic and evil lifestyle he craved.

""But I
I would
If I could
I would
Wish it away
Wish it away
Wish it all away
Wanna wish it all away

No prize that could hold sway
Or justify my giving away my center"" 

This is a key lyric of the song, Maynard defines the ""you"" that ""lifted me up, turned me round."" It is his center. Tool is a very spiritual band and I can assure that the center referred to here is not a God, it is the center of himself. It his balance within Nature and this experience, his connection to ""oneness"" or the divine. 

""So if I could I'd wish it all away
If I thought tomorrow would take you away.""

He would wish anything away that swayed him away from his center. He holds his center to a higher respect than his entire external experience. 

""You, my piece of mind, my all, my center,
just trying to hold on one more day.""

Here he clearly defines ""you."" He's trying to hold onto his center and not be caught up in ""treasures and flesh.""

""Damn my eyes!
Damn my eyes!
If they should compromise the fulcrum""

If his eyes should take him away from his fulcrum (a reference to balance), then Damn them. Take away his ability to see in order to restore balance within himself.

""(If) wants and needs divide me
Then I might as well be gone...""

He defines what could take him off balance and that is his own ""wants and needs."" If this does take off his balance, he might as well be dead (gone).

""Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun""

This reference to ""you"" and ""center"" is related to the sun. Like a sun, shine on forever (beyond space and time). Let balance be larger than your current experience. 

""Shine down upon the broken""

Some people have lost their way. In order to fix the broken from their dark side, let their center awaken in them and fix the problem. Remember, the sun is a reference to the center. He's not actually saying let the sun shine light on us and somehow be fixed. The sun is within.

""Shine until the two become one""

""Two become one"" can mean many things, but the short version is to say that the sunlight is the answer and will fix the broken. ""Two become one"" is also a trinity (father, son, holy spirit). Son (you), holy spirit (the light within), father (god state - oneness). 
""Two become one"" can also be seen as duality and oneness. Everything in this world is either a 1 or a 0 just like in the Matrix movie, it's duality (day-night, up-down, good-bad,) without it we would not have this experience. In the Matrix Neo gives up fighting his enemy and instead, lets his body merge with his enemy's. He gives up trying to make duality fight its other part, and instead lets the ""two become one."" 

""Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent sun""

Ironic that Maynard references your balance to the sun again because right after the scene I just described in the Matrix where Neo becomes his enemy, Neo appears as a sun in the final scene. 

""Shine down upon the severed
Shine until the two become one
Divided, I'll wither away
Shine down upon the many.
Light our way, benevolent sun.

Breathe in union
So, as one, survive
Another day and season""

Breathe is a key word here. Breath is the whole focus of meditation and yoga which are two great techniques to finding your center and balance within duality. If everyone is following their center, we all act as one, and we survive to move forward. 

""Silence, legion. Save your poison.
Silence, legion. Stay out of my way.""

Legion is a reference to the group of people still dabbling in the materialistic dark side. The people who seem to be holding onto everything but still can't find what they are looking for. Their poison won't effect the speaker.

@MakeSense  I love your description here, and agree with almost all of it...I think he's referring to his center and the light that shines on the broken here as Christ, however. The word Legion is what gives it away at the very end. Legion is a biblical description of demon possession when someone is possessed by many demons. Christ is the only one who sets people free from Legion, and Christ is referred to as the the Light of the World (physically represented as the sun). He's the Center of all things, everything revolves around Christ. In the biblical story of creation, God says, ""Let there be light,"" and there was light.... That was the FIRST day. Then, on the FOURTH day, God created the sun to govern the day and the moon to govern the night. Symbolism here is that, to the Lord, a day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. In chronology, Christ is created on the first day, but He does not come to earth until the fourth day, 4000 years after the creation. He is the human tangible representative of God on earth. The spiritual light that we can actually comprehend. He came to set us free from the darkness, the evil, the legion. Christ is the center here, and  Maynard really gets that across beautifully here.

@MakeSense Don't agree that the song implies anything about Christ specifically. It's obvious that Legion is a biblical reference, but it's possible to make biblical references without implying that you are a Christian. In the context of the song ""Legion,"" the demon which is many, is intended to represent the opposite of oneness, the enemy: multiplicity of the mind, i.e. the lack of centeredness or one-pointedness of mind. Thereby, the verse:

""Silence, legion. Save your poison.
Silence, legion. Stay out of my way.""

may refer to other people, but it seems much more likely to refer to the speaker's own inherent tendencies that veer him away from the beautiful Sun, his centeredness.

@MakeSense I mostly agree, but it's very obvious that the 'you' he's talking about is not just a part of himself. It's something other than himself, because why else would he beg it to ""shine down upon the broken, severed, and the many"" and to ""shine OUR way"". 
Look, he's clearly talking about the division between God and humanity, something he pointed out in a different song as well: Right in Two. In this song he even says ""shine until the two become one"". This separation between creation and creator bothers him a lot. He revisits this issue multiple times in multiple other songs as well. 
And when he refers to Legion he not only means materialistic and egotistical distractions, he also literally means Legion as described in the Bible. 

Next time, be careful not to taint your understanding of a song with your own beliefs and wishes.

@darkaquatu I'm not disagreeing with you that he is obviously talking about something else when he says shine on forever or when he says shine our way. He clearly says he is talking about a ""benevolent sun"" and I clearly indicated that. As far as other songs go, yes, he talks a lot about monkeys and angels and such in right in two, but he is clearly talking about a center within himself here and a benevolent sun. As indicated by the lines:

""You, my piece of mind, my all, my center"" and also:
""Shine on forever, shine on benevolent sun""

I am also aware that Legion is referred to in the Bible, and that's all well and good. Congratulations for the Bible reference. 1 point for Jesus. Which by the way, are not referred to at all in this song. So how can you discern whether he was referring to the legion in the Bible or the legion in the world of warcraft? Sounds like you may be ""tainting the song with your own beliefs and wishes""

Also, I am unaware of how I am tainting this song with my ""own interpretation"" when how could I offer anything else other than my own interpretation? It's not like you know Maynard personally, or any of us for that matter, and could confirm with undeniable proof what exactly Maynard was thinking. I wrote this 8 years ago and in that time it has helped a small number of people who were curiuos enough to search for it here gain slightly more understanding. I am not the gospel truth and neither are you, this is our own interpretation whether you are aware of that fact or not.

Next time you speak to your inner Maynard be sure not to believe everything he tells you. Cause you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man. :-)

@MakeSense I loved this interpretation. It was not personal, you made an amazing job keeping focused on the words themselves and not on the artist's personal context. Maybe it could be driven by the loss of his mother (who could be an important part of his ""center"" that he had to fight to keep after her absence from this world), but I really think that this is it about this song: our center is what drives us towards balance. It may include other people, or it may just be the whole experience as ourselves. THe beauty of this music is that it perfectly ressonates with a modern-age mantra. Tool really are one of the most spiritual bands I have ever heard :)

As far as people stating so adamantly ""THIS IS ABOUT HIS MOTHER""...ok. So what? It may resonate some feelings about the relationship he has with his mother, but it can also be interpreted individualistically, about the relationship I have with my daughter, for example. I have had moments of despising everything and everyone...but my daughter. And I never will. 

I don't really want to buy into the arguments, and I won't be arguing at all. 

However, it is very...ironic?...that so many ""Hardcore TOOL fans,"" insist that practically *every* song TOOL releases is about Maynard's mother. Interpreting the music that way, is not the real crime committed in and of itself...it's the added line people choose to give again and again, which is, ""A real TOOL fan would know that."" Which is ridiculous. 

A real fan of TOOL would recognize that the band members are individual people, complex in every way as you and I (perhaps more the former than the latter), and the death of his mother is not the only thing that has ever happened in his life. TOOL should be, in my opinion, afforded more respect for their artistic abilities than this sort of pigeon-hole, so many creepy ""fans"" want to place them in.

The name of the band is TOOL. They are a TOOL. Sometimes for aggression. Sometimes for reflection. Sometimes used for anger. Sometimes for sadness. But, the key message in so many songs, is to evolve. Mainly to evolve past the ""Stinkfist"" manner of living, which society throws on us. And, claiming you are a ""real"" TOOL fan and others are not, because they don't point every single thing, specifically, back to the death of his Mother, is nothing but a ""Stinkfist"", in my opinion.

			100% agreed. There is a great interview with the band members in revolver magazine. They said they want people to make up their own interpretations to the music, and NOT  try and analyze and pick apart the music to figure out what the song means to the band. They said it. In the magazine, and it made me love them even more than I already did. Too many things (art, music, poetry) are picked apart, held under a microscope, beaten, and mutilated, by people trying to get out what meaning the author, writer, painter was trying to convey. Well, sometimes the meaning is meant to stay with the author, writer, painter, etc. and we're suppose to find out our own meaning. Instead of ruining the whole experience by being haughty, pompous, dick holes. Of course it's fin to have your own meaning and be curious and ponder what they were writing about, but when people can only see one side of it and then claim that others are not true fans... well that's just bullshit.

			You've got it mate. Jambi is the genie that grants wishes. It was a children's programme, and it's about his losing his mother and his regret from being elsewhere all the time. Being occupied, consumed by the devil, his music career. It's all about his regret and just wanting to be able to take it back, wish it all away. This album is probably the easiest, most face-value album out of all others. Namely Lateralus and AEnima. There are some deep hidden double things in those songs. These songs are all very heart felt, about the loss of his mum, his coming to terms with and accepting some level of spirituality. Before she died, he hated religion, namely Christianity, because of his mum and her hypocritical, two-faced 'friends'. His mum was the only person that he ever felt a connection with, the only person he ever trusted. 

""The Devil and his had me down.
In love with the dark side I'd found.
Dabbling all the way down.
Up to my neck, soon to drown.
But you changed that all for me.
Lifted me up. Turned me round.""
This explains how his mum was the one who changed him, changed his view on life, humans and the world in general. He felt he was drowning in his and everyone else's hatred, but she saved him from himself and the world. But too late. It was too late, and now, he's finally come to terms with everything, his mother's gone. And he just wants to take her back, he realizes his mistake.
""So if I could I'd wish it all away, if I thought tomorrow would take you away
You're my peace of mind, my home, my center
I'm just trying to hold on one more day

Damn my eyes...
Damn my eyes...

Damn my eyes if they should compromise our fulcrum
if wants and needs divide me then I might as well be gone""

Pretty self explanatory really. Beautiful song. To really understand any one song, you have to listen to evry word on every song on 10000 days, and Judith, APC. Wings For Marie, Right In Two. Brilliant band. Can't get enough of them

FROM TOOLNAVY.COM

I think that this song is about how Maynard was on the brink of a problem with excess and he changed for his son, Beacause his son changed him.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Here from the king's mountain view (I am on top of the world)
Here from the wild dream come true ( Its a dream come true)
Feast like a sultan, I do ( I love the excess)
On treasures and flesh never few ( money and women especially)


But I would wish it all, away
If I thought I'd lose you just one day (But I love you and would give it up)


The devil and his had me down ( I know a dark side of excess)
In love with the dark side I've found ( and I tended to like it )
Dabblin' all the way down ( I tried it all )
Up to my neck soon to drown. ( It was starting to be a problem)

But you changed that all for me ( but then you came into my life)
Lifted me up, turned me round ( and I realized you were more important)


So I, I would wish this all away ( So I would give it up)


Pray like a martyr dusk to dawn ( Worshipped excess all night long)
Beg like a hooker all night long ( begged for it...loved it...lived for it )
Shout to the devil with my song ( My Music got me all the excess)
And got what I wanted all along ( And I got all I wanted and more)


But I
I would
If I could
I would
Wish it away
Wish it away
Wish it all away
Wanna wish it all away ( I wanted to leave this life in a way)
No person could hold sway ( nobody could tell me to change)
Or justify my toe just a fine line (nobody could justify my being at the edge)
Giving away my center ( I was giving away my energy and love )


So if I could I'd wish it all away
If I thought tomorrow, they'd take you away ( I realize now )


You're my piece of mind, ( your my focus )
my own (my own son)
my center (my new center of focus and love)
I'm just trying to hold on
One more day ( I am taking it day by day..like anyone else)


Damn my eyes! (damn these temptations I see all the time)
Jambi Eyes....
Damn my eyes...
If they should compromise
A fulcrum (Damn them if they lead me to stray from the balance I have found)
Want and need; ( I need to be mindful of what I want -vs- what I need)
if I need, ( beacause if I need the excess )
Then I might as well be gone... ( I might as well not be here for you at all )


Shine on forever ( Let your love and spirit and who you are shine on forever)
Shine on benevolent son (my SON )
Shine down upon the broken ( Let it shine on me untill my two personas balance)
Shine on 'til the two become one (untill I find that balance through my love of son)


Shine on forever
Shine on benevolent son
Shine down upon the severed
Shine [on 'til / until] the two become one (see above)


Divide and wither away ( If I try to keep these aspects divided I wither away)
Divided, withering away
Shine down upon the many, light our way,
Benevolent son. ( Let your love of your son heal you )


Breathe in union ( So let these two aspects of myself come together)

So, as one, survive (And as one person survive)
Another day and season (and it will get easier day to day ...season to season)
Silence legion save your poison (And temptation to slip dont speak)
Silence legion stay out of my way (And temptation to slip get out of my way)


I really feel like this is it.

A few things to keep in mind :

The whole Son/Sun thing and Jambi being a kingdom with a sultan in Indonesia is fine...Maynard loves the dual meanings....in between sniffs/sips of coke anyone ?

He talks in 10,000 days/Wings about the little light she gave to him he is going to let it shine to guide her home........hmmmm letting a light shine to heal and guide someone you love dearly..... (see above)

Also this song before 10k days/Wings makes sense in that it is about his relationship of focus with his future (son) into his relationship of focus with his past (mom)....nice transition in my opinion....

Jambi"" is a song by American progressive metal band Tool. The song is released as a single and the second track from their fourth studio album 10,000 Days. It was made officially available for radio airplay on February 12, 2007.[1][2] Adam Jones uses a talk box effect during the guitar solo.[3]

The song is in 9/8 time, except for the guitar solo where the rhythm is temporarily changed to 6/4 before going back to 9/8.

It primarily refers to the iambic meter used in the lyrics of the song as 'jambi' means 'iamb' in Finnish.[4]

Drummer Danny Carey stated when bassist Justin Chancellor played the bass track of the song, it instantly reminded him of the children's television program Pee-wee's Playhouse, then singer Maynard James Keenan thought of the genie ""Jambi"" and had the idea to make the song's theme about making wishes

I think what they are saying here is that this person,author has some issues (everybody’s got their demons
even wide awake or dreaming) and to protect the other person in the relationship, they decide to ''leave'', break up, let go (I’m the one who ends up leaving
make it okay).

''Every fire I’ve ignited
Faded to grey''
Maybe this means that this person's past relationships didn't go so well and it was their fault.


Again the person saying this probably has problems, issues with themselves and it's beginning to be a problem in the relationship (cause I’ve got a jet black heart
and there’s a hurricane underneath it trying to keep us apart I write with a poison pen), but the relationship/love is what keeps them going, fighting through the problems (but these chemicals moving between us are the reason to start again)

The realtionship is falling appart and the author is trying really hard to fix it (now I'm holding on for dear life), even though they know it's not gonna go back to what it was like in the past (there's no way that we can rewind).

"
591,Jimmy.json,"
Finally, 10 years later, some clarification from the band!

If you listen to A Perfect Circle's ""Judith"" and more importantly, Tool's new ""10,000 days (Wings for Marie Part 2)"", most is explained.

His mothers name was Judith Marie Keenan.
in Judith, Maynard sings 'fuck your god, he's the one that left you broken down and paralyzed'.
In 10,000 days, he sings '10,000 days in the fire is long enough, you're going home', 'Judith Marie, unconditional one'.

Judith Marie suffered for 10,000 days, perhaps from a stroke that left her paralyzed?
She died on 18 June 2003. Maynard was born on 17 April 1964, so he was 39.2. 10,000 days is 27.4 years.
39.2 - 27.4 = 11.8. He was 11 years old when it happened.

Like Jimmy, the track 10,000 days also refers to ""holding the light"" and the light leading you home. In this track, the light is her gift of guidance and faith in him. Home is heaven.

Therefore I think Jimmy is about Maynard losing his mother as he knew her. He was young and depended on her. ""The face of your own stability"".  He talks to/of himself (jimmy, eleven) in third person as he is no longer the innocent child he was prior to this event. 
Half way through the song, ""So glad that I have found you"" is Jimmy realising that he himself is lost, not her. The person he knew is still with him in the form of the gift of guidance (the light or ""loaded memory"") she has instilled in him, and he goes on to use it to lead a successful life.
""I am wide awake and headed home"". There's an ongoing theme in Tool about pain being necessary to advance, and life being that step (best example is Parabol). ""Heading home"" means living his life, moving forward towards the afterlife. ""as soon as pain allows"" means as soon as he has learned the lessons of life.
""So we can reunite, and both move on together"". Maybe the song is about them reuniting back to the state of happy memories, when they become ""one"" in the afterlife. There's also an ongoing theme of collective consciousness through much of Tools work.

Anyway, my main point being that Tool's new work surely confirms ""he"" is mjk and ""she"" is jmk.

@xlynx9 Also would like to point out (might be by coincidence) than in the track 10,000 days, when he says ""Give me my Wings"" , it was at 5:39, given that he was 39 when his mother died, it was like, confirmation or something.

@soakedinsoul I Think this is mostly right. However, I think many of the lyrics pertain to him reuniting with his inner child to heal through that trauma that was likely somewhat repressed or unresolved. As an adult he's asking his inner child to remind him what it was like to be a shining innocent youth, help him through the painful memories and rather than repress them, shine through, accept then as reality and heal as an adult while also trying to reincorporate his inner-child. The entire last segment of the song is about exactly that in my opinion.			






@xlynx9 Also would like to point out (might be by coincidence) than in the track 10,000 days, when he says ""Give me my Wings"" , it was at 5:39, given that he was 39 when his mother died, it was like, confirmation or something.

Ok, first off I wanna say that I never sign into sites like this.... but just reading all the bullshit on here was just pissing me off. Honestly are you people really that dumb? Obviously 90% of you aren't actual tool fans or maybe bought one CD and consider yourself Maynard experts. Yes Maynard has said that his songs are purposely written in a way that could have several meanings and leaves it open for the listener to interpret it the way they want (that's why he never discusses what his songs are about). But come on...... Sept 11th.....guess he sees into the future, Horoscopes, Numerology, The 11 11 time clock crap, and the list goes on and on. I mean some of you morons are talking about his sister (which P.S. doesn't exist since he's an only child), his mom Peggy, Susie, Kathy. Just stop embarrassing yourselves if you don't know the facts about his family, at least the basics like his moms name. Oh yeah I almost forgot besides getting his moms name wrong lots of you got HIS name wrong. HOW THE HELL COULD YOU BE ON THIS SITE AND NOT AT LEAST KNOW THAT HIS BIRTH NAME WASN'T MAYNARD. The songs name is jimmy.........his name is James......hmmmmmm I wonder who the songs about........maybe his dog. Anyway long story short the song has a pretty simple meaning people......just put the pipe down cause it's not doing all of you any good. It's about him as a boy jimmy......his mom became paralyzed when he was 11...he was sent off to his dads when he was 11..........his whole world changed because of what happened to his mom when he was 11............1+1.......11...the end.

The band is heavily into things like sacred geometry, synchronicity, Timothy Leary, questioning everything, etc it strikes me as very ignorant that you think there's no possible way 11 in this song has a double meaning and just write it off as ""time clock crap"".  It's called synchronicity and it's not a coincedence that Rosetta Stoned is 11:11 long.

Your interpretation isn't wrong but it's a shame you feel the need to get angry at people who see more meaning in the song than simply ""he's singing about being 11"".  Do you think the world would be a better place if everyone treated you like garbage because you don't believe in synchronicity?

			Actually everyone here is basically correct and on the right track. It does have to do with 9/11, numerology, his mother, 1+1, all of it actually.

11 represents duality. We're missing the mother aspect of our souls because we are separated from nature which is why everything is going to reset. So we're just 1 missing the other 1, 11. You have to heal the trauma from not having the mother aspect. This is both spiritual and literal for Maynard obviously.

1 & 1 is 1, 11

""The 2 shall become one.""

9/11 had to do with destroying the 2 pillars that hold up the world. It was a symbolic representation of that. It's Masonic. They are tearing down this world so they can build a new one. Creating chaos so they can make order out of chaos. A new world order.

I think that this song is about a man who's always there to cheer up everyone when they are sad and hides his own misery from them and himself. He lies to himself saying tat everything would be okay. He had to be okay, so he convinces himself of it. Everyone takes him for granted and he is scared to ask for help because they think of him as an infinite person and doesn't want people to get worried. Eventually he gets tired of life and feels that nobody cares and nobody would unless he was gone forever. His reason to live was to help others, but he stops caring one day. So he locks himself to end himself and someone is trying to make him change his mind because they do notice him.
To me, this is about making someone feel appreciated and loved because they deserve it the most.

He's talking about an important person in his life he looks up to who is giving up, and knows if this person is gone he'll be lost. This person is telling a lie by telling everyone they're fine and nobody should worry. This person never got the recognition they deserve ""the man deserves a medal but he never really one a prize. I think ""he goes to lock the door"" can be taken metaphoricly, he's shutting people out, or literally, closing the door so they can off themself. If you take it the second way it's far more dramatic as it now seems as the person telling the story is actually banging down the door and trying to tell them it's ok and they love them

@Kevintranap 















In my mind, this song speaks to several undertones of Twenty One Pilot songs if not all. As an avid listener and huge fan of this band, and as biased as it may be, I believe this song is about suicide. The character, referred to as Johnny Boy, has decided to commit suicide. This song is basically a dictation of the moment he is found dead by  people who seem to have cared about him as they say ""you're my pride and joy"" (which is most likely just his wife's words). The world/fate (or some other higher force) could not save him in that moment although their was a general sense that he had determined an end to his life. ""Johnny Boy"" has some sort of ""disrespect"" for himself leading to his suicidal thoughts, but everyone else responding to the situation blames it on circumstances that happened to him.
       I believe that this song does give the message that he did commit suicide, successfully or not, he was ""lying on the floor."" The people calling to him give off a distant and fading last call for his life to be saved by letting him know that he is loved, ironically timed as he is no longer mentally present to hear how he is appreciated. Another reference for his lack of appreciation are in the verses ""The man deserves a medal, but he's never really won a prize before.""
      The overall message to me is that we should appreciate people while they are with us. We may feel love and compassion for someone, but without telling them directly, there is no way to know for sure that they are aware of it themselves. On the other hand, suicidal thoughts should not be acted on with such haste. Johnny may have killed himself for many reasons but solidified by the lack of respect for himself and the lack of attention from others. If he had approached the people in his life about his feelings or stuck through his life he could have had the chance to live to the day that someone told him he was loved. Unfortunately this wasn't the case, and this song is just a memoir of feeling for a man who may never have known how much he was loved before he ended his life for a lack there of.

@edgeofhumanity 















This song has always painted a picture of a man who's deeply depressed and contemplating suicide. A lot of people think it's something religious and they're probably right but this is how I see it. 

""He stays home from work this time
He never really told his wife""

He stays home from work and doesn't tell anybody. Strikes me as something somebody who's made up their mind to take their own life would do if they don't want someone to stop them. 

""He never really told a lie but this time he decides that it's alright.
It's alright.""

He's never really liked before, but he decides to start now by not telling people he's staying home? Again seems like something somebody who plans to end their life would do. He decides alright, perhaps because of the common thought among the depressed that when he's done the deed ""the world will be better off without him?"" He thinks by telling this lie and allowing himself to end his life he's doing his loved ones and himself good thus justifying the lie?

""No one really knows his mind and no one knows behind his eyes.
The man deserves a medal
But he's never really won a prize before.""

The sad truth about many/most depressed people. Others don't understand them, they don't know what happens in their heads. He's done some exceptional things that have gone unrecognized and that's driven him further down this dark path. 

""He goes to lock the door.""

This line gives me chills. He's locking the door and effectively sealing his fate. Nobody can stop him now. 

""He is falling
And though he knows it's not
The world looks down and frowns.""

This part might be a bit of a stretch but he is ""falling"" to the ground after doing it? He knows deep down this is wrong, but depression has taken over his mind and the larger part of him now thinks this is the right decision. Again, he feels he's making the world a better place, but he's actually doing the opposite-""the world looks down and frowns."" 

""Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy,
Get up cause the world has left you lying on the ground.""

In the p.o.v. Of one of his loved ones? They want him to recover, to not make this horrible decision to kill himself because the world has him ""lying on the ground."" They want him to get up because it does get better. 

""You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now.
We all need you now.""

Again from one of his loved ones, just continuing to explain that he does have value. Another thought that seems to creep into the mind of many depressed-that they have no worth to others. But the truth is that his family and loved ones really need him, he's just consumed by this horrible disease. 

""Someone said where you going
Someone said to you goodbye""

People do care about him. They want to know where he's going and what he's doing. Perhaps this person is saying goodbye fully unaware that this could be the very last goodbye between the two of them. 

""They deflect the disrespect when they say that they blame it on the times
They blame it on the times.""

They're blaming this depression of his on hard times in the world in general? Kind of telling him to get over it because everyone is a little unhappy? Obviously this is the exact wrong thing to tell somebody who's depressed because it's a totally different kind of sadness, which led him to what happened in verse 1. 

We all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife
They all know you're qualified but they lie when they blame it on the times.
And we blame it on the times.

He's a fully functioning human being. He can do things everyone else can do. These people who are blaming it ""on the times"" see that he can still function and assume nothing is really wrong with him. 


So this is what the song means to me. I'd love for others to add thoughts to this. Easily one of my favorite songs right now.

I believe that song is about a war veteran struggling from PTSD. 

""No one really knows his mind and no one knows behind his eyes.""
This line could mean that nobody knows how he is struggling with the horrors of war.

""The man deserves a medal, But he's never really won a prize before""
In my opinion this line indicates that he was an unrecognized war hero.

""He goes to lock the door.""
Indicates that he is closing himself off to the world.

""Get up Johnny boy, get up Johnny boy,
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy, you're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now""
The chorus means to me that he fought for his country but is now struggling from PTSD and not getting the help he needs from his country that he risked his life to keep free.

""Someone said where you going
Someone said to you goodbye
They deflect the disrespect when they say that they blame it on the times
They blame it on the time.""
This means to me that nobody appreciated what he was doing and they just blamed his new disorder on something that they couldn't control, or ""The Times""

""We all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife
They all know you're qualified but they lie when they blame it on the times.
And we blame it on the times.""
Now this shows me that nobody really paid attention to him when he was in the army and now that he has come back he cannot find a good proffesion to help get him and his family through.

""I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame
And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame
And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame""
This is the final straw for me.  It proves to me that the names of the men that fell on the line fire beside him still tuant hm and he knows he will not forget them though many others will.

Again this is only my opinion but I think the=at the evidence is there.

I can't help but think of Johnny, from a popular book/movie ""The Outsiders"". Johnny was abused by his father and was more of a quiet character. *MAJOR SPOILER IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK*: He was Ponyboy's (the main character) best friend and died after he tried to rescue children from a burning church (I could elaborate more but it's about the song). The point? Johnny died not in vain and was Pony's only friend ""Get up Johnny Boy"", his thoughts that he can't live without him; he was his ""pride and joy"".
I think the song definitley relates to this. Someone losing a part of them or a physical person and thinking it's the end, but they carry on.

I guess it points to a secret failure, mostly  images of suicidal, but also of that man who decides it’s alright to keep a dishonorable secret, locks the door so no one can see this secret romance with whatever vice left up to imagine.... yet in keeping it from the wife and the world he is trapped and wallowing in his dishonor, stripped of his true identity and left powerless on his own... unless he relies on the One able to carry his shame , secret name, and restore him to his intended true identity.   Ok that’s my two cents, Maybe I just read into things :)

"
596,Johnny Too Bad.json,nil
597,Jubilee Street.json,"
The protagonist was a client of Bee, a prostitute, who had a room down on Jubilee Street. When Bee was closed down the Russians moved in their sex workers. The Russians made the scene more intimidating'; their presence pricked the allusion of romance and love that the protagonist had felt for Bee.

As Bee had been shut down, she could no longer make money as a sex worker, She had to make ends meet some way or other. She blackmailed him, as his name was on every page of her little black book. 

He was besotted by her and also hated her, which is why there is the conflicting imagery of him pushing a wheel of love but also having a a 10 ton catastrophe on a 60 pound chain. This threatening image is of his male sexuality perverted by rage and fear from the blackmail and the chance of being publicly exposed. 

Down on Jubilee Street he went into a dis-associative state - our of his mind - and did something which is against what he preached. He was not personally troubled by having had sex with Bee in the past, he did so willingly. However he was against violence but this time he did not practice what he preached - he harmed or probably murdered Bee. 

After he had harmed or killed Bee, his reputation was no longer threatened and he still had his status - he could wear his tie and tails about town as though he were a respected man. Gone was the 10 ton catastrophe on a chain replaced by a foetus on a leash: potent male rage now calmed, impotent and under control. 

The last stanza is the freedom of one who had been trapped and feared public exposure but no longer does. All that threatened and allured has gone - Bee and the furniture in the room - and he is liberated from his sexual needs and the fear of blackmail. 

The song has a brutal individualism to it. Unlike Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment who was compelled to guilt plead guilty by the fact he had murdered, the killer in this song is redeemed by his act without any other obvious consequence other than preservation of himself. The values he held have been dispensed with in the need to protect and preserve the individual.

			PatrickO, your interpretation is one of the most coherent and well articulated I've come across on this site. Good work.			






			PatrickO, your interpretation is one of the most coherent and well articulated I've come across on this site. Good work.			

After watching the video, I feel like this comes a little clearer. There are 2 layers in the storyline I think, one from the point of view of a young prostitute, Bee, while the other one belongs to the man that got her pregnant (foetus on a leash, where leash is simply the umbilical cord?) For some reasons Bee has to leave the apartment in Jubilee Street where she received their clients (probably she's turned down by them because they discover the pregnancy -- or maybe caught and arrested) and so the man, who somehow was obsessed with her ""is too scared to even walk on past"" (maybe eaten by guilt and memories and all of that).

I think this could be all wrong, but the song to me is more generally about how people focus on a fake appearance of morality and decour, but then deep inside they all know they are fucked up and desperate and, ultimately, need love, no matter how ""dirty"" and immoral it is. The contrast here is beautiful, Jubilee Street is a symbol for this formal morality, this masquerade of social order, somehow connected with the figure of the Queen (the ultimate thing is that Bee could be a nickname for girl called Elizabeth) and all that she represents. But on Jubilee street there's darkness too, there are prostitutes and stories going horribly wrong. Guys, this is still Nick Cave after all.

To me Jubilee Street represents the people of church and the main character the pastor or the priest.
He's got love in his tummy, didn't mean no harm, the ten-ton catastrophe is in his soul.
Maybe her abortion was his, d'nt matter, morals d'nt matter, he got busted and ruined his reputation, now he's the one that has no past, should have practised what he preached... or should he? 
Now that he is really alone, now that he has no furniture, only now beyond recriminations, he can go dowtown on his tie and tail, look at him! He glows, vibrates, he's flying. 
Only one larvae suffering it all through becomes a butterflies. Her peers only survive until death without transformation.

@gughiman i can't stop associating his transformation with Kafka's ""Metaporphosys"" -- for no obvious reason.			

I was driving through Whitechapel the other day and turned into a road called ""Jubilee Street"". My partner raised the possibility that the song could actually be a reference to this street, as it's in the area where Jack the Ripper murdered prostitutes. 

I did a brief Google search and found references to the history of the street, including a period where the ""Russians moved in"". Also, if you search for this street and Jack the Ripper, there are some links, especially to a suspect who attended the Jubilee Street Anarchist Club.

This theory fits with the ""Tie and tails"" vision, and Nick Cave has written about Jack the Ripper before, so is this a re-imagination? I can't find any other clues that it is, but thought I'd share what I have.

@dickymoore 















I don't know how many pop musicians can write a beautiful, interesting and intelligent song on a public library. Nick Cave was able to do that, in a very amazing way. This song is about Bee, that is an old brownfield site in Brighton UK, which was regenerated through a private finance initiative of £50 million, in order to obtain a fantastic public library. Notoriously, in Brighton there's a relevant Russian community, and many natives know Russian language. Nick Cave visited the library, and has become enthusiast about it. However, he was a little bit sorry, because at the library - baby boogie - all of his songs were on the little 
black book (black list), therefore it was not possible for babies to listen to them. From my point of view (disco DJ), the song is precious, because it goes from 76,5 to 94 BPM. In conclusion, I hope it will enter into baby boogie service, also in memory of Nick's dead son.

I interpret this song as being about hypocrisy.  Not practicing what you preach.  Protagonist  is attempting to maintain the appearance of respectability (tie and tails) even while the is loathing himself for being involved with prostitution (10 ton catastrophe and 60 lb chain being the weight of his guilt).  
But at some point he gives in to his temptations, he's alone and beyond recrimination (he's past the point of caring about what others think).
curtains are shut and furniture is gone - feels protected and his only focus is the sexual act he's involved in
The rest of the song seems to be orgasmic in nature - transforming, vibrating, glowing, flying

"
598,Just A Kiss.json,"
This song seems pretty self explanatory, or at least this is my impression the chorus says it all

""Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
I don't want to mess this thing up
I don't want to push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight""

He/she is saying that they are content with how things are going and that they are fine with just a kiss good night because they dont want to move to fast or push to hard and drive the other person away and possibly mess things up. They love each other and believe that the other person could be their future husband/wife soul mate type of deal.

On a personal level this song definitely what im going through with a really good friend. She is my world and i absolutely love her to death and these lyrics fit perfectly to describe the situation. 
So that's my opinion

599,Just Another Thing.json,nil
600,Just the Way You Are.json,"
My Girl(friend) knows I don't like today's music and don't listen to the radio at all. We have known eachother for three years and she was my first friend when I moved to another state, and we always wanted to be a couple but neither of is knew it/had the guts to ask eachother. I wasn't very social, and all I knew growing up was how to treat a girl and make a girl happy based on The Beatles' songs and what my father (R.I.P.) has taught me. 

My girl and I have been much closer lately and all I can really say when I'm with her are compliments, how much I love her, and how she is perfect. I never knew this song existed until just two days ago when we were having a slight argument over texting, she texts me saying that this song reminds her of me.

""Just The Way You Are"" - had me thinking it was a song about being a jerk and I was about ready to get mad at her. Once I listened to it, I fell in love with her. It made me so happy to realize that she actually DOES listen to me when I talk to her about compliment her enough to have a song dedicated to her. The best part is that every lyric in this song, I have said to my girl, before even knowing this song was released. 

Great song to dedicate to your girl, especially if you live up to the lyrics; even better if your girl dedicates this song to the way you act.

I'm sixteen.

One thing I might add to what people have said is that it's apparent that the girl is self conscious about how she looks. The guy is trying to convince her that she is fine the way she is. I know this is the case with a lot of girls out there that I have talked with. Always wondering and thinking that they are too fat, too tall, not pretty enough, hair not done well enough, not enough make-up, etc. Many times us guys try to tell them that they do look pretty they way they are, but the self conscious feeling still yells louder than the guys' words and she ends up not fully believing him. That's one reason why this song is beautiful because its a story of what happens all the time.

Adding to everyone else, I absolutely love this song. When I get into a relationship, this song will be my theme song. Its the sweetest romance song that I've heard.

I think you have to break Elvis's work into two Eras, Pre - 1968 and post 1968. Elvis evokes such imagery of the entire song's story from the weather to the old man , the preacher, and the tows. The music is almost sub lineal and simple but it plays a powerful feeling in the song. Talk about the greatest comeback in music, from Jail house Rock to Kentucky Rain wow! Believe it or not Number 2 form and  for personal reasons is If I Can Dream.  Thanks Elvis we miss yo but to paraphrase one of your lyrics ""You are always on our minds.""

"
606,Kick The Dust Up.json,"
Country music may have a reputation as a dumbed-down brand of music meant for backwoods rural folk, but according to a new study released this week the genre actually boasts the smartest lyrics of any major American genre over the past 10 years. According to the analysis, country had a “readability score” well above pop, rock, R&B and hip-hop, though that wasn’t saying much. Country’s average reading level came in at just above third grade.Kick the Dust Up is representative of a systemic issue plaguing country music, which is that so many of the biggest singles are written by the same handful of writers. Why are there so many party songs that sound just like That’s My Kind of Night and Kick the Dust Up? Because half of them are written by Dallas Davidson and Co! The number of hitmakers has shrunken into a tiny, label-approved pool. According to a report by the Tennesseean earlier this year, Nashville has lost a whopping 80% of its songwriters since 2000, and that lack of variety is (unsurprisingly) leading to a lack of lyrical variety as well.

Country may be the most intelligent genre for now, but with songs like Kick the Dust Up permeating airwaves, it’s looking dumber and dumber by the moment




Country had a leg-up on rival genres thanks to longer words like “tacklebox” and “Louisiana""

The study didn’t take into account metaphors, tone or potentially playful lyricism, and instead based its findings on word count, word length and the number of syllables contained in each word. Country had a leg-up on rival genres thanks to longer words like “tacklebox” and “Louisiana”, according to author Andrew Powell-Morse, though he also argued that country’s intelligence was in decline over the past 10 years. Among the genre’s biggest stars, Carrie Underwood’s lyrics were deemed the smartest at a grade level of 3.72 and Florida Georgia Line’s deemed the dumbest, with just a 2.93 reading level. As it turns out, lines like “This is how we roll/We rollin’ into town” aren’t considered especially smart.

The study’s conclusion that country lyrics are getting dumber is well-timed given the release of Luke Bryan’s thuddingly dim new single Kick the Dust Up, which will undoubtedly become the A-lister’s latest No 1 track. (They all do. He has been the genre’s biggest star for two years running.) It is almost a carbon-copy of Bryan’s divisive That’s My Kind of Night, which Zac Brown unceremoniously called “the worst song I’ve ever heard” in a radio interview, claiming that songs like it made him “ashamed to be even in the same format”.

I hate to be the one to point out the obvious, but Gunpowder, Gelatin & Dynamite are 3 basic explosives. They are all volatile, dangerous. Exciting! Throw in the Lazer Beam for a good rhyme and more raw energy.

Freddy did confess on several occassions that this song was just about a high society call girl. In particular, I agree with psa09140: Freddy had Christine Keeler in mind when he wrote the song. But, most people on this list are WAY too young to know who she is.

Also: wazojugs -- Margaret Thatcher was not PM when the song was written in 1974. Learn something about history.

			Though, she was, rich she always felt poor. She tried to make herself happy by surrounding herself with fancy, exspensive things, but money only mad her suffer more


This song has absolutely nothing to do with homosexuality.  

Freddy Mercury said:

""It's about a high class call girl. I'm trying to say
that classy people can be whores as well. That's what
the song is about, though I'd prefer people to put
their own interpretation upon it - to read what they like into it.""

He did say that it is open to interpretation.  I would take it a step further and say that it is about a female assassin / secret agent who poses as a high-class prostitute.

Throughout the song it refers to the technology she uses as a secret agent / assassin:


Gunpowder
Dynamite
Laser Beam
(not sure about the reference to gelatine)

Other references to her secret agent / assassin:

-Of course, the most obvious, she's a ""Killer Queen""
-Khrushchev and Kennedy- they were key figures during the cold war....it implies that she spies for one or the other or both
-met a man from China, possibly a target of hers
-never kept the same address (covert)
-Fastidious and precise

Then of course all of the references to her ""cover"" as a prostitute and how well she played the part:

-champagne, caviar, perfume, etc.
-well versed in etiquette
-blow your mind (double meaning- sex and also assassin)
-recommended at the price (this could also be a reference to her work as an assassin or prostitute)
-reference to Marie Antoinette, the queen of France
-Geisha (not sure about Minah...it is a legend of the Sisters' Islands...off the islands of Singapore....maybe a place she had to go for her secret agent work)
-spoke like a baroness
-Insatiable an appetite

Apparently she is out the business for a spell:
""Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas""

An awful lot of information in a song of 3 minutes 1 second!!

@waynecat  Gelatine is one of the Main ingredients in a Plastic explosive because straight Gelatin is very volatile.			

I hate to be a b*tch, but every line gives its own answer...many of your comments refer to historical inaccuracies due to timelines...here we go...

Everything up through the first chorus is referring in general to the well-groomed ""Will and Grace"" & ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" gay man.  

The Kruschev and Kennedy line is basically referring to ""if they'd just get it over with and make it then everything would be fine.""

Dynamite with a laser beam.  Are you freaking kidding me?  Are there no gay men on this site?  Laser beam is weenie!

Gunpowder/gelatin think people think...what shoots out of a ""laserbeam"" and is a sticky gelatin substance?

Guaranteed to BLOW your mind! Do you really not get this yet?

Insatiable an appetite...a common stereotype for gay men.

To avoid complications, she never kept the same address.  Yes, yes, yes! You got it, a high class TRANNY, well paid at that.

The Geisha line refers to the most famous of all transvestites, Madame Butterfly!  I can't believe no one got that one

If you are that way inclined...again, how literal does Freddy have to be for you guys to get it.

Momentarily out of action...a female prostitute could go all night, but a male would need a short period for recovery, ya know.

If you think playful as a pussycat refers to a woman, think again.  It refers to a man who is as COY as a woman.

Some people think the last lines are ""wanna try..wanna try"" they are actually ""What a Drag""

That says it all... now, if you want to take an introductory poetry class, let me know.  The first thing you'd learn is that metaphors are not mixed.  A message in a poem is generally consistent.  Freddy Mercury is one of the greatest poets in music.  I doubt he'd mix his metaphors.

Sorry again to be so bitchy.

People are used to hard rock, energy music from Queen, yet with this single you almost expect Noel Coward to sing it. It's one of those bowler hat, black suspender belt numbers — not that Coward would wear that. (...) It's about a high class call girl. I'm trying to say that classy people can be whores as well. That's what the song is about, though I'd prefer people to put their interpretation upon it — to read into it what they like. -Freddie Mercury

This is what I love about Eminem. He doesn't care what people think of his music. He expressed what he felt through this song toward his ex-wife. I know he would never do half of the stuff he said in the song like choke Kim. But don't we all say things we don't mean when we are mad? This song is very intense. It made me want to cry the first time I heard it. ""I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! I SWEAR TO GOD I HATE YOU! OH MY GOSH I LOVE YOU!"" That line I think wraps up the whole song. He thinks he hates her. He is jelous, angry, disappointed. He's so mad, but he still loves her. This song will ALWAYS be a favorite of mine.

i heard stan before this and i was shocked by THAT. i remember we were parked in my friends car (not doing ANYTHING illegal, mind you) and this song came on the random. we both sat there with our jaws to the ground. what i think is great about the song is that you can actually visualize whats going on, because eminem is so descriptive. oh yeah, this song is not scary, it is not messed up. eminem gets a bad rap, but this song is obviously a fantasy that eminem probably has. and who hasn't fantasized about exacting revenge on someone who did them wrong?

there is nothing weird about this song at all, nor is it scary. it's the truth. it's a thought that Eminem might have had or is still having. people get mad at other people every day and if this is how he gets through the day then damn, let him. he's not threating her. one amazing thing about Eminem is that he isn't afraid to tell the truth, to tell everyone what he is thinking. when i first heard this song yeah it was shocking, it was a level that Eminem hadn't reached before but if he has the balls to say it then let him. it's his first amendment right. sorry that some people are just way to think headed to see past first impressions.

Yes, the song is dark and morbid, but that's the kind of music I and a lot of people like to listen to sometimes. I understand that it's not for everyone, but it's fucking Eminem, what do you expect? People who say they hate this song have a right to their opinion, but if you don't like this kind of music, then you should know just from Eminem's reputation that you should not to listen to his music. Anyway, I prefer his darker songs like this one and ""Stan"", which I personally think are probably his two greatest songs, more than his more shallow songs (like ""Ass Like That"" for instance). I like that Eminem is willing to explore the ugly side of relationships and isn't afraid to put real people and sometimes real events and/or fantasties he's had into his songs. There's a real honesty in this song. You can sense that seething repressed anger. I like that raw emotion- you don't see that in a lot of modern music, especially in this genre. And it's so catchy too, despite how raw and open it is. 

I will say that I'm glad Eminem found an outlet for all his anger, but I don't think he'd be a homicidal maniac like some people seem to think if he hadn't found a way to let out his anger through his music. Or maybe he would. There is a fine like between madness and brillance after all. I think this song is brillant. Both the words and the music. The chorus is really catchy and pretty much explains how he's feeling and what he's thinking. ""Bitch you did me so wrong, but I don't want to go on without you."" 

3 hoorays for fucked up dysfuctional relationships!!!

Son Of A B*TCH!!! What a powerful song! I just listened to it after reading some of the comments here but seriously...didn't expect it to be SO descriptive... darn.... em's performance had me on the edge of my seat through the whole song, he put so much emotion to it i could believe he was actually crying when singing it LOL

And i really can't understand those close-minded people hating this song, it is obvious that thats just his way of letting his anger out so that let it out in a much worse way... i dont believe that anyone who got betrayed doesnt relate to this song, it's just that great need of revenge you get when you find out i guess... he could have done without the BLEEED at the end though! LOL
(Whats that freakish sound at the end btw? burying her? brrrr LOL)

			No putting her in the trunk it's a prequel to Bonnie and Clyde. I think people aren't hating on the song so much as hating on the fact he lied to Kim and promised her he wouldn't perform this love  when he knew she was in the audience and then did while attacking a blow up doll and getting the audience to sing with him. What kind of fucked up thing is that to do to a person? And it led  to her suicide attempt then he said ""I hope you don't expect me to cancel any concerts just because you were in hospital.

I believe it isnt so much about greedy people wanting money, I believe its more about power without responsibility, when someone actually gets something without trying, (Wish I may, Wish I might)
And then when they recieve all this power, they end up failing in the whole resposibility department.....
Come to think of it, kinda like Bush.
Power comes with responsibility is the general Idea, the people who screw over their own countries for themselves, and then go about blaming others. Its about corruption with power, not money. (but I guess their the same thing in some cases)
The video clip supports this

I think that it is about greed, but not necessaily about wanting everything and trying to take all. I see it ass a reference to coporate america and the ceo's and such who see it as their life goal to ammass a great wealth. So what if they are greedy, Thats not what the song is about. Its the fact that these people although are kings in society and socially, are kings of nothing. They have no community, no family, nothing to love, and no one to love them back. They dont donate becuase they want to, if they do only becuase its social protocol. Thats what it means to me. They have everything but they don't know whats important and are kings, but kings of nothing (of actual value)

			I believe its the way of the rulers, like Louis the Third and Vlademir Lenin, that inspired this song. they all got to greedy (except Louis because he didnt bone his wife, so she got greedy) and were exiled or killed by the Revolutions. how could could they have power,a castle, leadership without anyone to support them?

hi, i joined this website just to post this.

the reference to the star is a play on the ""wishing star"" rhyme. it is on the start of Disney's pinocchio.
the exact rhyme is ""star light, star bright, first star i see tonight. i wish i may, i wish i might, have this wish i wish tonight.""

in this song he wishes he owned the star and wishes he had everything. he uses a wishing star for a wholly selfish reason. i reckon this is supposed to show just how greedy they are.

616,Kitchen Sink.json,"
A kitchen sink -- I feel like he's expressing that everyone has their own way of dealing with things and feeling some way.

In his inner circle, or his world, a kitchen sink means something specific...its his thing, and he believes everyone should have their own thing.   (I personally feel like a kitchen sink, for him, relates to the saying, ""everything but the kitchen sink."" Referencing the kitchen sink being 'left out' and alone. So when he references that he is the kitchen sink, hes referencing that he is unique)

Clearly, the rest of the song is motivating.  A pick me up for other 'kitchen sinks.'  

'leave me alone,
Don't leave me alone'

When youre in a spot like this you might confuse yourself and say you don't need people.  But youre really just screaming for people to see you and appreciate you.

Find purpose in whatever you can.  Don't worry whether youre good or bad at it, just do it, and like he says, 'you'll see purpose start to surface'

Thats my take anyhow.

Well... what I think is that when he says the words ""leave me alone.. don't leave me alone"" is like when you want everyone out of your life, but you want that one person to notice when you say your ""fine"". It's like when you want to be left alone when you say ""im fine"" but you want that one person to notice you're lying. 
     Something else I noticed, when he says ""a kitchen sink to you is not a kitchen sink to me"" is that we find our own meaning in things. We all have different ways of solving things.

@TØP21 I remember reading somewhere that if you ask someone three times (or thereabouts) if they're ok only on the third time will they give you an honest answer. As you suggest the other times we sort of think the person doesn't really care if they only ask once or twice ...so we give them a simple ""I'm fine"" ... but three or more times and we actually think maybe they really do want to know!

Sometimes when I'm feeling trapped in a rut or overwhelmed with responsibility or especially feeling loneliness, with no one I feel comfortable opening up to, I just feel the desire to create something to express myself. Whether it's writing my thoughts down, painting, etc., I find that that piece of expression becomes a meaningful part of coming to terms with my personal trials, even though my work is nothing I'd be comfortable with even showing to others.  

What I really appreciate about this song is that Tyler is saying that he had a personal experience with a kitchen sink, and though that might mean nothing to us, it means something to him, and that's what's important. He's saying that we should find something to express ourselves, have personal experiences on our own that we can hold sacred to only ourselves. 
We're living in an age where it's easy to be on screens all the time, but instead of spending all our time consuming media, it's much more fulfilling to create and find meaning in those things.

This song and video exemplifies a coping strategy to emotional abuse. 

Particularly child emotional abuse, where the caregiver who is actually supposed to be responsible for the child's development and growth, will instead ""spit venom"" ""hiss and preach"" and is also a hypocrite (""when your words mean nothing""), the child needs to find a healthy way to get away. This is seen in the music video: youtube.com/…

""I'm gonna drown you out before I lose my mind""

Children who grow into adults while holding on to the abuse as true (e.g. thinking they deserve the venom and hissing, and the caregiver's hypocrisy is somehow correct), will indeed become crazy. 

""If my heart can't stop it, I find a way to block it""

If the child can't stop the pain coming from this abuse, they will drown it out with a simple ritual. What's so sad about this song is how inane and childish the ""la la la"" sounds--when I first heard this song, I only heard those words, and thought it was so silly and clanging. It was only after I saw the music video and researched the lyrics that the pain and beauty of this composition reached me. Indeed, the blocking and fighting back towards this abuse with the child's singing, is what stops the cycle of abuse.

Below adapted from the Wikipedia article on the music video (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…:
According to Jewell (the director of the video), the video is about a Bolivian oral legend... a boy he discovers he has a talent for perceiving the problems of people whom he can heal by giving powerful screams like an earthquake or a tornado... he found a disfigured man who was abused and discriminated against by society. This man reveals that he is a prophet cursed by a demon, El Tio, because he stopped adoring him and left the community because it was inhabited by this demon. El Tio is considered the lord of the underworld, to whom mortals give offerings for protection or to soothe his anger. The prophet said that anyone who listens to the devil would fall under his control and that he lives in the desert, where once there was a city that adored him and received a curse, which caused everyone to commit suicide. Together the boy and the old man head towards the residence of the demon, until they reach a mine. There, only the child must deal with the devil, because anyone with intact hearing could be cursed. With his cries he could stop the spirit from cursing other people. The story in the video is unresolved, since the child is left facing the demon, while his companions have gone away.

This is my absolute favourite song out of the album.
My interpretation is that he's singing about discovering his love for this person, just how special they are to him and wanting to spend his life them. He's asking if he can also count on their love, whether their feelings are on the same level as his.

622,Lateralus.json,"
Hey guys, awesome interpretations so far.  Again this is everyone's THOUGHTS, so if I seem to dis anyone or anything by what I say, nothin bad intended.  I think it's great seein what other people think.  Anyway, on to the interpretation.
To begin with, I wanna clear up an earlier post.  Colsy said the title was pronounced ""Lateral-Us"" (A mistake i made too for a long time) but it's really pronounced ""Ladder-alice"" (say it and it makes sense, i found this in the FAQ from toolshed.net). Instead of ""Side of Us"", i think the song deals with lateral parts (the bigger picture, as maynard put it).  Anyway, it deals with the ability to have a physical life, as well as a spiritual one (In whatever god you chose to believe in).
""Black then white are all i see in my infancy"" (at birth and early on you only see what's plain to the human eye, the physical side of life)
""Red and yellow came to be, reaching out for me"" (how spiritual feelings creep up after sometime, and almost seem to make you realize a new side of life)

To keep from breaking down every line in the song (like i did on ""the grudge"") i'll just say that the next section deals with testing spiritual life (pushin that envelope, watching it bend, almost to see how far it will go). spiritual life takes you 'beyond the lines of reason'. 

Yet he retracts these statements by talking about ""OVER thinking, and OVER analyzing"" (saying that there is a balance in spirit and body, don't push either ot the extreme, because you'll become separate humans, leading a LATERAL life)
Then he speaks about reaching out to embrace the random.... possibly spiritual meaning saying that he holds on to a belief hoping that he can eventually find truth in it.
The next part seems to be my strongest point of backing.  he speaks about how he has the desire to do all of these wonderful (spiritual and physical) things, and he sums it all up by saying 
""swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human"" (think about it... the lateral lives of body and spirit NEVER have to each other, they can stay completely separate, but he longs to bring them together, to SPIRAL them, and make such a connection to feel DIVINE but remain a HUMAN.)

Next he backs my statement again.  He speaks of 'keeping his feet on the ground', yet he also talks about an enlightenment of somekind 'opening wide to suck it in and feeling it move across his skin'.
He wants that connection of body and spirit, as everyone does.  He'll continue to connect the 2 to push the boundaries and enlighten himself
""Spiral out, keep going....""

And interpretation is now done, thanks for botherin to read this terribly long post (as are all of mine, sorry bout that).  Anyway, continue writin posts, i love to read em, and again this is only my opinion.  Later...

			i like your interpretation, its along the same lines of what i would have said, just thought id add a few of my thoughts to it.

i think ""over thinking over analyzing seperates the body from the mind"" could mean that as we grow and become more exposed to the logical scientific side of things we lose touch of our spiritual side

also i think "" swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human"" could refer to drunvalo mechizedeks theory of chromosones, we have 44&2 at the moment but as we become more intouch with our spiritual side we gain another 2 chromosones which makes us 46&2 like the other Tool song forty six & 2. these extra 2 cromosones make us divine but the other 44 chromosones are still there which are what makes us human.

			@miml16. Dude, if people label you, then they're douchebags and they don't deserve you and you're time if you're a good person. People label me and look at me as a freak everyday, but I do my best at not letting it get to me. It does, at times, but I know if I keep my eyes on the prize, Heaven or at least the utopia after death, it'll all make sense. I'm ""Christian"", but I have no denomination. All I know is what I need to know. I know that the whole ""higher power"" thing makes absolutely no sense at this point in my life, but I feel it's not supposed to. It wouldn't be called Faith if there was proof.

Basically keep who you are, who you aren't, and where you want to go in your mind and you'll get there. If some things about you need to change, change them. If life was easy it wouldn't be worth living.

			I love your interpretation madson. I have a suggestion if it's not too presumptuous. Read ""The Kybalion"" then the ""Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreunz"" if you haven't already, and I bet you glean even more insight into what Maynard was talking about...specifically the Parabola Allegory;-)			







0








 
			@miml16

My interpretation of that passage is as follows:  I think ""Spiral out, keep going"" may be talking about our DNA as humans and to keep growing (or evolving) to ""go where no ones been"". So as has been said, don't be 2 dimensional. Make your own decisions from within, not what other people tell you to believe, and to keep growing on what you've learned. If everyone believed the same thing, then we wouldn't be any different than robots, which is what the future could hold for us humans unless we can keep evolving. 			







+2








 
			Your interpretation is flawless in terms of everything, I just feel I need to mention something.

The ""Red and Yellow"" may link to something. Recently I have been looking into Blue Oyster Cult and their song ETI. They mention something along the lines of ""King in Yellow, Queen in Red."" I researched this and came up with that the Queen in red is from a Lewis Carol book. Those of you that don't know, he wrote Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. The Queen In Red was from Through the Looking Glass,  her environment around her was always moving, and she had to run in order to keep up with it. This represents the ideology of Evolution and keeping up with the proceeding times. The King in Yellow I read myself, it's a collection of mysterious stories that end up relating to religion and/or social tenancies that are still relevant today. In short, the Red represents ideologies of science and some religion in terms of logic; while the Yellow may represent society and religious influence on a person's personality.

@madson4562 The band is really into sacred geometry so I figured it would make sense to look up the meaning of spiral in sacred geometry. It is actually a symbol of growth without changing shape. So I figured the line ""swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human"" could pertain to growing as a person and becoming more than what you are but remaining a human being (staying in the same form or appearance)

@madson4562 Thank you for the great work you did! I totally agree with your opinion! And particularly with the part when you say that balance and evolution between body and mind makes you feel like a god but still be a human... 

And I would something about this part :

With my feet upon the ground I lose myself
Between the sounds and open wide to suck it in
I feel it move across my skin


I think this part talks about the music itself (not the song, but music in general)... I think it means that music is a good way to push you spiritual side, how powerful it can be if you open your mind and really enters into it. All the emotions you can feel while listening music... in this moments you will totally leave your body and enter into a spiral which could bring you where no one else has been

			I agree with Mediumcore0Tool0Fan when he says he had a Forty Six & 2 moment. I also had a Forty Six & 2 moment. Beyond that, I also came to many of the conclusions madson4562 did. You both created a wonderful interpretation of this song. *thumbs up*			

			Great work Guys Just want u all to see this VId ...... This is the Biggest shock Of My LIFE ....... This song is Mathematically Related as well!!!! & this Vid Proves it!

youtube.com/… 

			imma say it again, 9 years later and half way around the world.... thanks madson4562! this is one of the most important songs in my life rn, and in my 16 years of living this life, i've never heard a song this straight-forward and powerful...but my question has been for a long time...how? how can i become balanced and live afull life when i'm living with the ppl around , and they're labels for me? cuz i obviously cant just take me and put me some where else...that wouldnt even solve anything...this has been my favorite phrase for a long time now, it's written on my wall , but i really want to understand it's true meaning and the way to achieve it: SWING ON THE SPIRAL OF OUR DIVINITY AND STILL BE A HUMAN.. if any ody body has the answer plz guide me...			

			@miml16. Dude, if people label you, then they're douchebags and they don't deserve you and you're time if you're a good person. People label me and look at me as a freak everyday, but I do my best at not letting it get to me. It does, at times, but I know if I keep my eyes on the prize, Heaven or at least the utopia after death, it'll all make sense. I'm ""Christian"", but I have no denomination. All I know is what I need to know. I know that the whole ""higher power"" thing makes absolutely no sense at this point in my life, but I feel it's not supposed to. It wouldn't be called Faith if there was proof.

Basically keep who you are, who you aren't, and where you want to go in your mind and you'll get there. If some things about you need to change, change them. If life was easy it wouldn't be worth living.			

			I love your interpretation madson. I have a suggestion if it's not too presumptuous. Read ""The Kybalion"" then the ""Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreunz"" if you haven't already, and I bet you glean even more insight into what Maynard was talking about...specifically the Parabola Allegory;-)			

			@miml16

My interpretation of that passage is as follows:  I think ""Spiral out, keep going"" may be talking about our DNA as humans and to keep growing (or evolving) to ""go where no ones been"". So as has been said, don't be 2 dimensional. Make your own decisions from within, not what other people tell you to believe, and to keep growing on what you've learned. If everyone believed the same thing, then we wouldn't be any different than robots, which is what the future could hold for us humans unless we can keep evolving. 			

			Your interpretation is flawless in terms of everything, I just feel I need to mention something.

The ""Red and Yellow"" may link to something. Recently I have been looking into Blue Oyster Cult and their song ETI. They mention something along the lines of ""King in Yellow, Queen in Red."" I researched this and came up with that the Queen in red is from a Lewis Carol book. Those of you that don't know, he wrote Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. The Queen In Red was from Through the Looking Glass,  her environment around her was always moving, and she had to run in order to keep up with it. This represents the ideology of Evolution and keeping up with the proceeding times. The King in Yellow I read myself, it's a collection of mysterious stories that end up relating to religion and/or social tenancies that are still relevant today. In short, the Red represents ideologies of science and some religion in terms of logic; while the Yellow may represent society and religious influence on a person's personality. 			

@madson4562 The band is really into sacred geometry so I figured it would make sense to look up the meaning of spiral in sacred geometry. It is actually a symbol of growth without changing shape. So I figured the line ""swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human"" could pertain to growing as a person and becoming more than what you are but remaining a human being (staying in the same form or appearance)			

@madson4562 Thank you for the great work you did! I totally agree with your opinion! And particularly with the part when you say that balance and evolution between body and mind makes you feel like a god but still be a human... 

And I would something about this part :

With my feet upon the ground I lose myself
Between the sounds and open wide to suck it in
I feel it move across my skin


I think this part talks about the music itself (not the song, but music in general)... I think it means that music is a good way to push you spiritual side, how powerful it can be if you open your mind and really enters into it. All the emotions you can feel while listening music... in this moments you will totally leave your body and enter into a spiral which could bring you where no one else has been			

This is one of the most brilliant songs ever written.  Like a complex novel, it operates on many levels, but the central theme of the song is evolution, both personal and on the grand scale.  First we'll examine the music itself.  Note that in the beginning the background beats/rhythms sound almost like a bubbling swamp, which is the source of life.  As the song progresses, those rhythms become more tribal, then more mechanical, till near the end we hear what sounds like robots in a factory.  Thus, the music is about the evolution of the human species to the point where we are either replaced by machines or become machines ourselves.  

Now, the lyrics reinforce this theme on a few ways.  The song starts out: ""Black then white are all I see in my infancy, red and yellow then came to be reaching out to me, let's me see.""  On a very literal level this is exactly how vision evolves in each human.  Babies see in black and white, with their ability to distinguish colors arising as they age.  But this is also true of the human species in a philosophical and spiritual sense.  Edward O. Wilson has written about how the most primitive tribes have words only for black and white; the next most advanced tribes have words for red and yellow, on up to the point where we recognize there is a near infinite color spectrum, which the most advanced cultures recognize.  Thus, the most morally developed beings recognize that issues can never be easily divided into black and white; that's much too simplistic.  There are, of course, people who still see moral issues in black and white, but they are throwbacks to our primitive heritage.  So as technology advances, if we do not evolve morally too, we lose our connection to nature more and more and become little more than machines.  Computers too view things in simplistic black and white terms (or bits and bytes if you prefer).  

Thus, in that context the song is about personal growth--spiritually, morally, and philosophically speaking.  when Maynard sings about pushing the envelope, he is saying that he is attempting to push beyond the 2-dimensional mores and prudish religious nonsense that still holds us back as a culture.  True spiritual growth cannot come from without; it must come from within, and no one else can define what is right or wrong for you.  In that sense this sing is kind of a companion piece to Hermann Hesse's novel 'Demian.'  

As the song approaches its denouement, Maynard approaches something on the order of mystical ecstasy and again the music reinforces the lyrics.  Note how the pitch of Maynard's voice, moving up and down rhythmically, compliments the ""spiral out"" he's singing about.  He leaves the rest ambiguous.  What lies beyond the simplistic black & white world we live in?  Who knows?  But the point is, we must push ahead anyway, no matter what, because the alternative is that we're no better than the machines we build to labor for us.  We MUST stop looking at the world as if it can be divided into easy categories.  The truth is never that simple.  We may not like what we find as we move on; nevertheless, we advance or we die, spiritually speaking.

Please enlighten the masses on how we are a ""prudish"" society that is held back. LOL. Due to all our freedoms, we have a lovely share of disease; abortion; adultry; greed; sloth; theft; lonliness; addiction; etc. Seems to me we haven't been held back, but would be much better off if we had some restraint, which God has suggested (and shown to be good for us). We just never listen, and I gather that Maynard embraced the ""mystical"" too much...and probably the booze.

			God does not exist, at least not in any form that can be quantified.  The fact that a large part of society still hasn't accepted this fact is the source of much conflict.  How many modern wars do you know of that don't have religion or ideology at the heart of them?  Anyway, the vices you list have always existed, even under the theocratic rule of the Church.  Read your history.  These things will always exist because we are animals at heart and have animal needs.  

Moreover, you misunderstand my point.  I am not saying the song justifies an 'anything goes for everyone' society; I certainly don't.  What the song is saying, I think (and I agree with this), is that everyone must find his own path to inner balance and enlightenment.  There is no one-size-fits-all spirituality or morality, and the fact that we still have all these organized religions telling us we have to live such-and-such a way and tons of stupid laws against victimless crimes demonstrates that we ARE still being held back.  Not everyone can use drugs without becoming addicted, but some people can and can find enlightenment that way.  And too many people are still judgmental about alternative sexualities, lifestyles, etc.  That social judgment and cultural disapproval does hold some people back, because believe it or not, not everyone is apathetic enough not to care what society thinks of them and thus sadly never reach their full potential.  

Perhaps I am speaking out of my ""skinny arse"" and perhaps not.  This site solicits opinions about the meanings of song lyrics.  I gave mine.  That you replied so obnoxiously is precisely what I've come to expect from so-called religious people and merely reinforces my point about who is truly enlightened and who isn't.

			Starwatcher, thank you for such an intricate analysis, I never considered this song as you describe. However, despite religious beliefs or societal adherence to moral restrictions, are you suggesting abandonment of reason as being the evolutionary culprit of advancement? I would consider the ability to reason and a precise evaluation of consequences rendered from erroneous actions to be responsible for progress and not for the mere persuit of. Your synopsis of the linguistic element is profound and definitely a big high five, but also it is thought that the discovery of fire by our primitive ancestors actually is responsible for increasing the size of the brain as artifacts of both validate the time line. Would this be a homonoid seeking progress, or using or using reason? More an example of revolutionizing the envelope secondary to utilization via reason and not the pushit approach the arrived us to present day, but just a thought. Thanks for a conjurinistic  view for a very merry Christmas! ;) 

P.S. conjurinistic isn't a word, but sure sounds nice...LOL.

			You're welcome.  No, I don't reject reason at all.  Quite the contrary.  Reason is necessary for advancement, but by the same token, surrendering entirely to reason would cause us to lose our humanity as well.  We as a society and as individuals must strike a balance, but doing so is no easy process.  In fact, I believe it's something we have to work for all our lives, because the moment we think we have all the answers, they collapse in front of us like a house of cards.  Very Taoist of me, no? :) 

We cannot find all the answers in one source or another, one philosophy, one kind of thinking or belief system.  That is why this song remains purposely ambiguous.  There are no easy answers, and in the process of exploration and change we may destroy ourselves, or become something other than human, but we must press on, because to become stagnant as a culture (or as an individual) is a kind of death.  We cannot allow simplistic or oppressive ideologies or philosophies to hold us back.

2nd This song is absolutley beautiful. It is a life story wrapped into a 3 or 4 minute song. I love this song because its got very beautiful lyrics and beautiful melody to it.
Jason Aldean writes about things he knows and this song he really knows. 
The video was awesome! Every word in the song was portrayed in the video absolutley perfect. and the way he  put his daughter in the last shot when he was talking about how he and his wife had been waiting so lon and then she came along was perfect!!  She is so cute!
by the way Jason Congrats on the new baby girl in your house and try to get some sleep will you!

I like how he applied ""oh man, we..."" to three different situations. My favorite part has to be when he found out his wife was pregnant. ""I remember you comin' in and tellin' me the news. Oh man, we were living, goin crazy in the kitchen."" I can picture this and it sounds fabulous.

6 months ago I had to leave the country and also leave my boyfriend. When we started dating we knew that I was leaving but we said that we would be prepared when the moment came and we would just break up and be friends. But it was not that simple, I just miss him so much, we talk everyday but we know that I'm not coming soon, we would have to wait 6 o 7 years to be together again and being in a relationship with so little hopes is too hard. He said that he didn't want a long distance relationship because he had one before and it turned out wrong. But we're having a long distance relationship despite that fact, even when we haven't said so. It's terribly hard to leave behind the person you love. And I hope that one day I'll be there, where I was, right next to him.

What's in my mind when I listen to this song,

Baby,

You seem so close even tho you're so far away, it's like I can touch you but really all it was just a shadow. You're gone, I know that I have to accept the fact of not being able to be with you. How much I miss you say 'I love you' near my ears, you're breathing so close, your heart pound so close that I can feel you - feel you close and closer.

I'm screaming, baby, I'm kicking myself remembering how much time I have wasted not being with you. I'm crying, louder and louder, can you hear me when I call to you? How can you when you're so far away.

Are you alright? Are you taking good care of yourself when I'm not there with you. You're like an angel that I can feel your presence but I can't see you, how I wish I could see you.

Remember when I lay down beside you and how you would hold me tighter and tighter? If I could and I would, do whatever I can to see you.

This song is about a relationship that ended. It could be that the woman was not ready to be in a committed relationship or she had to leave him for x reason. He believes that one day they will be back together. When she broke up with him, she told him not to cry when she was gone. Life doesn't make sense without her and he misses her. He wants to let her know how hurt he is from her decision of leaving him and how he wishes he could be back together.

The first time I read the lyrics to this song I thought they were condemning Christianity and religion in general, now that I reread them, however, they seem to be talking solely about corrupt churches with corrupt ministers, and not condemning Christianity as a whole. I'm suddenly reminded of hearing a story about how sometime in the 80s there was a preacher saying that God told him he would die if he didn't get one million dollars from his church. Ozzy Osbourne then sent the preacher a gun.

@ViLeMetal 















The song, according to an interview with Metallica in the 80s, was written as a direct outcome of the televangelism scandal, where millions were given to two ministers who used it for their own personal gain rather than that of the church. The song reflects the control that religion, in specific, the Christian Church, has upon millions of people. They blindly follow their preachers and the story of a man who lived two thousand years ago, doing whatever their abstract lord says. I could go on with this for hours, but I won't, as this is not the place to do so. I was a member of the brainwashed elite for quite some time, but I've been questioning for quite awhile. A year or so ago, I left the Church and all organized religion behind and became agnostic. It remains as the best decision I've made in my life. This song reminds me of the chains I left behind.

			i agree with you on this one. People have holes that only religion can fill. But when something bad happens they often leave their religious pathes. and then some guy comes around says he'll make everything better just by drinking his ""Kool-Aid""			

Traditionally, a leper messiah was someone who was brave enough to preach to the lepers. Leprosy was feared greatly and lepers were ostracized and sent to live by themselves. Most priests feared these colonies and refused to have anything to do with them.

In context of these lyrics, the phrase takes on a slightly different meaning. Metallica, specifically, uses the phrase to refer priests and preachers who use religion to appeal to those who feel disenfranchised and alone. However, they don't use religion to make these people feel better, instead they guilt them into donating money. The term is not used with fondness in the lyrics. Most people see these fly by night preachers as little better than con artists.

Metallica is my favourite band, even though I am a Christian, which some people may find hard to believe. When I heard this song and ""The God That Failed"", I wanted to know why these songs were written, whether they had meaning or were just sticking their finger up at God. When I found out what the song ""The God That Failed"" meant, I felt quite bad as I felt I wrongly judged them. The same with this song, I thought it was taking the pee out of Jesus, saying that he was wrongly healing the lepers, now I know that it was about the       false prophets, I feel better about the band.

			Yeah, I'm pretty sure that this song is about religious nuts who preach about doing something that they want you to do in order to make it to heaven, Instead of going by what the bible says. I'm talking about people like the space ship death case, Jim jones, David koresh, People like that are leper messiahs. The use God in a negative manner.

If you are an atheist, or agnotic, please read this and honestly give it some thought...

Your belief that there is no God, or belief that there is nothing, is just as much of an act of faith as a Christian's belief IN God.  Just as a christian cannot ""prove"" the exitence of God, an atheist cannot prove that there is NO God.  Are you 100% sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no heaven, hell, or afterlife when you die?  Have you been dead?  You belive whatever you believe based on faith.  Faith that you are right.  Faith that whatever knowledge and facts you used to ascertain your conclusion is correct.  So there is no need to call anyone ""mindless"", or ""morons"" for practicing their faith, when that is exactly the same thing that the atheist is doing. Do you know everything there is to know?  If so, you would know the intimate details of the sex life of Napolian's great-grandmother's black cat's fleas.  With that as a baseline, would you say you maybe knew 1% of everthing there is to know? or even 1% of 1%?  I'm just saying it would be good that you be pretty knowledgeable before you go betting your eternity on what you know, or worse, what you don't know.

If you're a logical thinker and an atheist, I challenge you to read, ""God doesn't believe in Atheists"".  It's filled with logical examples like this. Atheists are nothing if not logical thinkers, and this book really appeals to that kind of reader.  In fact, if you are not quite sure what you are sure of regarding your belief in God and would like a copy of that book, email me at gsjones1234@gmail.com with your address or po box or whatever, and I will buy a copy from Amazon and have it sent to you, no questions asked.  If only one person receives the greatest gift God ever gave us through this, then it will have been worth the money. 

For the record guys, Christianity is not about thinking you're better than anyone, or judging anyone for their sins, or trying to gather up $ from mindless masses.  PEOPLE do that.  Jesus did not like organized religeon for this very reason.  It's not God's fault when humans do evil in the name of God.  Don't condemn yourself to an eternal life away from God because you associate Him with the evil that men have done in the name of religion. 

We're all sinners. It's human.  You can't be a good enough person to just go to heaven because you're a good guy.  It doesn't work like that.  That is not a good ""fall-back"" plan if you happen to be wrong about the whole atheism thing.  Have you ever been wrong about anything?  As much as heaven is a real place, so if hell. You need to be right about this.

The good news is that it doesn't cost a thing.  No payments to the ""Leper Messiah"" lol.  You just have to repent, and believe.  That's it.  Free as the air you breathe. Pretty good deal, especially when you consider the alternative.  It's all in the book mentioned above.  I was serious about that offer if anyone is still reading this board.  Maybe you're reading this for a reason.  I did not plan to come here to write all this.  Just seemed like there was a surprisingly large atheist majority here to speak to I guess.

			Ten reasons why I do not believe in God
1. Light
2. Pi
3. The fact that God was the one who created sin
4. Evolution
5. Midgets
6. Fossils
7. Isotopes and all radioactive atoms
8. Testicles(actually it is why they are so damn irritating and weak)
9. Gravity
10. DNA

Think about these ten reasons without reaching the stupid christian answer:
""God works in mysterious ways""
That's christian and means ""Ohh shit I'm losing... Look over there"" and then run away.

I don't care whether or not you believe me but just think about it. Okay?

			But you're the one that believes something which was believed by people 6,000 years ago. People back then were pretty easy to scare with 'Listen to me, I have this book! Which says how we have to live! And if you don't live like this and don't believe in my God, your soul shall be tortured for eternity when you are dead!

As for the reply by terosan, I fail to see how light, Pi, evolution (proven incorrect anyway), midgets (lol), Fossils, Isotopes etc, testes (what the?), gravity (it sucks by the way...) have to do with why someone should not beleive in God.. As for God creating sin? Nah, he gave man free will and we chose to disobey God, so man created sin not God and DNA? well that's been proven to be similar to a programmed code of sorts which could never have occured by a step-by-step evolutionary process, so who programmed our DNA? God? a higher intellegence? Hmmm.... gets you thinking ay?

Ps, dont beleive what you read or are told. Do your own investigations and work it out for yourself. The answer is simple then.

			Ten reasons why I do not believe in God
1. Light
2. Pi
3. The fact that God was the one who created sin
4. Evolution
5. Midgets
6. Fossils
7. Isotopes and all radioactive atoms
8. Testicles(actually it is why they are so damn irritating and weak)
9. Gravity
10. DNA

Think about these ten reasons without reaching the stupid christian answer:
""God works in mysterious ways""
That's christian and means ""Ohh shit I'm losing... Look over there"" and then run away.

I don't care whether or not you believe me but just think about it. Okay?


			But you're the one that believes something which was believed by people 6,000 years ago. People back then were pretty easy to scare with 'Listen to me, I have this book! Which says how we have to live! And if you don't live like this and don't believe in my God, your soul shall be tortured for eternity when you are dead! Now give me your money, so that you will not live your life in hell!""

This song is not anti-god.  It's just about the corruption of religion.  God is a personal thing that some people choose to have faith in.  Metallica is talking about evil people who exploit the concept of god for personal profit, turning it into a business and a way to control people.

"
634,Let It Be.json,"
McCartney: One night during this tense time I had a dream I saw my mum, who’d been dead 10 years or so. And it was so great to see her because that’s a wonderful ting about dreams: you actually are reunited with that person for a second; there they are and you appear to both be physically together again. It was so wonderful for me and she was very reassuring. In the dream she said, ‘It’ll be all right.’ I’m not sure if she used the words ‘Let it be’ but that was the gist of her advice, it was, ‘Don’t worry too much, it will turn out OK.’ It was such a sweet dream I woke up thinking, Oh, it was really great to visit with her again. I felt very blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing the song “Let It Be.” I literally started off ‘Mother Mary’, which was her name, ‘When I find myself in times of trouble’, which I certainly found myself in. The song was based on that dream.

McCartney: Mother Mary makes it a quasi-religious thing, so you can take it that way. I don’t mind. I’m quite happy if people want to use it to shore up their faith. I have no problem with that. I think it’s a great thing to have faith of any sort, particularly in the world we live in.

Lennon: That’s Paul. What can you say? Nothing to do with the Beatles. It could’ve been Wings. I don’t know what he’s thinking when he writes “Let It Be.” I think it was inspired by “Bridge Over Troubled Water.” That’s my feeling, although I have nothing to go on. I know he wanted to write a “Bridge Over Troubled Water.”

(It should be noted that John was way off here because “Let It Be” was actually recorded well before “Bridge Over Troubled Water” was released. Also I think George’s beautiful guitar solo is an important part of the song. I sense jealousy in this quote.)

			Good point about this being about Paul's mother.  However, your statement about John's being way off might not be correct.   ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" was released as a single in January 1970.  ""Let It Be"" was released in March of 1970.

@LisaPetrolo I know this is nearly five years after your post and maybe it has been noted elsewhere. A rare demo of Let It Be was recorded in the summer of 1968 and was included on the deluxe edition of The Beatles aka The ""White Album"", which was recently released November 2018 to mark the LP's 50th anniversary. So after all these nearly 5 years we can conclude “Let it be” was written and recorded nearly 2 years before “Bridge Over Troubled Water” was released.

My interpretation is that you can't control people or situations, even if you desperately want to, and for what may feel very good reason. In relationships we may want to fix or change things, but no matter how much love and communication is given, you cannot change people or control their sometimes shitty and weak choices.

 After struggling to hold everything together for too long, you finally realise, you actually have no control and that you just have to 'let it be"". It's out of your hands.

Faith gets you through these times ~knowing that you can and will be okay whatever outcome.

And when the night is cloudy(When u are going thru something..when everythign just seems rong), There is still a light that shines on me, shine on till tommorow..(If ulook hard enuff u'll find something good...the light is always shinning on u..even during the darkest times),

I think like all music, poetry, or art, this song has different meanings to different people. That's the real purpose of any art, I think, is to connect with others. McCartney may very well have meant his mother, or he may have meant Mother Mary, but I think he probably meant both. It is a simple, beautiful song. Nothing really fancy about it. That's what makes is such a great song........and it IS a GREAT song.

Justin here is trying to talk about the relationship that he used to be in but has fallen apart. Though he clearly admits that the relationship was hard but it was worth it

Dont fall asleep at the wheel
We've got a million miles ahead of us

The singer is trying to make his lover know that the loo ife is hard but they still got to look it in positive contrast and continue because there are mamy things that could be better if they stay together

I’ve read that he lost his mother to an overdose at a younger age. Some say these lyrics are from his father to him. I’m a way I say that’s true just from a somewhat different stand point. In the video the father is just watching this kid drown, I’m guessing that him trying to impress his father, and he just stands there watching. Toward the end of the video the father lifts open a casket in the ground and it’s his son in there and he breaks down to his knees. So I’m my opinion this is some one talking when it’s too late. It’s an open apology to whoever the person is.

@Fight4thecure 















2018 is the year of songs about teen angst. In this song, the son just keeps repeating how sorry he is to have disappointed and let his parents down. They clearly have a rocky relationship, as the singer talks about how his parents are always lecturing him and yelling at him, but the fights are never resolved -- they only end in his parents wanting an apology, an experience that I find personally to be all too real. As is usual for many children raised in abusive households, even after he moves out of his house, there's still no reprieve. The song doesn't get any lighter or happier, the singer is still tormented by the shadows of his past. His parents have forever ruined the chance to have a relationship with him, because he is still too haunted by his memories of how they used to treat him to stand to be around them. But that doesn't matter, because no matter what, he is still riddled with guilt about all of the times they told him that he let them down.

This song finds NF addressing a girlfriend who is telling lies about him behind his back.

I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that, how you gonna lie like that?

Though the girl apparently wants the relationship to continue, NF is fed up with the false accusations and what they're doing to his reputation.
""Lie"" is about an actual former girlfriend of NF but he doesn't mention her name as the rapper doesn't want to publicly embarrass the woman. NF learned from the experience and was happily married to someone else when he released the song.
NF wrote the song with:

Mike Elizondo, who is best known for his work with such rappers as Eminem, 50 Cent and Dr. Dre. The Los Angeles producer and songwriter has also worked with artists in a diverse range of other genres including Avenged Sevenfold, Regina Spektor, Maroon 5 and Carrie Underwood. 

Michigan songwriter and producer Tommee Profitt, who worked on 13 of the Perception tracks. He's also remixed for such artists as Colton Dixon, and Britt Nicole, under the name PRO_FITT.

647,Lighters (feat. Bruno Mars).json,"
This song is by far in my opinion, one of the greatest written songs that I have seen.  Eminem has some really great stuff, but this is just pure genius.

Both rappers are pretty clear about what they are trying to say, but there are some hidden messages for those who can't see them.

Eminem : 

He starts off by saying by the time anyone hears this he would have already spiraled up.  In other words, by the time anyone knows whats going on, he is on his way to the top.  Like a virus spreading, he is going to set the world on fire.  In a good way of course.

Then he says to those who weren't on his side, to watch out.  They better duck, or they are going to get struck down hard.  I believe when he says fighters, he is talking to his fans.  ""Fighters out your lighters up point them skyward""  Perhaps lighters symbolizes fists?

Obviously he had a dream that he was king, and when he woke up, nothing changed.  He is on top of the hill, and no one can touch him.  He gives people the chance to disagree, but then says that it doesn't matter because he isn't going to make any excuses.  He is going to come out on top, and not you or anyone can stop him.

He talks about being cocky, and how he has to be.  P. Diddy talks about that in an interview once, how he had/has to believe he is the baddest mother F**ker in the game.  there is no option, this may be referencing that.  When your cocky, you believe that you are the best.  In order to do that, you need to believe in yourself, and what you are trying to accomplish.  When he references other people being slick, he is talking about them lying in their raps.  Rapping about things that aren't true to their heart, perhaps just for ratings/money.  Not sure who he is talking about, if anyone in particular.  

the rest of Eminem he is talking about how he was in a dark place, and came back from it.  Kind of like he talked about in Not Afraid a little bit at the end.  It's pretty amazing how he described it.  True artist.

Royce : 

As for Royce, his rap has a different viewpoint.  He talks quickly about making a lot of money, and being successful.  With the Iron man Audi reference, but then he thanks Eminem for helping him out, like Dr. Dre did for Eminem.  Then he spends a good deal of time talking about his father.  I think this is the coolest part.  He says he wants to make enough money to retire his dad, since his father's back is bad.  

He then follows in Eminem's footsteps, and tells people that he is going straight to the top, and that no one is going to stop him.  He doesn't do it like Eminem, but if he sticks with Em, I'm sure we will be hearing a lot more from him!

As for Bruno Mars...I don't know aha.  Not a huge fan of him, although I don't mind him in this song.  Good touch to it.

			I really like your interpretation. Some of those little facts (like the P Diddy thing) I wasn't aware of. I think you kind of missed a part of it, though - atleast in my opinion. Both rappers use many drug references. I think a big message that they're conveying is getting out of that and bringing it up to be where they are now. I think that kind of ties to lighters into it. Like, instead of lighting drugs, let's use our lighters to make light for everyone else in the dark. As for Bruno Mars, I think he's just kind of there to make it a little softer. The intensity of the lyrics here is almost over the top. Adding Bruno Mars in is like putting a little pillow down for your head instead of laying it on a hard surface. He's rpetty much just saying, ""We've finally got things how they need to be. Thank God. Now let's see those lighters and make thing even more bright."" That's how I see it, anyway.

""Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Poppin shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-of-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks""

p.s. this is pure lyrical brilliance. Eminem is crazy good. Don't piss him off or he'll rip you to shreds.

i agree with everybody's interpretation of the rap section, and i think i pulled a meaning out of Bruno Mars. I think that he is continuing on what Eminem has said about his climb to the top and now he is at the top of his career.

""You and I know what itï¿½s like to be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight weï¿½re alright""

he had many struggles that may have set him back and needed to get back to the top, but he made it and now he's living his dream.

There are alot of ways to perceive this song as what to be. I got to agree that this song is really good.

The song has a double meaning. The girl as his fans and the sex referring to his popular songs such as, No Role Modelz, Work Out, Etc. While trying to show the real world with songs like Rich Niggaz, Love Yourz, Break Down, etc. the girl (his fans) always seems to be nieve when talking about the real world. Since the sex (popular songs) seems to relieve him of his pain,""for now everything just seems so right, and how you make the darkness seem so bright"", he always seems to give in.

The song is basically about the rap wars and how much the danger of being hurt or killed by your rivals is highly possible. Eminem sings a little about most of his feuds with multiple artists and the video is just what could possibly happen to someone from his crew due to all of the fighting between the groups. The person that dies in the video actually dies 2 years later after the song was made. He was shot in a bar after shooting someone over a game of pool.

There are some people that he has named, I will try to clarify the situation.

Benzino is an older rapper, whom had control over Source magazine for a while and used it to bash on Eminem and even made a new album with a lot of songs directed to Eminem and I'm assuming that Eminem believed Benzino was irrelevant to everything that was going on and decided to try to be on top of the rap game by starting drama with him.

50 Cent's feud is said to be started in his words that Ja Rule was robbed out of his jewelry and Ja Rule thought 50 Cent had something to do with it and Ja Rule said that 50 Cent was jealous over the fact that when he was making videos in his 'hood, he got a lot of love from the people there. That's when they started to make diss song at each other with Ja Rule and Murder Inc artists and 50 Cent with his G-Unit. 50 Cent was nearly killed after being shot 9 times. It's said that a local drug kingpin sent the hit after 50 Cent made an album that exposed Murder Inc's illegal activties with the said drug dealer. It's also believed that the same drug dealer killed Jam Master Jay for helping out 50 Cent make and send the album and pretty much taught 50 Cent how to actually make music. 50 Cent later joined in Eminem's record label and Ja Rule threatened Eminem and Dre to not make any diss songs about him and they didn't until Dre produced a 50 Cent song that pretty much destroyed Ja Rule and his family and that's when Ja Rule came out with ''Loose Change'' and it was directed to Dre and Eminem and people from their labels and that's when Eminem/D12, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent/G-Unit battled Ja Rule/Murder Inc and other artists for a while. There was a time where Dre and Eminem talked with 50 Cent to try kill the drama with Ja Rule, but Ja Rule was talking and joking about how he was the one that stabbed 50 Cent in a club and that continued the fued. It was actually Black Child from Murder Inc that stabbed 50 Cent because he thought he was pulling out a gun.

Now to the Suge Knight thing. Eminem wasn't afraid of Suge Knight, he just didn't attack Suge Knight out of respect for his friend Dr. Dre who told him to stay out of it because it wasn't his beef and wanted to do things by himself.

@Acid Christ 















I don't usually listen to Eminem, but these lyrics are so raw and real I just had to comment. He talks about trying to be the responsible person in a world of immature rappers. He doesn't want to lose his temper but when the people he cherishes the most are involved then it's war. He just sounds so mature, and I like how with this song he basically says how he knows what's right from wrong but he will fight to the end for his loved ones. Good job, E!

to can u keep up 
why do you hate eminem so much? He is making something of his life. He is trying to create something good out of something that was bad. How can you rank on someone for that? A lot of people like his music so he is good for something. He is not out there shooting people or throwing away his life. He's speaking out against it. Some communities are not in very good condition and we need people like eminem to inspire people and have something to hang on to. What we don't need is blind hate. You look completely one sided. Maybe you should open up your mind. I am not saying you have to like it but at least respect it. Its art don't trash it.

True... maybe not the greatest music out there... but then again, what is? It all depends on your mood, I'm Dominican and have been listening to reggaetton since the old days when only underground stuff used to come out, nobody thought it was going to make this big a boom, and I myself was reluctant at first to accept the transition of the genre, but u know what... I really enjoy it, and it's not really the artists fault that the genre has reached such high levels of acceptance between communities, enjoy the music, dance to it. if you don't like it then don't waste your time posting here or hearing it! do yourselves a favor... :)

 and this song is not about sex...is about a guy saying to his exgirlfriend 'hey, we are through , face it . its over. you cheated and im not gonna take it etc

Here's to a new life and a sucky past that should have been buried a long, long time ago. Cheers to me!

			Oh, the song is about sex. Damn good sex.			






			Oh, the song is about sex. Damn good sex.			

The lead single from singer-songwriter Bruno Mars' sophomore album, Unorthodox Jukebox, features production by Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, Emile Haynie and the songwriting/production team the Smeezingtons (Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine). The song finds Mars singing of a relationship that is so good the narrator feels like he was ""locked out of heaven"" before he met his lover. It debuted digitally and on radio on October 1, 2012 and became available for purchase the following day.


During his Google+ Hangout on the day of the song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase ""But swimming in your water is something spiritual,"" and later said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the ""sensual, sensual and sensual"" theme of the album.


Though critics have been quick to point out the song's similarities to some of the hits by the Police, Mars told MTV News he did not set out to write anything inspired by the Sting-fronted band. Instead, it came to him out of the blue, one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album. ""I don't think it initially tried to sound like anybody else, but I picked up the guitar and just started playing [the song's opening chords],"" Mars explained. ""That's how it normally works; I'll pick up a guitar and I'll start humming a melody, and I started singing that, and I was up there in Sting-ville, in that register, so that's what you get... I tend to listen to a lot of guys with higher registers - Sting being one of them, Freddie Mercury, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder - because I've got a high voice.""


The song's stripped back music video was directed by Cameron Duddy, who also helmed the clip for Mars ' ""The Lazy Song."" The retro visual mainly features the singer performing the track in a club, with a few added VHS effects. ""The concept is just old-fashioned fun. No story line, it's not me singing to a girl, you get a good sense of what you're going to get live,"" explained Mars to MTV News. ""It's very VHS-y. I love that man, it takes me back to my childhood, when the tracking is off and the color is off, there's a beauty in that. You'd have to stand by the TV with, like, aluminum foil all over you.""


Bruno Mars performed the song live for the first time when he hosted and did double duty as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live, October 20, 2012.

As someone else stated it is about sex ... the best sex ever. So good in fact that they feel they've been ""locked out of heaven"" (ecstasy, nirvana, Elysium etc.) because they haven't experienced it before.

The lyrics aren't as crass as many other songs out there, a little bit more subtle (although still quite unsubtle).

			No, he really isn't. Rihanna is far more successful than him & makes considerably more as her music sells better AND she makes millions with dozens of companies whose products she advertises. Women get to do beauty product ads so they generally make more at the end of the day if they're successful.

That line was to us - well not ALL of us, but the average-wage-making ""haters"" amidst his average-wage-making fans.

Upon first listen it does in fact sound like a song about a casual one night stand, but the more I listen to it and read the lyrics it seems more to me like a song about not putting so much pressure on a relationship from the start like most of us do. If you read the bridge you can understand what i'm talking about. ""but you never say never in life"" seems like admitting it could happen but saying ""lets just not worry about that right now"".

Eminem is very talented in what he does and how he sings. He gets his message accross to the people the best way he knows how.

Honestly neither sound correct. It's the only line that doesn't seem right somehow. Maybe it's ""But I kept rhymin in step, writing the next cypher""

			the sad thing is on loads of his songs he says about not being able to sing even though he's got a really good singing voice, and also in response to anyone who say people who can't sing rap, Ed Sheeran is amazing at both			

This song really means alot to me because its about how Eminem went through life and rose to stardom only to realize thats its not all he ever wanted.
These next lines are the most important lines in the song I believe

Too much for me to want to
Stay in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot

These lines are saying that he is realizing that he is becoming stuck in his position and he doesn't like where he is at. He goes through his motions in an attempt to break out of the system in which he is becoming trapped. Any plan that he would make has to be a safe plan because he does not want to be killed or go to jail over it so he is thinking on what options are out there to get away from everything and go back to the old times. He is saying that he is a snail because he doesn't enjoy what he is doing and feels like his life is going by to slow for his liking.

The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin', but superstardom's close to post-mortem


Anyone else find these lyrics creepy and out of the ordinary?
Hes talking about selling his soul for the music industry saying superstars are practically dead because they have no souls.

The singer is reflecting on a relationship that is failing or challenged.  

She's trying to shine light to her lover on wisdom regarding what it takes to invest into a relationship and if that investment is not recognized, how that is an indication of how her sacrifices and work is lost on"" the person she loves. 

""all I ever wanted was you"" --- no games.
""ill never get to heaven cause i dont know how"" -- even though she did right by her lover, it didn't work. 
""lets raise a glass or two"" -- celebrating life / distracting herself while feeling heartbroken

She also reflects on wanting to know more about her lover and her expectations; what are the mappings of her mind are.  She's lost and confused about what her partner thinks and feels, but yet hopeful -- ""we can turn this around"".

""Just think you can cut me loose?""  ... She is reaffirming that she isn't someone that can just be discarded or toy'd with  I think it's also that her lover may need to recognize how much she's depended on her.  

Overall, the song is a tug of war between her love/lover and her willingness to survive her disappointment.

This is clearly a song written from cole's own experience. He really puts a lot of emotion in the song when he sings,  especially when he sings "" i cry sometimes about""  Personaly, i love this song because it shows exactly how some men act when they end up in situations like this. cole admits to having acted in that way but his point of view changes and he realises that even if the child isnt his its his reponsability as a man to care for it ""but what about your seed nigga?"".

@bublelover8705 















i can completely relate to this song. its almost like there are two people who were in love once, and it just didnt work out at the time. but now, they are past their troubles and are just promising to be there for each other.

""I can't believe it's over
I watched the whole thing fall
And I never saw the right man was on the wall
If I don't land
Days were slipping past
That the good things never last
That you were crying""
they broke up, and he didn't do anything. he didnt see how she was hurting, he just let it slip by and didn't step up and become the man he should have been

he says ""I hardly recognized the girl you are today
And god I hope it's not too late""
and i think it means that she is different than when they were together, but he still wants to be friends and be there for her, like when he sings
""'Cause you are not alone
And I am there with you
And we'll get lost together""
he's offering her that escape again, offering to be there whether its as a friend or something more

i absolutely love this song, it completely relates to me and his voice is just amazing. it makes me cry

This song is definitely about sex. Rough sex in particular. He can't get her to orgasm so she's telling him she needs him to be rough with her. 

I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain"" 

She also describes how he'll know it's working.

""And if in the moment I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this
Is something bigger than us and beyond bliss""

He replies telling her he'll do it, bang her so hard and deep that she'll feel like she's loosing her virginity again (for those who don't know, that's pretty painful).

""And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make it feel like the first time""

She also tells him that if he can't get her there that she'll leave him.

""what do I do if I can't figure it out?
You got to try, try, try again
So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
I'm gonna leave, leave, leave""

Not such a Disney princess anymore eh?

Definitely about Mary Austin.

It's such a sweet song, really. The lines ""When I grow older, I will be there by your side to remind you, How I still love you -I still love you"" are perhaps the most incredible lyrics he ever wrote because he made the promise, and kept it through to the end.

Mary was so lucky to have such a dedicated man who reminded her of the truth at the end of his life. It really takes someone to do that.

@njdev this will get more notice, as people see the movie.  You can sense the longing of a bi-sexual man marrying the woman he loves, but for whom cannot consume his feelings. Freddie learned the Harp just for this song.  Says quite a bit about his unrequited passion for Mary - and the pain of knowing why she must leave.

I watched a documentary about Queen, and Brian May said this song was about Freddie's love for Mary Austin. Wheter it was about being best friends or lovers really doesn't matter (can anyone define the difference anyway?), because Freddie have stated several times that she was the love of his life and his only true friend. She stayed with him till the end. Beautiful song anyway.

This is a great ballad!!  Expression great pain...waves of sadness..... and accompanied with fantastic melody. I was blown away when I heard this song for the first time (and it wasn't Queen, but a Scorpions cover, ref: Acoustica CD, track #12).  I think the song is about a strong, but broken relationship....and going through the emotional hardship in repairing the damage that she has caused.....and as you approach completing the reconciliation process.....but, at the end of the day, she abandons him anyway!  .....The feeling of abandonment comes with great sorrow and pain...wouldn't you agree?

I have always assumed this song was about Freddie's relationship with Mary Austin.  Yes, I know he was gay, but he lived with Mary for several years, and in interviews said she was the ""love of his life.""  Mary said she felt they had a marriage, that they were always there for each other till the end.  She cared for him when he was dying.  He left her the bulk of his estate in his will.  She is the first person he lists in his dedications for the album ""Barcelona"" which he did without Queen.

This is a magnificent song and a great backstory.

Once upon a time there lived a sad young boy
One day he met a very beautiful girl who opened up to him
And he opened up to her
For a while they saw each other every day
But somewhere along the line they stopped
And he did nothing
And she started visiting him again, every sunday
But one day she stopped again
And he never thought she was seeing if he'd come to her
He just figured she no longer cared

Maybe she didn't

But either way that boy is sorry now.

690,Love The Way You Lie (feat. Rihanna).json,"
It's about two people who meet and fall in love, however, as time goes on, they start to resent each other and the man becomes physically abusive. The woman takes it at first, but then she tries to leave him. He promises her that he'll never hurt her again and he'll try to control his temper, but he's lying. He says that if she ever tried to leave again, he'd kill her. The woman knows that this is all just a lie, but she keeps going back to him because she loves him.

I think this song is especially powerful since Rihanna knows exactly what she is singing, due to her relationship with Chris Brown.

			I was in a relationship JUST LIKE this one. He was physically abusive, but only because he was stronger. We both had tempers. We'd fight and then he'd promise to never hurt me again and I'd go back - there's something to be said about a man that loves you so much he hurts you.

But that's alright because I like the way it hurts. She's being sarcastic.

Just gonna stand there and hear me cry. To her, a good God can't watch you burn in hell...he should deiever you.
But that's alright because I love the way you lie...Calling him a lier when he said ""call upon me the day of trouble and i'll deliver you"" once u'r in hell, its too late.

I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

THIS WHOLE SONG IS A TOTAL INSULT TO GOD AND CALLING HIM A LIER. RIHANNA AND EMINEM ARE ALL CALLING GOD A LIER, INSULTING HIM AND RIDICULLING HIM AND PUTTING IT IN A FORM OF A LOVE SONG. DON'T SING WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW, U CAN BE EASILY MISLEADED. TRUST ME I KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

Great song, obviously about a both verbal and physically abusive relationship and how it seems the guy will say anything to keep his girl with him even though he's just spewing lies. Eminem is one of the few rappers I have strong respect for, he keeps it real. I adore the last set of verses the most, awesome lyrics and it makes the song even better with Rihanna singing the chorus considering her experience with abuse.

There is domestic violence where the abuser who has no remorse and the victim, who at 1st thinks it is love but later realizes the other person is just abusive & really wants to leave the other but is afraid of what the other will do to them or their children if they do leave.. then there is the other.. 

and to me this is what Eminem is addressing, the dynamic of a relationship when 2 people have the most TOXIC LOVE imaginable for one another. They victimize the other person as well as themselves. They are both victims as well as guilty of being literally crazy for one another. I hope people dont have to experience this type of relationship but if you do I believe you go through it once. It's hard to truly understand unless you have been through it but the song as well as the video paints the picture of the turmoil that the extremity of emotions and how it is handled effect the people in these relationships. What they go through and what happens when they have no control of those emotions. You see what they are willing to endure for one another because no matter how bad it gets nothing seems worst then leaving each other. Their destructive relationship is a contradiction of what love should be but they truly are madly in love, Its heartbreaking...


- ""And I love it the more that I suffer. I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown she resuscitates me. She fucking hates me and I love it."" 
- ""Just gonna stand there and watch me burn. But that's alright because I like the way it hurts""
- ""It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great... But when it's bad, it's awful. I feel so ashamed""
- ""You're the same as me. When it comes to love you're just as blinded. Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems, maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano. All I know is I love you too much to walk away though""

those are the verses that really hit home when I hear this song. 
I have to say the hardest thing about being in that relationship was realizing that even though we wanted to to be together we needed to be apart. He showed me how much he loved me by leaving me. I knew it was killing him just as much as it was killing me.. Maybe years from now we can try again or maybe not but, one thing is for certain I dont ever doubt the depth of his love for me.

			Good for you and for him that he had the strength to leave before he hurt you more! I liked your post! :)

			I share your pain.

I do not doubt the depth of his love for me neither, yet he will never understand the depth of my love for him. He is blinded by anger, frustruction and hurt cos I left him twice. Out of love, out of anger, out of fatigue, out of love and freedom for both of our souls..

I think this song works on two different levels and perspectives.

One one hand, the song reads like a realtime story. It is unfolding with every verse Eminem sings. His lines are describing what's happening right now, and Rihanna recaps the theme of the song with her chorus. It's an abusive relationship that she is unable/unwilling to get out of. Their relationship is spiralling downwards, and at the end he makes a threat of what will happen if she leaves again.
And we're left to wonder what DOES happen.

But if you look at it another way, we find out what happens. All of Eminem's verses are a flashback of the events leading up to that threat, which is the last thing that happens before the song starts. This is what's happening right now:

""Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie""

He is literally standing there, watching her burn and hearing her cry, and thinking about everything that happened leading up to this. Rihanna's lines become the present. 

Listen to the song back to back. The first time picture Eminem's verses as the present. The second time, picture his verses as the past. And in between imagine that she tried to leave again and he acted out his threat. This perspective certainly makes the song a lot darker.

Not sure if that makes sense to anyone, it looks a little confusing when I put it in writing...

Not Eminems' best song, but it's okay.

I think it's basically about a troubled relationship. Saying things you don't mean when you're mad, doing things you don't mean to because you're mad beacause it's in the heat of the moment. You love the person so much so you say whatever you can to make them come back, to make them stay. You say that it'll never happen again, but deep down you know it will but you just want to say whatever you can to prevent them from leaving. Then the cycle continues...

this song is one of my favorite from lady antebellum. i believe it's about a man who is so in love with a woman who is no good for him. they've tried to make the relationship work over and over again because neither wants to say that it's just not going to work. they would rather keep hurting each other than say goodbye. i've been in the situation and this song brings me back to it every time, which is the beauty of this song.

Love hate relationship. You love to hate them and hate to love them. This is how I see this song. He loves her but also hates her and all the fights that happen. I have been in a love hate relationship, we balanced each other perfectly and we loved to hate each other and hated to love each other. Some people don't like relationships like that but I love them. Keeps everything interesting and fun. All the ups and downs kept us going. That's what the song is saying

This actually makes me think of my own boyfriend. I adore music, more than anything on this earth, because it makes me feel good inside. No matter the tune, the melody, the mood, a song can put me in a good mood and mindset. Music's helped me through thick and thin, pulled me out of writer's block, and urged me when I was stuck deep in my writing ruts. It reminds me of good times and old song bring up memories from when I was a kid. Music's just always been there for me.

So far, nothing else has ever made me feel this way. Besides him. Yeah, this sounds REALLY sappy, but it's true. He's my music, my love song. <3 He's the first guy to actually get to me like this. I wouldn't call it love, not yet, but it's definitely getting there. :)

I love this song more than ever.

It sounds to me like whoever wrote it just slapped a bunch of words generally related to love together into a rhyming mess, without real attention or focus.
""I am hypnotized by your destiny"" doesn't make sense. Really? She's hypnotized by his *destiny*? Sure, it sounds nice at first. But really. REALLY.

""And I guess right now here's another one
So your melody will play on and on
With the best of them""
So *your melody* will play on and on *with the best of them*.
Selena (or whoever the writer is) seems to be struggling to come up with lyrics that have any coherence to them at all. Yeah, they sound pleasant and yeah, it's a catchy song (although the music accompaniment sounds awful). But the lyrics don't have ""meaning"" other than superficial words imposed on a superficial song to try and portray Selena Gomez as deeper than she really is.

@angel10101 















This song is about commitment issues. The chorus says says that they ""love you like a love song"". Selena Gomez or (the narrator of the song) fails to attach a specific meaning to the love that they have to the individual. Compared to another song such as ""Sweet Caroline"" or another song where the person who is loved's name is sung in the song, showing their complete love and devotion to the individual. Yet, Gomez can't attach this significance and rather simply says ""they love them like a love song"". This is also suggested in the first lines of the song ""It's been said and done Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now here's another one"". Gomez seems to be bored with the thought of loving someone, and can not find any uniqueness in the love that she feels for the person she loves.

The song suggests commitment issues by the fact that she keeps hitting ""repeat"". This means that she has been in several relationships before, playing the same love song only to fall in love with another person, repeating the process. If she truly loved only one person, then she would of chosen the words ""and I don't want this song to end"" or something to that effect. 

The song does have evidence showing she is in love with the unknown person. However, one of the final lines, ""You stand alone, to every record I own"" suggests that although she loves the person as an individual, she still has other records that she loves or has loved. Reinforcing the repeating nature of the love, and the fact that she probably will add new records to her collection. Overall, showing that she does not have the ability to truly connect to only one love and keeps repeating because of her boredom or the fact that she truly hasn't found the right one to write a real love song about.

Honestly, this is dumbest simile ever: ""love you like a love song.""  How can you have a comparison between two subjects when both subjects contain the same word in them?  In other words, you can't understand the word ""love"" better through the phrase ""love song."" 

This is just another example of the music industry making a catchy song with horrible lyrics in order to attract its listeners (which it does pretty well because of its beat).

Whatever meaning this song has, it is clouded by the horrible repetitive simile that makes absolutely no coherent sense.

This song really is amazing, and fits me perfectly. The way I see it is she is saying she knows the relationship could never work, and she really doesn't want to be together anymore, though she is still in love with him. All she wants is to remember the good times and all the good memories they have made, but she doesn't want to get back together because she realized they just won't work. Therefore, she doesn't want to feel him, see him, look into his eyes, or anything else physically speaking. She simply just wants to reflect on the good aspects of the relationship. That's just my interpretation and how I like to think of it.

Nothing is more damaging to your confidence and self-esteem than being in an emotionally abusive relationship.
Unlike physical abuse which rears its ugly head in dramatic outbursts, emotional abuse can be more insidious and elusive. In some cases, neither the abuser nor the victim are fully aware it’s happening.

I really think that this song is about a failed relationship with a modern American girl.

Social media has conditioned some women to believe that they can do no wrong and that the the world revolves their existence. This has led to a lot of women taking up a narcissistic, materialistic view on life. The Bieb basically is dating a girl that is caught up in all that trash and simply calls her out on it. If she's obsessed with herself THAT much that she refuses give an inch in a her relationship, then she should just go date, or, love herself. 

A snobby, self-centered, stuck-up product of our quixotic society.

I don't think this song is based on a relationship with a girl, but with a relationship with oneself. Early in his Career Justin Bieber made bad decisions and wants to move on but can't because the past keeps on haunting him. He's just telling his former self to leave and go away. Either Bieber is a very thoughtful person or he is a great songwriter and doesn't know it.

Nick Cave has specifically stated that he didn't use characters when writing the songs on this album (with the exception of Jangling Jack) and that all of them are written from his personal perspective. That having been said, unless Mr. Cave has been able to lead a secret life of pedophilia, I find it highly improbable that this song is about a child molester.

Oh come on. Paedophilia and child molestation - I think not. Demonic love, demonic hate and lust, far better fill the words and the performance of the song. Listen to the song and not just the lyrics, it is about rage and a man (or demon) who feels he has been stripped of what is rightfully is (R is for render unto me baby, M is for that which is MINE) The whole thing just creeps with an ancient malevolence including whispered echoes of the main lyrics (demon talking in many voices). The scope of the narrative (seeing empires fall etc.) is far beyond the imagination and deviations of the human kind.

			I agree with partenopei, this song is about how men lust after women. It's an insight into how a man's mind works. When Cave sings about the devil laying beside you, I take it to mean that all men have this devil-like nature when it to comes to sex and that the man laying beside you is no different (despite what you may think). I read an interview with Cave once and he said that he thinks women like his songs because the songs give them an insight into men's minds and confirm what they probably have always known about men...that is what this song is doing.

In general I think this song is basically saying a man will do anything and say anything to get a woman to have sex with him when he wants it...which is pretty much all the time, 'I will be your lover man, whatever you want me to be, but please have sex with me!'.

I agree with the last poster (partenopei)  This song is about lust, plain and simple.  There is nothing creepy about it, unless you consider all men creepy.  By this I mean that I see the lyrics as describing the darkside of all men when they hunger for sex.  It's exaggerated and it is not meant to be taken literally that he's a devil or that he is possessive of her.  It's about a simple guy whose brilliant master plan is to get his girl's dress off.  He can't help himself, he wants sex, and he will say or do whatever he needs to in order to get it.  And in his lust induced haze, he gets all territorial (even some mild mannered men get like in the bedroom) but there is no violence in the song.  

The song is basically about the male need for sex. He is a typical pig of a man but one whom I find sort of endearing because he makes at least the effort to profess undying love.

Alright, take a load of this: what if this is an answer to Billie Holiday's Lover Man?
songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107858529289/

Links:
-She's asking where her lover man might be, he starts every verse with his location(outside, on the floor, by her side(which she asks for as well).
-She's praying for a lover, he's coming down, saying Amen.
""A is for ANSWERING all of my prayers 
N is for KNOWING your loverman's going to 
be the answer to all of yours ""
-She asks to be whispered in her ear, while throughout the song whispers can be heard on the back.
-And of course, the fact he's a Devil and she says to give her soul for a loverman.

This might be odd, but Cave is know to make adaption on older Blues/Jazz tunes and refer to them.

Now, of course, this would add a curtain ""Be careful what for you wish, you just might get it"" feel to it.
That combined with the obvious masculine, low, urging need of sex theme this might be a message of precaution.

It's about mans intense lust and love for a woman who sees his desire and uses it to have power over him. She makes him wait outside her door and then crawl over the floor before she will let him have her. He is willing to do anything or say anything to have her. She makes him feel unworthy, weak, evil, stupid and old but she finally gives him what he wants and it makes him want her more. His lust is temporarily satisfied but he is infatuated and wants her to be his bride.

This song is about accepting one's true nature. It combats the popular religious belief that you can be forgiven by confessing your sins. You can apologize to others for who you are, but that's not the same as forgiving yourself. You'll always be tied to what you've done and at the end of the day if you feel like you're not a good person, then the only resolution is to attempt to change your nature. Yet, you're trapped forever in your own mind with the memories of what you've done in your life. If you have corrupted and harmed other human beings, then it's difficult to feel like you really deserve forgiveness. If you can't look at yourself and say that you've lived your life the right way or treated people well, then how will you ever feel like you're deserving of the good that life has to offer?

			very interesting post, did not even think that the song had any reference to a religious stance			

There is definately alot of feeling in this song. This song (to me) is about death, suicide as a matter of fact. 

This guy who's about to kill himself is writing to a loved one asking for forgiveness (""Please Forgive Me...Maybe you'll understand And won't cry for this man"")  for the fact that he can't change whatever is wrong with him, possibly a drug addiction(""So, you bring this poor dog in from the rain Though he just wants right back out again"") It's about sorrow, the guy is torn and depressed. He cries in the alleyway and confesses all to the rain, but then he lies to the mirror. He's Definately Got Issues.

@ChaseKenderes 

This song is about a man who is writing a suicide note. The trash fire is the little bit of hope that this person offered him, but the storm is the inevitability that he will kill himself, as he knows that the net has rotted away, but still chooses to give up and let go of his life. It’s a suicide note because it says, “What’s done and to do”, which means by the time he/she reads the note, he will be dead, but it hasn’t yet happened. And as he’s writing, he is feeling like he’s already dead (being so low the sky is all he can see, like in a grave), which is why he’s figuratively feeling for a pulse and is so far gone in his depression, that he sees nothing but that looming cloud of death in the distance. He also sees himself as this worthless person who doesn’t deserve to live. He tried to feel better about himself, but it was only on an outward notion, as it says that he’s lying to himself. He’s asking forgiveness because even though he may not feel like he deserves it, the person will be hurt that he killed himself. The note he is writing is to give some kind of clarity as to why he is killing himself, so the person he is writing it to will understand. He’s sorry because this person has already saved him from committing suicide before, but he just wants to put himself out of his misery and save the world from himself. When he says that he’s touching the clean to the waste, it’s actually him who is the waste and is comparing the person who saved him as clean and he’s tainted the person with the burden of trying to save this man.

One of the deepest songs Het has ever written. It's a bit long of a description but please give me a chance to explain and I promise, if you love this song as well, you will feel very inspired. 

This song is about addiction. Plain and simple. It's a letter being written to a loved one from a moment of clarity or a time when sober, such as being in rehab. If you read EVERYTHING together, not just ""my fingers seek my veins"", you'll see it. I'll just use ""her"" for simplicity's sake to refer to the person he cares for since it's Hetfield speaking to this person... 

The first verse is stating his intentions. His heart wants sobriety/reality, but his body keeps going back to the drug. He wants another chance with her, wanting to come back to his life/out of the ""rain"". 

Second verse, he ""fell""/relapsed because he ""gave up"" and his chances had been used up/net below has rot away. 

Chorus.. He's lost everything so he's ""keeping warm with the trash fire"" but he still craves/nowhere safe from the ""storm"" of addiction in his mind. And he can't bear to acknowledge/look at what he's become. 

He's literally writing to her (again, most likely from rehab or place of sobriety), coming to terms with what he's done and the path he must take to sobriety, and asking her not to feel pity since he accepts he's made these decisions, but instead asking for forgiveness.

Third... with sobriety, comes a feeling of being extremely ""low"" and depressed with what you've done, and craving forgiveness from those you've hurt. (And possibly the most important line of the song) ""you bring this poor dog in from the rain/and he just wants right back out again""... the endless cycle of addiction, you beg for help, receive it, but just end up relapsing/into addiction, wanting to or involuntarily.

At a time when he lost everything, he would ""cry to the alleyway/confess all to the rain"" because addiction stripped him of a home and everyone he cared about... no one left to listen, nowhere left to live. And as every addict does, he ""lies straight to the mirror"" (we lie to ourselves about everything... being in control, still having a life, ""going to quit tomorrow""); the one he's ""broken to match his face"" (hating what he sees when he looks at himself because deep down he knows the truth).
**********
I see many differing opinions of this brilliant song and Metallica songs have always been open to the listener's interpretation. But one thing I've noticed about Hetfield's songs about addiction, many of them are very difficult to pinpoint as being ABOUT addiction until you yourself have fallen into the abyss of addiction. There were a good 5 or 6 songs (Sad But True, House Jack Built, Bleeding Me, Trapped Under Ice, etc) I never had any idea dealt with this until you start coming face to face with everything he's saying. That's the sign of a true artist.. once you live thru it, you feel what he's saying.

Thank you if you've stuck with me to the end here, and I hope this helped bring the feeling and depth of this work of art into your heart and soul. And for those of you that suffer addiction like me, I hope this song brings solace and a tiny bit of serenity into your life as so many of James Hetfield's songs have done for me.

I interpret this song to be about a homeless man who once had a family, but drugs messed up his life and now he's out on the streets. 

He just wants his family to forgive him and no matter how they try to help him, he keeps ending up back ""out in the rain"", and on the street.

The trash fire symbolizes the place where he feels safest. It's warm and comforting, but not safe from the storm that is his drug use.

He's writing this letter to his family to tell them to forgive him and and not to worry about him because he did it to himself.

			I agree. He's messed himself up with drugs, with ""fingers seek my veins"" possibly referring to both where he will cut himself and drug abuse. The ""net below"" that ""rot away"" refers to the amount of chances he's had to redeem himself, but now he's reached the final straw. The ""storm"" is literally a storm and drug abuse. He plans to commit suicide (""to do""), and wants his loved one to forgive him, but not mourn him. My favourite part of the song is ""I cry to the alleyway /Confess all to the rain"" because it sounds cool and is the realisation point; he is beyond helping. I could go on for ages about this song...

Such an underrated track. The acoustic version is class as well.

You guys are all being way too specific. The purpose of these lyrics are so that everybody can relate. It doesn't necessarilly have anything to do with an addiction, or a homeless person. The song is about coming to terms with your mistakes. He or she has made a major mistake somewhere along the line and a friend has tried to help them out but were pushed away (So you bring this poor dog in from the rain Though he just wants right back out again).
Now he or she wishes that they had taken the help and are ashamed of what they have become (and i can't bare to see, what i've let me be). And now is asking to be forgiven for the stubborness.
The effect that i think is supposed to be felt by us (the fans) is this, If you are in any trouble, don't deny help because it will only get worse and life isn't meant to be lived alone.
I can see how drugs would be brought into this (my fingers seek my veins) but consider this:
It says My eyes seek reality - He or she is coming to terms that this is reality, this is the persons life. Maybe they're seeking veins to check that he/she is alive. Whether or not they are really living their life.
This song is full of metaphors and a million meanings could be thought up about it. It means whatever it means to you.

			My English teacher is a HUGE fan of the Beatles. As she informed the class- we had a mini lesson about the Beatles- John's son, when he was about 5 or 6, showed him a picture of a drawing he made of his friend, Lucy, in the sky with diamonds, and that's what the kid told his Dad. In fact, John's son got in contact with her when they were adults, it's also how he learned she developed Lupus. 

There's probably a chance that John WAS doing some sort of drug when he wrote the song, but his son's drawing was what inspired the song, not drugs. Go look it up man.

"
713,Mama Said.json,"
It sounds like a son who after loses his mother acts like its no big deal, and then later in life he realizes just how important she was to him. He tells the story out of order for dramatic effect so timeline-wise the story really starts with these lines:

‘Rebel, my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains’

 ‘Cutting the apron strings’ is a saying which means going off and being physically and emotionally independent from your mum, so he may have initially perceived her as a limiting force when he says things like ‘apron strings around my neck’. With this verse he communicates his need to rebel at that point in life and to reject domestic life which was the domain of his mother. He has ‘wild blood’ in his veins and he wanted to get out and be independent. When he says ‘the mark that still remains’ it could mean a few things, either that up until this point he always remembered his mother in the negative light of someone he wanted to escape or alternatively it could mean that this negative relationship that he had with mother when she was dying has scarred him for life. 

He then goes on to say that he left home young and that might be wrong but he knows that leaving home after she died isn’t the problem here, it was his relationship with her. I think he puts this line in there about leaving home to say that he was always going to leave and go do big things anyway, he’s not just leaving her specifically.

I’ll come to the chorus later, now we go back to the first verse where he is an adult looking back and he viewing his mother more fondly:

‘Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
""Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done""

""The brightest flame burns quickest""
That's what I heard her say
A son's heart sowed to mother
But I must find my way’

Here it looks like he’s realized that she was wise in her own way and it’s only as an adult can he understand that wisdom. The ‘brightest flame’ line is interesting because it shows that he sees that she really did understand him and his extreme creation/destruction tendencies. For those who were wondering there is a line in Blade Runner where they say that ‘a star that burns twice as bright burns twice as fast’ so the ‘brightest flame burns quickest’ is a similar concept, ie being spent up by your lifestyle. I’m not surprised to hear James use fire metaphors after his pyrotechnics accident!

Now the next verse:

‘Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be

Yeah, I took your love for granted
Not a thing you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see’

So now he’s ready to come back to that relationship with his mum after all the growing that he has done away from her. He’s a successful musician and he wants her to be proud but it sounds like he might not think that he was the best person. He wants her to help him and comfort him, he’s ready for that guidance and love again. However, the sorrow at the heart of the song is that she died. He wants her to hold him in her arms but all he has got to embrace is her tombstone.

Personally I see the verses as being there to tell the story and I see the chorus and bridge as direct expressions of this sorrow:

‘Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Oh, let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So, let this heart be still’

These chorus lines are far more ambiguous than the verses, so they could mean a lot of things. The pain he feels is pretty clear, in light of the story in the verses I think he’s never been able to escape the pain of losing her, he’s never been able to move on from that pain or be free of that pain. His mother’s got his heart, ie he still feels extraordinary love for her and it pains him. So he seems to be asking to be free of that pain or at least to ‘let this heart be still’, which might mean he wants peace from this emotional turmoil.  You could interpret it literally that he wanted her to let him go when he was a teenager but it doesn’t really fit in with the rest of the emotion. And the bridge part:

‘Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave’

‘Emptiness’ is another ambiguous word, he could be saying a lot of things here. I think not having her has left an emptiness in his life, and that can’t be filled. 

It’s a pretty revealing song, we never really saw this side of James before Nothing Else Matters so its great that he started to become comfortable in expressing his deeper emotional stuff! Anyway this was my interpretation, it’s alarmingly long but it think the song has got a lot in it!

i just lost my mother and so this song has a lot of meaning for me.basically it expresses how we all try to get distance from our mothers but its only when they die when we realise how much we they meant to us and how we took their love for granted.its one of those songs that you can only truly understand if you have been through the same experience.its hard for our hearts to let go of the memory and love for our mothers and it will only truly happen when our hearts are still, that is, when we are dead ,but if we dont try and let go of the pain and move on we may as well just die right now(closing an open book before its done)its easy for the pain of losing her to keep us in one place(let your son go/grow).in the end we all wish to do our mothers proud(i'm not all you wished of me)and we wish we could just see her one more time but know we cant(need your arms...cold stone is all i see).no matter what we will always remember what she gave us(apron strings...the mark still remains)and we will forever miss her(gave me your emptiness and i take to my grave)

I think it talks about how his mother tried to bring him up as best she could with what she had, she tried to teach him wrong from right but he needs to find his own way and live life his own way, he makes mistakes but doesn't ask for forgivness and when he realises that he took her love for granted thinking it would always be there it was too late because she had passed away. The chorus is about asking his mother to let go and let him live.

Hence the lines, ""Left home at an early age"" (he ran away from home) and ""but a cold stone's all I see"" (he finally returned home to learn his mother died. The ""cold stone"" is his mother's grave site).

To me, personally, this song respresents a meaningful interpretation of a son who is trying to leave home because his mother is just not giving him the kind of love and understanding he needs and he is torn, because he loves his mother even though he never showed it to her but neither did she to him. She is trying to cause him guilt for leaving and is trying to use her so-called love (apron strings around his neck), which she was empty of in the first place, to keep him home. And now that he has finally decided to leave, he is heartbroken because, even though he knows its for his own good, his mother wouldnt let him go for her own selfish need of trying to fulfill her emotional emptyness through him, which she was never satisfied with in the first place even when he showed his love to her.

This song sounds incredibly good like other classics, fade to black, nothing else matters. Deep down these Metal gods are softies/human, very in touch with their emotions, nothing wrong with that. This song is so country though...
could have done without the slide guitar, country signature sound.

719,March to the Sea.json,"
All of humanity is blindly following, heading straight towards death. People have even gotten tired of trying to find anything better (""No one looks up anymore"") for fear that it will make them see the truth, despair, and be vulnerable. God comes in the form of a spaceship, offering salvation. However, his own doubt fights back, saying that the hopeless march is the only way. 

He is sick of the march and decides to follow God's way instead. Still, he must continue on earth with the rest of the marchers.

@dmmcd I had a different twist to it actually, while thinking about your comment I see where you're coming from, but the more I listen to it the more I think that he's being cynical about God, saying that everyone ""walks right off into the sea"" when they follow God. But  then they see ""a spaceship in the sky"" a new way of life, one that doesn't necessarily include religion and he follows that instead but it still isn't good enough in the end

Then my dad told me his meaning, that it doesn't even have to deal with religion, in fact, it can be anything you want it to be. That the song is about following something that doesn't make you happy and ""kills you"" until you think you've found your salvation just to find out that even your salvation isn't good enough (""and once again I will be, in a march to the sea"").

@dmmcd @Altnation7 just because you are marching swords your death doesn't mean it's bad. the difference in the line he chose was that it was his choice. The first line he didn't know what it was or why they were walking. That's why I agree that it's a reference swords God and becoming a believer. Even tho he is walking to his death, he finally found something worth following there. Also Tyler is a Christian so I find it hard to believe he would be cynical twords it although I do see and appreciate to the vagueness of the song.

When I listen to this song, I hear that he's on the path to suicide and that he's mindlessly ""marching to the sea"" when he hears a voice telling him to follow them instead, to live, and that he's fighting his ""counterparts"", like later to be introduced Blurryface. I think the meaning that most people have submitted is very interesting.

@quietmonster81 that is what I thought too. 			

I could be a little bit biased, as I naturally would find a meaning in the lyrics I can connect with. Everyone finds their own meaning in art, or in this case music, so I may be interpreting the song wrong. I think this song is a very, very dark song. I think that it is about suicide, and I find it to have a pretty accurate description of what struggling with suicide is like. ""The march to the sea"" I think refers to everything that happens once someone's made up their mind leading up to their death. ""We're dying with every step we take"" ""we're dying with every breath we make"" shows how painful it is to keep going through the motions of life while struggling with suicide. And I think that the line he talks about shows how common it is for someone to be struggling with depression and having thoughts of ending their life, ""heaven forbid they see you cry"" people in this place tend to bottle up their feelings which almost always makes the problem worse and this silent suffering is often what causes people to get to the point where they feel they have no other option. ""And as we near the end of land, and our ocean graves are just beyond the sand, I ask myself the question, why, I fall in line"" is that moment just before acting on your thoughts where you stop for a second and reflect and ask yourself if this is really what you want. The spaceship that says ""follow me instead"" isn't necessarily any one specific thing, it is, rather, anything that might temporarily save us from ending our own lives. The most powerful lyrics, in my opinion, ""then the wages of war will start inside my head with my counterpart and the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase 'this lines the only way'"" I think the marchers in this case aren't actual people, they're the voices in your head that tell you that you're worthless or that you're better off dead or that you don't deserve life or that you can't handle it anymore, and the war in his head is because now there's another voice that might see one reason to stay alive among millions of reasons to give up. At this point you're fighting a battle in your head because part of you wants nothing more than to give up, but another part sees a reason to keep going. This war inside your head is one that will keep you up at night and distract you from everything going on around you and it's one that will have you laying on your bathroom floor with the door locked trying make a decision or even just somehow make the voices stop. It's a war that you can never win, no matter which side you pick. ""Take me up, seal the door, I don't want to march here anymore, I realize that this line is dead, so I'll follow you instead"" is when you've decided that maybe today won't be your last day, but then the song takes what may be an unexpected turn; ""so then you put me back in my place, so I might start another day, and once again I will be in a March to the sea"" means that just because you chose not to end your life today doesn't mean the battle is over, because every single day for what may even be the rest of your life you will find yourself again fighting the urge and thoughts of ending your life. Like I said I may be wrong, but that is what I felt. Like I said this song is very dark, and I found a connection with everything he says.

Along with what everyone else has said, I believe this is an amazing allusion referring to ""Sherman's March to the Sea"". This is the name most commonly used for the Savannah Campaign during the American Civil War. I won't bore you with details, but they basically tore through the southern enemy terretory, like badasses, without supply lines. It was considered one of the most revolutional acts in American history. 

Very strong lyrics, but what's new?... These guys are genius.

@socoandrew1990  In Sherman's March to the Sea  it wasn't badass, he allowed his soldiers to burn everything in sight, kill people, and rape women. Sherman also had the first ""scorched Earth"" policy which basically is above.  So I believe that the lyrics could be a reference to not wanting to follow these cruel policies and not get out of line. No offense, but badass is the opposite of the March to the Sea of the Civil War.

I am positive song is based off Matthew 4:18 As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. 19 “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”
I know people interpret it different but it is sad that such a beautiful song is interpreted to mean suicide when it actually has a hopeful undertone.
It is not just ""religious"" - it is about the calling, the push, any person who knows Jesus has - life gets you down, you go other ways, but in the end, God tells you He has a bigger purpose for your life, and that is to ""fish for men"" - tell people they are loved by God, and the good news of Jesus.

Tyler is on the ""wide path"" which leads to death and destruction instead of the ""narrow path"" of salvation.

The UFO is God.

I was just logging in to write the same thing. Thank you for actually understanding the profoundness of one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Most people forget that Tyler Joseph is devoutly Christian, and his songs (especially the earlier ones), which people confuse as him struggling with his identity, are actually manifestations of his struggles with society, and what people expect of him, and his religion, what his Father expects of him. Almost all the earlier songs revolve around this very same idea, glowing eyes, ode to sleep, oh miss believer, a car a torch a death (Jesus's death), etc. are meant to show how or why Tyler has overcome what society expects and what God expects, and not to represent the twisted view so many people identify as a struggle with suicide. 
If you want to discuss any songs, I would be glad to, just email me.
And thanks for actually understanding this song.

This song really helped me see that it was okay to follow a different path than everyone else. I was stuck in this cult religion, and sure some people might see the space ship as God, but for me I don't believe in a god. The spaceship was just someone who had helped me see the truth and told me that it's okay. Marching in a line is not going to do you any good in the end. You're going to die like everyone else, but you don't have to live like everyone else. ""Death does not distinguish between the sinners and the saints. It takes and it takes and it takes, and we keep on living."" So the message I go was really to not follow the flow of society. Or that religion isn't the only way. Of course that is just my opinion and what I thought of when I listened to this. So thank you.

I think that the meaning to every song is different to a lot of people. Personally I don't believe in God. This song to me is about suicide. When it says heaven forbid they see you cry the person might be getting bullied and hides their sadness. Then the spaceship is someone appearing into their life and saving them. When people say this way is the only way they might be saying it's the only way that I might actually be happy. This is some of the meaning of this song to me.

@IsleofSkye 















the line of people marching- to me- is of all the people surrendering themselves to the mainstream music and fashion. Tyler, or whoever the character is in this song, wants to stop marching and go their/ his own way. but he/ they has a fear that he/they will get beaten up by the others or whoever is in charge. he / they hears' hear a voice- the unknown, emo (to outsiders), meaningful and underground music- and it's telling him to follow their unknown and amazing ways. the spaceship is the bands and people within it. but one day the character/ tyler will fall back into the ""normal"" music sound, or in this case march to the sea.

@peejthehuman 















This song I think has a much deeper meaning than what I used to think it was. At first, I thought it was where he was an ordinary guy who fell in love but got his heart broken cause of the lyrics, ""but then you put me back in my place, so I might just start another day"" for the part of where he got his heart broken but learned it has a much deeper meaning than that. What I think it means is how he is on the walk to suicide. And how there's so many other people who are trying to kill themselves as well. I say this because of the lyrics, ""And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand"" and ""A strangers back is all I see, and he's only a few feet in front of me."" Saying there's other people who are making the same decision as him. But I think he is still deciding if he really wants to commit suicide from the lyrics ""i ask myself the question why, I fall in line."" As if he is asking him the question if he really wants to kill himself. So the song talks about how he is trying to decide to kill himself. Cause of the lyrics ""I see a spaceship in the sky and hear a voice inside my head, follow me instead."" As if the spaceship is his other voice saying, don't do this, you have so much to do still in your life, follow me instead. And to prove this is inside his mind. ""Then the wages of war will start, inside my head with my counterpart."" The counterpart being the spaceship that's inside his mind. And wages war as in he is debating what will come out of this and what wont. But at the end ""Once again I will be in a march to the sea."" Is where they decide at the end, to really commit suicide.

			 yours makes the most sense.			






			 yours makes the most sense.			

First off, the one lyric on this page is wrong. When James shouts before the guitar solo, he says ""FACE ME,"" not ""fix me.""  Second, no offense to anyone, but why argue over whether or not it is specifically about a herione or a cocaine addiction? Really, people. For me, the song isn't even about drugs or a drug addict. Yes, that is what it is saying on the surface, but for me it is saying that we are all being pulled by the strings of fate (or being toyed around with by god), with absolutely no power over ourselves. As humans, we enjoy our destructive behavior, no matter how much it makes us suffer, and in a way our dark nature is like a drug that we simply cannot get enough of, or come to terms with and overcome. Anyone else with intelligent ideas to offer on this song, I'd love to chat.

			Chop your breakfast on a mirror is a clear metaphor about doing blow. Cocaine users prefer to chop their blow on a mirror. An addict as described in the song would probably do some at breakfast. But the song could also be about heroin, or possibly someone who does both, like Nikki Sixx used to do.

I, personally, think it could even be about a girl. Imagine if this song was sung by a woman to her significant other. Pretty dark shit, but I find some women really do get off from the thought of controlling their man.

Battery has ended.A slight whisper of the silent tape mars the perfect silence .A lethal guitar sound starts.I had resolved to resist it this time.It's no use.The right finger moves towards the volume wheel of the Walkman steadily, as if under the command of a spell.The sound output increases to a maximum.My headphones pump the music inches from my soft,pink brain.The eyes are wide,slightly tearful as the brain reels under  the assault of heavy metal music at its best and fiercest.I am carried through music sweet and bitter till a million heads laugh in my head.I manage to gather myself together, just sufficiently to push stop.
I am as if stoned.That'll keep me going for a few days,I guess

This song is about falling in love when you're young.  But young love normally doesn't last and ""Charlie"" moves away.  She waits for him to come back for her, but he has moved on in more than one sense and he doesn't come back for her.  And the chorus means when you find someone young you should try and hang on as long as possible, but soon you'll have to let go.  And it's ""when being lovers meant a stolen kiss""  and also, ""the promises we made when we'd go walkin'.""

I feel like he's looking at himself and all the things he's done, and he's so caught up in mental illness or addiction or whatever, he doesn't even feel it anymore. The drug addiction or the eating disorder or the alcoholism or intense depression, (Maybe all of the above) that he's stopping to ask himself ""don't you mind that you're hurting everyone you love."" 

""I gave you something you can never give back, don't you mind."" The first time he tried drugs, that was it. He was hooked. He can never take that back.

""You've seen your face like a heart attack, don't you mind."" He looked in the mirror and didn't even recognize himself anymore. 

""I'm sorry I'd rather be high than watching the family die."" To cope with what's going on his family, (Possibly because of his issues) he's doing drugs. 

He's so unhappy and lifeless, he wants to end his life. He's asking himself, ""don't you care that you're about to end your life forever?"" And at the same time asking the world if it would care.

@abravar2 Wow, I never thought of that interpretation, but it completely fits. Damn. 			

To me it's about a young male who is crying out for help. He has derailed, as often many people do, to both escape the pain of living and 'watching [his] family die', as well as to try and get attention. He is in a dark place and desperately wants someone to give him some love and attention, and thus sets about destroying himself as a call for people to care. Whilst it is said in a matter of fact way, you can hear the frustration in the 'don't you mind?'
He eventually begins to try and illicit any reaction from those whom he loves, for he is searching for any kind of attention, and thus starts to attack his girlfriend's family ('I put your mother through hell') and his girlfriend herself ('I think I did something terrible to your body). He even considers killing himself to try and provoke a response, for then those around would realise how troubled he is and how much help he needs. Finally, he breaks down and says that he loves her even through this, and that she doesn't realise this. He feels no-one truly understands him, nor seems to feel anything towards him, be it hate, fear or love.

@TomTimms I whole-heartedly agree with this interpretation. 			

My view of this song is that it's the speaker's internal dialect, the main voice being the ""bad"" side of himself or a side representing his actions or feelings that aren't great. It's the side of him that gets high (got a plane in the middle of the night), the side of him that is violent (i nearly killed somebody), the side of him that doesn't care for his health maybe through drinking or smoking (i gave you something [bad health] you can never give back), the side of him that doesn't want to see his family, the side of him that is depressed (i was thinking about killing myself) and etc you get the drift.

""Don't you mind, don't you mind"" is his bad side saying to his good side ""Don't worry, I got this. I'm gonna keep doing my shit"" even though he knows it's not good for him.

It's an incredibly powerful song when you look at it through this perspective. It's painfully truthful and jarring. One of my favourite lyrics.

			This interpretation also confirms the title ""Me"", it's a letter to himself from himself.			






			This interpretation also confirms the title ""Me"", it's a letter to himself from himself.			

I think it's about the speaker having got a young girl, too young to be a mum, pregnant, and can't deal with the consequences of her having to have an abortion.

'I gave you something you can never give back' - a child
'Seen your face like a heart attack' - her shock at realising she's pregnant
'I think I did something terrible to your body' - got her pregnant and she had to have an abortion
'I put your mother through hell, I hurt your brother as well' - her family hate him for it

'I got on a plane in the middle of the night' - he left her without really telling her 
'I'm sorry but I'd rather be getting high than watching my family die' - I think this is explaining why he left, he couldn't face seeing his child be killed

'I nearly killed somebody' - I think this line is referring to the girl, not that he literally nearly killed her but having to look after a small child would've meant the end of the life she knew

And the repeated 'don't you mind, don't you mind' - he's saying that you doesn't need to worry, you'll be okay, and don't worry about us because it's over now
Like the last line, 'I love you, don't you mind, don't you mind.' He loves her but it makes no odds now that their relationship is over.

That's just my interpretation.
But this whole song is incredibly beautiful and sad, whatever way you look at the lyrics. And the last line just about breaks my heart :'(

@musicismylife7 Wow, I really appreciate this interpretation. Interesting perspective.			

@musicismylife7 I could see it being possible.			

I read that his mother had an abortion and tried to kill herself after he was born which makes me think this song could be written partially to the child she didn't have. If it is, I'm not sure I appreciate the anti-abortion sentiment but I digress. 

Post-partum depression is very common after child birth and I think the first half of the song could be written to the writer's mother. The line about doing something terrible to her body could be physically true but also mentally. ""I'm sorry but I'd rather be getting high than watching the family die"" the writer hides in drugs instead of facing the divorce and separation of their family.

The second half could be written to the child she didn't have. ""I put your mother through hell"" he blames himself for what she is feeling ""I hate your brother as well"" could be a mutually shared brother or the writer himself. and then saying ""I was thinking about killing myself"" is sort of a weird twisted apology and ""I love you"" continuing that guilt.

@tobiin 















This is my favorite song by the 1975. I saw them live a few days ago and they played this and I nearly started crying because of the raw emotion in this song. When I heard it for the first time, I put in one repeat because I love it so much. 

Firstly, I don't think he's saying ""I hate your brother"" it sounds more like ""I hurt your brother"". 

Anyway, my interpretation is that this song is about his addiction and his family. I also think it's about relationships. Not about a relationship with a girl, but his relationship with his family. 

If you didn't know, Matty used to be addicted to cocaine. I believe this song could be a letter he wrote to himself or someone (or at least aspects of it) early on during drug treatment or just something he wrote while overcoming his addiction. I think he sees himself as a different person after overcoming his addiction, which is why it seems like he's writing it to someone else. He's telling his old self that he's hurt people, his family in particular. 

However, in relation to the previous, I believe it could also be a letter to his brother, Louis. Or perhaps a mix of both a letter to his brother and himself. 

But the title of the song (""Me"") supports the idea that this is a letter he wrote for himself, in my opinion. 

Recovering from drug addiction and going through the withdrawal brings out a lot of bad feelings, which is why so many people relapse despite wanting to quit. That is one reason/theory why this song has such a depressing tone to it (also that recalling why one became an addict in the first place is also very depressing). 

The line ""I'd rather be getting high than watching my family die"" is possibly about his addiction to cope with his parents and other family problems.

@egobrain 















I think it's about addiction. He touches on damaging his relationships with his family, putting his mom through hell, damaging his body, being suicidal etc. he straight up says that he'd rather get high than watching it kill his family. It's written as if he's speaking to someone else but I think the song title makes it fairly clear that he's speaking to himself.

I actually suspect this may be Matt commenting on his mothers history and a working through of his feelings towards her. She had an abortion, and also attempted to commit suicide following his birth. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…. If thats the case, this song is heartbreaking and poignant.

@Vespertine 















I've heard so many different interpretations and meanings of this song but every time I hear this song I can't help but cry. I feel like this is a song he wrote about an abortion of one of his past lovers he got pregnant and how she had an abortion and the whole song and the lyrics are kind of a relay between the pregnant girl and the unborn child.

I see it as how once he found out that he had impregnated this girl he frightened himself at the sheer thought and fled- ""I caught a plane in the middle of the night""

and the references after almost every single verse ""don't you mind?"", I took in a way where he was looking at himself and asking how could he be so stupid and selfish at this time when she was actually experiencing it first hand.

""I nearly killed somebody, don't you mind, don't you mind?"" Kind of registers with me as if after she had the abortion he tries to contact her and speak with her about it but she's kind too traumatised to even be near him and I saw it as a cry for help to her to speak to him but she's so hurt by him that she shuts him out completely.

""I gave you something you can never give back""- referring to the child

""You've seen your face like a heart attack""- meaning they've both looked in the mirror and not recognised themselves through what they've become and just had a full on breakdown from everything they're going through.

""I was late, but I arrived"" Now, I took this two ways.
- meaning that maybe she wanted him to be there when she got it done but he was too frightened to go near her for a fear that he might hurt her even more.
- coming back after fleeing out of fear ((first line))

""Sorry but I'd rather be getting high than watching my family die""- talking as an explanation for why he was late ^^

""Exaggerate, and you and I""- Meaning the child, being unborn but such a big deal and impact on their lives, her and him.

""I think I did something terrible to your body""- getting her pregnant

Now I think is where he turns in the song and is talking to the unborn child:::

""I put your mother through hell,"" from the pregnancy and stress and drugs and her getting caught up and having to deal with everything he put her through, hell.

""I hurt your brother as well"" OK THIS GOT ME, I started thinking maybe it wasn't the FIRST time he had got a girl pregnant or that exact same girl for example. Its like he's saying sorry for being such a fuckup and doing this again to yet another girl creating another baby.

""Oh I was thinking about killing myself""- I saw this in a few aspects also;;
- He's thinking future wise, about if he had the child, ""would it be just like me?"" and how he would see himself in them everyday- seeing himself as the child and considering the abortion.
- He's too overwhelmed and upset that above all of his mess ups in life he had done something so stupid as to get a girl pregnant yet AGAIN ((see reasons for above^^)) that he just wants to make sure he won't do it again and he wants to stop himself from messing things up even more in his life and he just wants to end it (his life).
- maybe he wants to just escape and be with the child in a happy place away from all of him problems in his life.

the next line ""I love you"" gets me every time as you can hear how sincere he is and almost full of apologies in those three words as if he's trying to say ""Im sorry for ending you before you even started but i love you and its not safe for you to be in my presence, you were a beautiful mistake and I love you beyond words"" its almost like  perhaps he wanted to keep the child but knew as a fact he wasn't fit to ever hold her like she deserved.

And then the last verse just pretty much punches you right in the guts again with the most powerful lines in the whole song.

That's my interpretation of 'Me' By The 1975 and I think I might go cry now.

At the concert in Offenbach, Nick told the audience, a bit joking, that this song is ""not about an old guy who watches young girls, but about the deception of ideas"". 
So I always had this thought that the songs is indeed more than what it reads on paper, especially since the lyrics on ""Push the sky away"" became more abstract. But I couldn't figure out what it was.
Now, it makes really sense when you look at it. Especially the lines:
""I believe in God
I believe in mermaids too
I believe in 72 virgins on a chain
Why not? Why not?""
...are an evidence for this, as it seems to me.

And I quote:
MESSAGE TO HARRY MANBACK
Hotsy Menshot from Green Jelly (a jokemetal
band in which Maynard debuted as
one of the Three Little Pigs explains:
“The voice on Message to Harry Manback
is my old friend Francesco, (from Rome,
Italy) who would come and live with me and
my old roommate Jerry, off and on. I kicked
him out after he stole some possessions
from Jerry, and he called that night on the
answering machine because he was afraid
of me, and couldn’t threaten me to my face.
He was 6’2” but only weighed 130 pounds
and looked like Ichabod Crane from Sleepy
Hollow. I could’ve broken him like a twig.
He called back again the next morning, and
that message was finally heard on Message
to Harry Manback II on Salival. Anyway,
everyone used to imitate it from my impression,
even though they have never heard it.
Years later, I found the tape and played it for
Figlio di puttana, sai che tu sei un pezzo di
merda?* Hm? You think you’re cool, right?
Hm? When you kicked out people [out

This song is in collaboration with the other song on the album Die Eier Von Satan. It is trying to tell you to read in between the lines. In Message to Harry Manbeck, the man is very angry and is saying bad things, but to a person who did not know Italian, it would sound very romantic, even though the lyrics are vicious. Now in Die Eier Von Satan, the lyrics are merely are cookie recipe. But since it is in German, a very dark sounding language, the message sounds very satanic. The song is showing the difference between the two, and telling you to look deeper into the song, instead of just reading the lyrics and saying, “ ohh, that is such a bad song!”

@berserker 















I agree with the person who wrote that the lyric is likely just about an English guy, perhaps Paul himself while touring France, who is infatuated with a lovely French girl. The lyric mostly states very primal emotions about desire because anything more complicated is not possible due to the language barrier. The honesty is in that, despite the language barrier, there is really nothing more that could be said anyway. The cleverness is in using the French language, which not only sounds romantic to the English-speakers, but also uses the language barrier as a metaphor for what cannot be expressed through words about feelings, in any language. Using minor chords where he does also emphasizes the angst about wanting to say more than words allow. It's an amazing song in that, though the lyric is not sad, it produces an ambivalence of emotion, combining joy and melancholy. A rich palette in such a deceptively simple song. Between '66 and '67 Paul was at his peak that few writers can match. In my opinion, Paul wrote the 2nd and 3rd best American songs ever in Yesterday and Eleanor Rigby (the best being Mancini's and Merecer's Moon River).

""Michelle, my beautiful, we go together very well."" == ""Michelle, ma belle, sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble""  thats the exact translation... I speak french since i'm able to talk. ;)  Very nice song. About a guy who prolly fall in love with a frenchie girl.

Well, no matter what he says I think what is important is that he can't say what he really wants to: ""I love you, I love you, I love you..."" And isn't that a feeling we can all relate to. I know there is more then one occation, when all the right words didn't come flowing out.

Well, I'm French, and I agree with what you said : the french part is the exact translation of the english part!!! No need to translate it in english, then, it is already done...
Well, this song is very appreciated by French people, of course, it is nice to hear the Beatles singing in our language!
In addition, his english accent is sooooo cute...
Actually, when hearing ""Michelle, ma belle, sont des mots qui vont très bien ensemble, très bien ensemble"", it is just what one says to seduce a woman : waw, your name is beautiful, and it goes well with ""ma belle""! One could think he just wants make her feel flattered, but he sounds so depressed when singing that, that it is obvious that he is just sad and wants to stay with her, that's all.

Well, none of you even got close.  I wonder how long they will allow my response to remain. We will see. 

Michelle Levallier was born April 5 1960 to Monique Levallier, a French make-up artist living in London, and J. Paul McCartney.  A young, broke and irresponsible Paul had several illegitimate children for which he did not acknowledge nor take responsibility .  When told of the pregnancy, Paul broke off the relationship. Devastated,  Monique moved back to Paris and had Michelle.  Upon Michele's 5th  birthday, Monique sent Paul an extremely  adorable photo of his daughter and told him that Michelle wanted to meet her father.  Paul was very moved by the image of his daughter. However, in 1965 he was in a serious relationship with Jane Asher and he was in the middle of BeatleMania.  Despite his best intentions, he never seemed to find time to go visit his daughter.  He must have felt shame for neglecting his responsibilities. At the same time based upon the song lyrics demonstrated his curiosity for the unconditional love that a father has for his daughter, even though they never met.  So, this song was written as a letter of introduction to his young, French speaking daughter  trying to assure her that although he never met her, that he loves her, that there are valid reasons why he is being a selfish prick and that he will find a way to make time to come see her.  I don't believe that ever happened.  Michelle eventually switched her surname to McCartney, became a bass musician and still lives in Los Angeles.

This song truly resonates with me personally. As someone who has suffered from major depression since I was 14 (28 now) It is so ironic... ""Am i the only one...?"" is quite literally a thought I would have years before this song came out and I instantly fell in love with the tune from the very first verse. It is so ironic because clearly others out there are having mental struggles, as well.

SO much of this song is a perfect reflection of what true depression is like... it is paired with its lover: anxiety. When he discusses how his mind is fighting this constant battle against the 'lion' and it won't let him sleep, so he has sought a permanent fix: permanent 'sleep' in the form of suicide: ""It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead."" 

With depression and the accompanying anxiety one finds him/herself trying to use the depression sleep for abnormally long periods of time, seeking reprieve from through the form of unconsciousness in between times when the anxiety causes abnormally grueling insomnia. One can easily have those thoughts of defeating the 'lion' aka depressed and violent thoughts through suicide. For the sufferer, it doesn't seem like a cowardly act and can, in fact, seem like a very logical solution: ""you- depression/anxiety- are killing me anyway, as I do not feel truly alive but rather like a walking zombie pretending to be normal:

 (""I am not as fine as I seem.
Pardon, me for yelling and telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees."")

So the suicidal thoughts are warped into a form of bravery: ""If you're taking me down, I'm taking you down with me.""

I've been there, and when I first came across this song it totally hit home. It seems several of their tunes deal with the issue of suicide/suicidal ideations. They seem to always end the songs with a hopeful stanza, so I'm curious as to whether they are speaking from personal experience in overcoming depression and transforming that negative energy into hope and optimism- anyone know?

			Also, I doubt this is what they actually meant with the line:
 ""'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind""

but since songs are meant to be interpreted in various ways, I'm going to go for it. A lot of people with depression use drugs and alcohol as a method of self-medicating. Whether it's shooting up a bag of heroin or downing an entire 1/5th of vodka, the purpose is to 'kill your mind' temporarily. You will, most likely, when the drugs/alcohol wear off, feel like complete shit and probably withdrawing to the point where you feel worse than you did before, but you are alive. By blacking out for the time being, you prevented yourself from actually committing suicide because your mind was 'killed' for the time being.

Again, unlikely what they meant, but hey, it sort of fits.

@julius1848 Oh my God, I'm not even kidding! Your description is so accurate and relatable and just SO RIGHT! I hope you've kicked depression's butt, because it's a jerk! I have had depression for as far as I can remember, literally I s2G. I tried telling my parents but they don't believe me and say that a ""child"" like me (do they have ANY idea how mentally matured I am? Like not in the bad way, but in the SAD way.) has no idea about depression, so I relate to this song a lot. On a spiritual level, man. 
TOP is life.

@julius1848 I think you're right on all counts. I'm quite certain Tyler doesn't advocate alcohol or drugs to kill your mind, but I'm equally certain the temptation is always there. I read somewhere that Tyler is a Christian, and I do believe he gives voice to his own struggles in his songs, which would explain why he sings about depression with such happy music. The music is the hope he has in God through Christ. I'm a 47-year-old Christian who thought Christians never got depressed... until I went through several cycles of depression myself. I learned that the Bible is FULL of people experiencing depression from Joseph to Moses to David to the Sons of Korah (who wrote, ""Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.” ‭‭Psalm‬ ‭42:5‬ ‭NIV‬‬ bible.com/111/…) to Elijah to Jesus himself to the Apostle Paul. It was mostly in my teens and 20s, but it surfaces in weird ways even still. Yet I also know the hope that Tyler points to. Unfortunately, too many people in church believe you have to have it all together to come to church or to God at all. Not true. Jesus said, ""Come to me all you who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest."" Tyler Joseph has found that rest, and he uses his songs to shine light in the darkness for those who are searching for a path out of the dark forest.

I thought the part where he goes ""waging my wars behind my face and above my throat"" that sounds like the feeling you get right before you cry. Where it hurts right above your theoat

@sbrichie14 















Well, in my opinion this song is about thoughts. We can take the lyrics to a song and apply them in any way to our own lives, and this one to me is a reminder that I am not the only one who has had to deal with an attack on the mind, or maybe it was just me all along. All I know is that the mind is a battlefield and we can choose to win or lose. I believe that the lion in the song is Satan, cause he loves to use our mind as a garbage dump. We can choose to listen and dwell on his roaring lies, or we can choose to reject it.

This song is great. Its about thinking too much and not being able to control it. Its about feeling alone even when there's people around who say they understand. But no one can really truly understand the fights we have with ourselves. ""behind my face and above my throat.""				
				







 
There was an error.





@FrTHMMRS21 















This song is about thinking too much and wanting to stop. When it says ""Am I the only one I know, waging my wars behind my face and above my throat"", I'm pretty sure it's referring to your brain. Because, if you think about it quite literally, your brain is behind your face and above your throat. And I think the lion in the song is your thoughts. So, you're fighting wars against your thoughts, and they're trying to kill you, and that's where ""Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions.They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win. I begin to assemble what weapons I can find Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind."" comes in because he calls the lions suicidal. So the lions are suicidal thoughts he's having and he has to kill his mind before those thoughts make him destroy himself. And ""And I will say that we should take a day to break away  From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone. And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone."" says that you need breaks from the self hating and suicidal thoughts in your head.

@MyUserIs2Long 















this song is definitely about depression, no doubt about it. the ""war"" is in his head. his brain is where the depression is. it attacks you constantly, hence all the pain references. the migraine represents thoughts because when you have depression your brain constantly produces sad thoughts and even if they don't make sense they make you feel like you're suffocating or drowning and you just want it to end.

""Am I the only one I know waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?""
my favorite part of this song. tyler is asking ""am i the only one i know..."" as referring to his depression and he feels that he is alone with this and that there is no one there to help him. and ""waging my wars behind my face and above my throat."" is keeping all his thoughts and wars (his problems from the past) in his mind and his 'throat' is getting the feeling thinking about all this is the feeling right before someone starts to cry

@devonbarks 















alrighty so this is my favorite song. top is not my favorite band, one of, but this song is something I understand on so many levels. so lemme explain.

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat.
Shadows will scream that I'm alone.

I-I-I I've got a migraine.
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways.
Thank God it's Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days.

this part is honestly easy. essentially tyler is admiting to extreme depressive feelings (Am I the only one i know, ...shadows will scream that im alone)  and is forced to deal with them on his own, and is not necessarily winning (Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat)
The depressive feelings essentially surround you, hence (my pain will come from up down and sideways) He has gotten to the point where he honestly debats suicide with (thank god its friday cause fridays will always be better than sundays cause sunday is my suicide day)
I don't know why they always seem so dismal.- doesnt know why he feels hopeless
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow and a slight drizzle.-trying to guess why
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed- suicide notes
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.-wants all the shit to stop
Let it be said what the headache represents - an attempt to explain the depressing thoughts
It's me defending in suspense - trying and failing to ignore the thoughts
It's me suspended in a defenseless test - acknowledges there is nothing he can do
Being tested by a ruthless examiner - the examiner is depressive thoughts
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts.
I do not have writer's block my writer just hates the clock. - one of the few parts I dont have a reason for 
It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.
Tyler is trying to remain hopeful with (but i know we've made it this far, kid.)


I am not as fine as I seem. - pretty straight forward
Pardon, me for yelling I'm telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me - admiting his thoughts are not happy or healthy
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees. - describing his thoughts as a barren wasteland
Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait. - still attempting to explain to the listener
Something you avoid yet it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that hold's back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent. - an attempt to convey how not okay he is (yes that was a mcr refrence)
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence - his mind is full of horrible thoughts
My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find - almost no wear in his head is safe from these thoughts
I did not know it was such a violent island - tyler didnt want these thoughts but he has no choice
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions. - extremly violent and unstable thoughts
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin - the thoughts want him to die
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win. - he can live or give in to the thoughts
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find - sturdying himself to stand against his thoughts
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind. - I want a tattoo of this line.  to stay alive, you have to fight and defeat the suicidal thoughts

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone. - the game (life) is something that you dont go through alone and people can help you
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone. - to quote zombieland, enjoy the little things.

@Gamerman - I really love your interpretation! I thought i'd add my own bit.
 >I do not have writer's block my writer just hates the clock. -<  He's an ambitious musician, dealing with depression isn't making it easy for him to write music. I think the clock adds a sense of anxiety.  ALSO having too much time to think can really weigh you down.

""Am I the only one I know""
They're questioning whether they're the only people to have ever thought these thoughts or felt these feelings.

""Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat""
Their mind is stuck in a continuous war against themselves, where they're constantly battling against depression and trying to function normally, but this war isn't ever a simple one. This war is all hidden away in their brain, whilst their face is smiling. 

""Shadows will scream that I'm alone""
They feel as if they're alone, and that nobody else feels like this. ""Shadows"" may be referencing to the depression itself, where it tells you that you're alone.


""I-I-I I've got a migraine""
The migraine is a reference to their depression. The fact it's described as a migraine suggests that they felt a need to describe the depression in a form of physical pain, because mental pain is seen as many people by something people can just ""get over it"", rather than a serious issue. It puts emphasis on how much pain this is causing for them, and how it's almost impossible to ignore. 
""And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways""
The pain isn't only mental, it causes pain in their body, and they feel as if they've been trapped by this pain, and can't escape. 

""Thank God it's Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays
'Cause Sundays are my suicide days""
This suggests that their life is a constant repeat of days, where they spend the weekdays at their worst, and then spend the weekend worrying about going back to the weekdays. 

""I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow and a slight drizzle""
Everything around them now feels depressing, they see sadness in everything around them. 

""Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed""
They don't even know what's making them sad anymore. ""letters by my bed"" may be suicide notes.

""Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head""
To them, death is a more inviting option than having to deal with all the pain. Death seems like the only way to get out of it, and it seems as if it'll get rid of all the pain. 

""Let it be said what the headache represents
It's me defending in suspense
It's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examiner
That's represented best by my depressing thoughts""
They feel as if this is a test, and it's ""ruthless"", whilst they're left there not knowing what to do, being ""defenseless"". They feel as if their thoughts will never leave them alone, and that they're incredibly harsh on them. 

""I do not have writer's block my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead""
They lose a lot of sleep because of the depression, and it means that they're constantly tired. There's another mention of death, which suggests it's on their mind a lot and that they see positives in death, that they'll finally be able to rest when dead.

""And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head""
The fact it's repeated shows that it's not a one off thought, that it's something that often goes through their mind. 


""But I know, we've made it this far, kid""
They've managed to live through life so far.


""I am not as fine as I seem""
They look as if they're fine, however a world of depression hides within them. 

""Pardon, me for yelling and telling you green gardens
Are not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees""
They feel as if they have to apologize for being depressed, and that it's their fault. They feel as if it makes them a burden to people and that they annoy people and disappoint people when they decide to talk about it. 

""Freeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that hold's back contents
That makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent""
They suggest that the things going on in their minds are unforgettable, and that it's an experience you never truly forget. They suggest that it's filled with terrible things, things that are worse than something that's said to contain all the evils in the world. This comparison emphasises how it feels like it's the end of the world to the person, and how much pain it causes. 

""Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind ship-wrecked this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind""
In this part, he creates a metaphor for how his depression feels. They say that their mind is ""ship-wrecked"", which conveys that they never meant to end up there, and that they can't escape now and they're lost. The fact it's the ""only land my mind could find"" suggests that they see no other way other than this land, and it's the only way they can currently be. ""Full of tidal waves"" suggests that it feels overwhelming, something that totally engulfs them. ""suicidal crazed lions"" is the thoughts that are telling them to kill themselves, and the fact they're lions suggests they're deadly, and that they're terrifying. ""I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win"" conveys that the battle against suicidal thoughts isn't an easy one, but it's one you have to do to survive. ""'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind"" suggests that the only away to get away from the island is to get away from all your thoughts and feelings, and that the only think you need to kill is your mind, not you. 

""And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone""
Here, they convey that everyone needs a break, and it's important to reach out to other people. It may suggest that we need to savor the good moments, and with the bad ones we just need to know that it will get better. 

""Made it this far
Made it this..f..""
The fact they don't quite finish the last ""far"" suggests that the fact they've made it doesn't mean they will always, and that it's an ongoing struggle to make it that far for them. 


Overall, the song describes a persons experience with depression. In my opinion, it's a very good picture of what the experience is like.

@seeing 















Agree with the interpretation by Seeing above.

Sam Smith's mournful tone speaks to a certain social commentary about the state of music production today, indeed any kind of creative production, the self-expression of a person's deepest joy and craft, which has become digitized and commoditized.

He says he ""I don't have money on my mind,"" but there are no negatives in the brain. If you tell a person, ""I'm not thinking of a pink elephant,"" you know they can't help but be thinking of a pink elephant, because they had to have it in their brain to even speak those words.

So, I think this song elegantly addresses the struggle artists face.. of course they need to think about money. Money is survival, is compensation for their time and hard work, and they need to think about it, but it is a struggle to keep their joy in the craft authentic when faced with survival concerns.

""Don't want to see the numbers
I want to see heaven""

Such a beautiful lyric. Sam Smith is a bird with a beautiful voice who recognizes he is in a gilded cage now, as so many of us human beings are, because of the commodification of human beings. But he still sings softly of heaven and brings heaven to me. Thank you for your love of your art.

This song is about someone (Dan Reynolds) who probably has a mental illness like depression or OCD.

@ScarScar99 ur opinion :)


I see this song as a person being abnormal and being so terrified to show it to society that it builds up inside and creates a hate-filled... well, monster. They become so isolated that it just keeps growing and they're too scared to tell anyone because they think they'd be labeled as a freak so they try to be normal and fake it  but they hated being 'a pretender' and having to act as someone so very different than what they truly are. They begin to think it's their fault. It seems like a horrible trait to them so they're afraid to show people the real, true, flawed but somehow perfect person they really are.

Well, here's my opinion:

Ever since I could remember,
Everything inside of me,
Just wanted to fit in (Oh oh oh oh)

It is about a guy, who since he was a kid just does not fit in his society. Example: all the people liked soccer, he liked basketball.

I was never one for pretenders,
Everything I tried to be,
Just wouldn't settle in (Oh oh oh oh)

He never had no one who really wanted him, and he tried to do different activities but they just didn't fit in him.

If I told you what I was,
Would you turn your back on me?

After all I said before, he was normal, but there was onte thing that changed him, I don't know, maybe a strange disease, etc.

And if I seem dangerous,
Would you be scared?

The thing that changed in him makes him seem different that how he really is.

I'm only a man with a chamber who's got me,
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
A monster, a monster,
I've turned into a monster,
A monster, a monster,
And it keeps getting stronger.

He just don't want to be criticized by people anymore, and he accepts his condition and leave ""the monster to escape"".

Can I clear my conscience,
If I'm different from the rest,
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh oh oh oh)

I think this part is self-explanatory.

I never said that I want this,
This burden came to me,
And it's made it's home inside (Oh oh oh oh)

He continues being criticized by people, and he wants they to understand that he didn't wanted what happened, it only happened. 

Well, that´s all my opinion, sorry if I have a mistake I'm not anglophone.
I came to these conclusions beacause I have acne, but not the normal acne, and all the people believe that I don't clean my face (Actually I clean my face third times a day), and I've been bullied in some occasions (I really don't care being bullied). Also, as the people doesn't like my acne I neither, and it's so much to you when not even you like your face as for all the people keep saying the same thing.

			This song is like, excellent for Middle-High Scholars, I praise Imagine Dragons and you for your excellent interpretation, I had about the same interpretation, also, another good example to match well with the ""If I told you what I was, would you turn your back on me, and if I seemed dangerous, would you be scared?"" part is lets say someone is an Atheist and a Christian meets him, the atheist would be basically the narrator saying that much people are Christian, and the Christian MIGHT not like him simply because he's an atheist, hence ""If I told you what I was, would you turn your back on me?"" part.

			I feel your pain about acne even though I may not have it as bad. I've also been bullied about my acne and I feel like i've tried practically everything to get rid of it but it just won't go away. I also feel like I am the only kid in school with acne and I feel so isolated. I love this song because it basically describes me.

Here is my look on this, but I think this song can be understood in a number of ways.

It tells about this guy who just wants to fit in. In some way, he's different and if he showed his true colors, people wouldn't accept him. He has taken on a role, being someone he isn't. Now, he don't like this role, not at all. He sees himself as a monster, this new him being forced onto him. He wants to escape this new role, as he sees that it isn't him.

			My interpretation was that the monster is like the disease or what you call his ""true colors.""			






			My interpretation was that the monster is like the disease or what you call his ""true colors.""			

This song expresses what it feels like to be  ""awake"" in this world.  It explains what a person goes through inside when you ""wake up"" to the harsh reality that everything we were taught about life and what we know about ourselves, is a lie.  The person in the song understands that he isn't who he thought he was in life anymore, and he knows deep down that he's been living a lie his entire life.  He wanted to learn the truth at the moment, but he never asked for the burden that it carry's by knowing it.  He's is trying to fight the awakening process that one goes through when you learn who we are on the deepest level. He's trying to forget the things that he understands the most about himself, because it makes him feel disconnected from the rest of society.  He used to naturally just ""want"" to fit in, but the truth that he learned has awoken a side of him that can't live in the reality of the old person he used to be.  That side of him is the monster that wants to be set free, but he is scared to leg go of the old him, because of the way people might judge him.  He's not ready for the world to see who he truly is just yet, and the more he trys to hide it the more the monster inside of him wants to come out.  

Its hard for people to learn about the truth and then just go about their lives like nothing ever happened.  Once you become spiritually awake, its hard to look at life from the same perspective that you used to.  Your soul wants to be set free at this point, and the more you keep it trapped inside, then the more it begs to come out.  Most people subconsciously keep that monster inside because they've never met that side of them yet.  But if when you are consciously aware of that monster inside of you, then its hard to fight it.  The key to letting that monster out is to let go of everything that limits you from expressing what your true beliefs are.  Accept losing everything you ever knew, and begin to grow into your true Divine self.

@psychoimp 















The thing about songs is that people can relate to them with their different experiences. Some other people who have commented have suggested this song being related to people with mental disorders, which I find understandable. But as someone who has never experienced this, I cannot personally relate to this. 

My interpretation is that this is about an internal conflict. I hope that you all feel that a need for belonging is inherent to all humans; humans are not solitary creatures. They build societies where they belong to, are conditioned to belong to that society, and if that fails, find a society in which they do belong. The conflict is between the need to belong and the need to be true to yourself. 

As a child who has been rejected by society, or on a lower scale, by his/her peers; a child who does not fit in this society, and cannot move away, you'd want to change yourself. This works if you're close to what is expected of you... but if you're very different, it feels unnatural. You try and try, but the habits, the values, just don't settle. 

I keep on lying to myself, and to the rest of society, who am I really? I know that this is not who I am, but you don't. If I told you that this is not who I really am, would you not like me anymore? If you think the real me is (a dangerous person?), would you be scared? I feel like everyone around me is being true to themselves, and I'm the only one with the problem, that perhaps something is wrong with me. 

I only have a candle to guide me; in this dark place, I don't know which way to go. Should I find myself? Should I find my way out? I'm losing myself, I don't know who I really am. This lie that I've been acting out all this time, is growing stronger, that it's becoming the real me. I've turned into this lie... and I don't want to. 

Can I ever find the right thing to do? If I show you all who I really am, will you all hate me? Do I have to run and hide? I never said that I wanted this, I just wanted to be myself and fit in at the same time. But now there's a problem, and it won't leave me. 

Will you leave me if I tell you who I really am? Would you be scared of me if I'm not who you think I am? I get the feeling that everything around me is normal, and I'm the only one with this problem.

@BetterThanYuu 















It's about a person who discovers that he's turned into someone or something he's not because of something he said or did or failed to say or do, and he wants to escape it. I know it because I feel like I am turning into a monster every time I start yelling at people.

@seeing 















This definitely has everything to do with mental illness.
Take it from someone whose taken so much verbal and emotional abuse as a kid and then years later, diagnosed with severe anxiety.

It almost to the point where I feel like im going crazy or in this instance, turning into a ""monster"" something other than myself.
Anxiety is no joke and people who take it lightly or as someone's is just paranoid or worried, that they need to calm down, no.. It goes deeper than that. 
Extremely deep.

I get so frustrated with my anxiety and I feel as if its taken over everything in my life. 
Makes me hesitant to do alot of things and tasks, that a ""normal"" person would see as ""not a big deal.""

Finding someone to accept you for a mental illness (anxiety) can be beyond challenging.

This song represents a very classic drama, that of people who leave home, which is typically a small place, to search for fame, fortune and happiness in bigger places, to never be able to return or ever feel at home anywhere. Holly herself is a tragic character, so beautiful and glamorous, surrounded by reach people and celebrities, drifting in and out of her life, always fascinated with her, never loving her. In the book she actually doesn't end up with the poor writer, they are just friends and she sends him a postcard from buenos aires one day, so basically she keeps drifting in these strange circles to never find home again.

Again - I'm surprised there are no comments on this one either...this is another awesome song. I love the way Bruno explores different chord combinations on this album and it differs so much from Doo Waps & Hooligans....much darker....much better in my opinion, not so melancholy, more aggressive...
This song is self explanatory too. It is that person that you are not dating, but you meet up with, a favorite one night stand maybe....where you have the electricity in the physical relationship...this person who is your personal drug. Its a good song - definitely another album favorite.

			Very well said, I agree completely			






			Very well said, I agree completely			

This song is simply AMAZING!!! Am I the only one who thinks this song is maybe about addiction? As Moonshine is a very powerful type of drink. Mars uses words like ""chemicals"" and ""fire"" which could be associated to alcohol. To me it's about finding something that will take you away from the world (""take us to the stars tonight""). And the singer can't stop (""I know I was with you last night but it seems like it's been so long""). And it also defines him (""Everybody knows I'm not myself when you're gone""). I get that vibe from the song because even though the lyrics seem joyful, it's sung with sorrow. Maybe I'm over-analyzing this song but that's how I interpret it.

			I actually just created an account to say this seems to be 100% accurate to me. As a person with bipolar in one vein and alcoholism in the other I agree that when ""the moment that you kiss my lips I start to feel wonderful...it's something incredible"". From my alcoholic perspective, the thrill of drinking is cracking a bottle or putting it to your lips, not actually drinking or getting drunk (""take me to the stars"") even though the escape from reality can be thrilling at times.

When you mention joyful and sorrow in the same sentence, it's exactly like the love and hate relationship of alcoholism. I love alcohol, but love to hate it, and hate to love it. It seems to me the song was written as a broken love story in that Bruno had to let go of that love/hate relationship to move on and give himself a better and healthier life, but he will always remember the good times. Just like any broken relationship, whether it's a girl/guy/bottle.

To me this song is about a girl who has gotten out of a tough relationship.

Then she met a guy, who was in the same position as her, but through meeting the girl, he ralized that what he had before was great.

And the guy leaves her to go back to the original girl and the girl who is singing the song basically is critizing both herself and the guy.

Or at least that's how I see it.

Its kind of like a song where you never feel good enough to have that something special.

The song is from the other woman's perspective the one who had the affair.  Believed him when he was saying what was wrong with the relationship.  She thought he would leave the wife for her, thought they were seperated or getting a divorce whatever he told her.   She is calling the wife simple that's what she sees because she believes he's leaving her. She thinks she's weak and never has much to say even when she's mad.  I see it as she has learned not to spout off even when she's mad as being stronger because the wife has learned you can't take words back.  She understands, she don't let go of anything even when the pain gets really bad. That was when the wife found out he had an affair or is having one, and she's still there

You had it all for a pretty little while
And somehow you made me smile when I was sad
You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart
That was him playing both sides of the fence
HE made her smile even when she was sad...

I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie

 that is the narrartor because she had come out of a bad relationship and thought they were going to have a future. She got what she deserved  a broken heart for believing his lies 

Forgiving you, well, she's stronger than I am
You don't look much like a man from where I'm at
  She the other woman, wouldnt've been able to forgive him, so there she is sayin the       wife is stronger than her, he doesn't look like a man to her because now she see's him as a liar and a cheat.

It's plain to see desperation showed it's truth
You love her, and she loves you with all she has
the desperation here is the man because he desperately doesnt want to lose his wife and all the have ...be it their love, the kids, the house, etc...
The wife has to love him with all she has to be able to forgive him for all that he has done...lying and cheating
She should of held on to her Pride and not got involved and listened to all his lies

I was the wife			

I think for me this song represents the side of the other woman in an affair that went bad.
""Guess I should have been More like her"" is in reference to the wife in this song. She believes if she had those qualities the wife has that he would have stayed.
""You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart, and then you realized you wanted what you had""
I think the man in this song played both sides of the fence. The other woman knowing about the wife, while the wife was unaware. When the guy gets caught he chose the woman he had been with all along. 
""I should have held on to my pride, I should have never let you lie"" I think here she's saying that she should have believed in her intuition that he was lying about how his marriage really was and she let him fill her head with lies about a future together. 
"" forgiving you, she's stronger than I am."" And  ""It's plain to see, desperation showed it's truth, you love her, she loves you with all she has"" when it came down to the affair and all the lies, she learns it was never a question of him leaving his wife because that was never his intention and the wife forgives him for the affair but the other woman can not get past what he's done to her.

That's how I see this song. As a scorned lover who realizes the guy she thought was going to choose her in the end is really a douche bag who never deserved her in the first place!!!

@Atleysceneit 















Maybe she is speaking from the wife's perspective....maybe her husband cheated on her and when she realized it, took him back, and as they were trying to rebuild their marriage, he (unfortunately) realized he ""wanted what he had"".  So he leaves to go back to her. Therefore, she wishes she was more like her.

I was the ""wife""

			Oh I really like the way you think here! That is a good interpretation never thought about it that way!			






			Oh I really like the way you think here! That is a good interpretation never thought about it that way!			

really good song. gets right to your heart.

i think this song is about a guy who already has a girlfriend but is cheating on her with another girl whom maybe he used to be with, so they already have history and once deeply cared about each other. the other girl obviously knows what he's doing is wrong, but she loves him so she's willing to do whatever with him. so their fling goes on for awhile and obviously his girlfriend doesn't find out, but then one day he just ends it and stops talking to her. of coarse she's upset about that because she really cares about him,

""I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie""

and now she thinks that she should have been more like his girlfriend and maybe he would've kept going.


i'm not sure if that's right, but i also agree with lollipop.

My interpretation of this song is that he was dating a new girl and then went back to his ex.

I've read that this song is especially personal to Miranda.  I sincerely hope she wasn't dating a man who was cheating on his girlfriend/wife.  I like her too much as a songwriter and singer to think she'd do something like that!

@SuperstarSinger 















this song is one of my favorite songs, period.
it related to my entire life a month ago.
I was talking to a guy for over a year who kept on telling me I'll break up with my girlfriend over and over, but he never would and I was giving up and to me it means
that the ""other girl"" is wanting to be with him but she's realizing that he won't leave her.

@fergerxxoo 















I have always loved this song, but unfortunately recently I was in a situation just like this. It was heartbreaking, and this song has been on repeat since.

I interpret the song as a guy who is in a serious relationship with someone, yet he has another woman. This woman is the one singing the song. He eventually breaks up with his girlfriend, and chooses to finally be with the other woman. After awhile, he realizes he wants what he had, and leaves her. The other woman is heartbroken and thinks that if she had only been better, more like his last girlfriend, she could have still had him.

@GMarie220 















I do agree that this song could be about a guy dating a girl and realizing he wanted what he has/had before. To me personally, however, it has a different meaning. To me, the two girls are the same person. My boyfriend and I broke up about a week ago because of many reasons, but one reason is that we have both changed and he wants the girl I was when we started going out a year and a half ago. 
""You had it all for a pretty little while
And somehow you made me smile when i was sad""
He liked me independent and able to handle my own problems and do everything on my own, but then I got used to him being there for me and was probably too dependent on him for everything. Then he realized he liked me better the way I was, not the way I am now. We're currently on a break but planning on getting back together.

			I really like your view on this song mizliz. I have never thought about it this way and now that I have I can relate to it so much better. I am going through the same thing, we have not gotten to the point where we are taking a break I just constantly am saying im going to get better. And I do for a little but then something happens and we are back to square one.

And I do for a little but then something happens and we are back to square one. 			

the first time i heard this song it was a profile song of a girl that my boyfriend had had a fling with while we were broken up.
and i kind of interpreted it like this:
the girl singing the song had a fling with a guy who was on a break with his girlfriend and she knows what she did was wrong and she regrets it because she know that he will never have any respect for her again.  and the guy and his exgirlfriend get back together which makes the girl who had the fling with him envious of the way the his girlfriend carries herself, or in the songs words ""She's beautiful in her simple little way
She don't have too much to say when she gets mad
She understands she don't let go of anything
Even when the pain gets really bad
Guess I should've been more like that"".  and the fling regrets everything...saying yes to the boy, helping him lie, allowing him to hurt his ex, and the fact that the girl the boy was dating will never forgive the girl he had the fling with but she's forgiven him.
and i think that the boy and the girlfriend don't stay together because of this lyric ""I guess you got what you deserverd"" and in the end, the girlfriend walks away with her pride, the fling is envy of the girlfriend, and the boy loses everything.

Hawrtbrayker: Bush contributed $87 billion dollars and several hundred thousand US troops to Iraq, a country with no association to the groups that attacked our country, and he's the one that is the only person who is willing to do something about terrorism? That is a ridiculous statement. Bush has done more to keep Bin Laden alive than anyone else. If he had spent that money and used those troops in Afghanistan and Pakistan, we'd have Bin Laden already. But we don't. And we won't, for a long time. President Bush drove us into a ditch. Do you really want to let him sit and spin the tires, or do you want to admit you were wrong and call a tow truck?

If Eminem really thinks his stupid little rhymes will influence Al Queda, his is just as naive as the rest of those left wing, hollywood types.  Yeah, lets use our words to get to Bin Laden and Al Queda...lets just talk with them about it.  Yeah, I'd like to see Eminem talk to Bin Laden....he'd be the next person on their home made videos getting his bleach-ass head cut off and then I won't have to listen to this crap any more.

Anyone who is ANTI-TERRORISM must be PRO-BUSH...I guess I mean anyone who is ant-terrorism and has a functioning brain....Eminem obviously doesn't.

Obviously you guy's don't get it that Eminem dosn't give a f*ck about what others think. Him being controversial is what he does, thats how he gets HIS money. Just becase half of the stuff he says he dosn't actually do, dosn't mean he might not actually feel what he means behind all it.

He is just angry, like alot of other people in this country. He's just lucky he gets paid to vent his anger.

@tarnok 















Funny thing, what he says doesn't matter.  He rants, he raves and we both can do it really.  I agree with tarnok, here.  I just saw the video on the GNN website, it is a slick infusion of rhymes and animation but it only goes so far.  This imagery of young people donning black hoodies and rampaging a state building to sign up to vote is completely and wholly unrealistic.  Gore Vidal said it best, he voiced that Democrats and Republicans are really two wings of the same party.  If the above scenarios were realistic, every black-hooded person would write Eminem in on the ballot and neither candidate would be elected.  Even if you crowd up all the young people to vote in Eminem, you could never amass the popular voting power of their elders (parents and grandparents) because they outnumber my generation twofold.  Bush and Kerry would still win the presidency.  The ones who are truly in charge, the ones who are truly threatened, would make sure every bit zealotry that is taken as truth by the masses would be vanquished before its taken on as an axiom in the arena of common sense.  It's common sense that anybody who is elevated to a position of popularity will surely turn out like their successors.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely and with human nature being what it is (social for survival unless egged on into conflict), I guarantee you Eminem would make a fabulous addition to that long list of political failures much like Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Jesse Ventura, Harry Truman, Elizabeth I, etc.  I foresee Schwarzenegger and Affleck becoming additions to that list.

The point is this:  songs like this bring out false hope and this is another song that falls on that false hope list.  They are unrealistic and only for the moment.  They don't offer a method for curing human nature.  If you want a truthful song about politics, ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" by The Who is maybe the best example that comes to mind about the perpetual state of politics and human nature.  That's true mood music if you want my opinion on the subject.  Eminem's deceiving himself, there is no way around the power-hungry aspect of human nature.  I am liberal in my heart but I'm both a realist and a liberal in my head, I'm torn like that.  

If this essay is removed from the boards, I sincerely apologize for torquing anybody off but I think it had to be said.

763,My Church.json,nil
764,My Dilemma.json,"
All her songs are straight-forward and simple. 

For this one, it's about having doubts (for lack of a better word) between leaving or going back with someone.
 After everything between her and this guy, even though they have a lot of problems that they need to work out, she keeps contemplating on if she should go back or not. Therefore, she's stuck with her personal dilemma where she can but can't live without this person and has to sing about it.

From the first moment I heard this song, I instantly thought of Nick Jonas as her personal Dilemma.

""I heard the rumors but you won't come clean,
I guess I'm hoping it's because of me.""
We all know that a few months before she recored this, he had a ""fling"" with co-star Samantha Barks when in London. Nick never admitted dating her, and I'm pretty sure Selena did know about her since she went to visit him at one of his shows back last year.

My interpretation of this song is it has to do with her ex boyfriend Jai Brooks.  They broke up, got back together, and were on and off.  Some of these lyrics support this too.  Although, I mainly think this song is about her grandfather passing.  It was a very emotional time for her and this song defines how close she was with him and that even though he is gone physically, he isn't mentally.

I wouldn't say it's a sad song. More of a proud song. His not sad that his getting old, but proud of himself and the way he accomplished his challenges throughout his life. He sums it up perfectly in the last verse. ""For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught."" It's a lovely song, and a modest one as well. Doesn't it make you feel that when your older you want to look back on your life and say, ""I did it my way"" and then smile? If the answer is yes then I guess Old Blue Eyes has made you feel exactly what he wanted you to feel.

"
773,National Anthem.json,"
This song is so powerful. And to me, it has a huge message that the video definitely embodied. 
 ----------------------------------
This is my take on the story the song tells:

She starts off having stars in her eyes for this rich and famous big shot guy who is taking here to parties and introducing her to this crazy luxurious lifestyle. He tells her to ""be cool"" and she's nervous because she's never been in this niche.

In the next verse, she gives an amazing metaphor for having sex. But this time, she says ""i'm already the coolest"" when he tells her to ""be cool"". she has figured out the lifestyle now and she has become a part of that world. now she isn't just asking to go to parties, she wants him to buy diamonds.

In the end of the song she has blended completely into this crazy lifestyle of guys, money, drugs, alcohol, fame, etc. She is no longer that naive girl that was first introduced at the beginning of the song. She has lost to herself to the fake world of ""fame"". She is the ""queen of Saigon"" or.. the queen of the fallen.



------------------------------

Lana tells this story and then towards the end talks about it being a ""love story of the new age"". Like, this is what the world has come to... People are obsessed with pop culture and these ""celebrities"" and ""socialites"". This crazed world of the famous is glamorized and the people in the spotlight often forget what's real and in the end all they have done is ruined their own lives, just as the girl in the story did.

Money HAS become the anthem of success. They are considered one in the same in modern times.

			Seems like not everyone grows up learning these terms... I guess I grew up with a silver spoon in my mouth. This song really strikes a chord with me because of my background and how people ""blur the line between real and fake"" ... how money is an anthem for many people... ""I just need somebody to hold me."" is probably my favorite... you can get so caught up in that kind of life, and sometimes you just really want the simplicities in life back... enough of the decadence.

			I've never really noticed that, but it really makes tons more sense now! Thanks!			

I actually don't think this song is about gold-digging as much as selling out to money, as a way to justify staying with her cheating lover/Kennedy because ""money is the reason we exist."" Obviously this is a twisted version of ""love is the reason we exist"", which I think would be the general consensus. But because she is somewhat starved of it, she's resigned herself to staying in an extremely unhealthy relationship because of the money. I don't think she ever intended to be a gold-digger at all initially, which is emphasised in her monologue in the extended video for the song. That isn't included here, but at the end of it she repeatedly states ""I loved him. I love him."" This is more evidence to suggest she was never in it for the money. I think this song has a very similar tone to Video Games actually, she's trying to convince herself he loves her like he should but isn't fooling anyone. There are very brief glimpses of her insecurity and desperation to be loved more than anything else, for example this is hinted at in the line ""I need somebody to hold me."" But on the exterior, and for most of the song, she tries to stay ""cool"" and pretend that she only cares about the money. I definitely think there's more to it than her simply staying in a relationship for the riches.

The thing that I love most about Imagine Dragons is that all of their songs sound like a battle cry. Sure they're not always angry battle cries, but they're always songs that make you want to yell them at the top of your lungs, and ""Natural"" is no different. Maintaining intensity throughout the entire song, it begins slow, but you can tell that something is going down. It suddenly turns into a battle cry about being strong in a world that's hard and cold. You listen and it makes you feel like you can run through a wall and throw that knockout punch. This song does an excellent job of making you feel exactly how the Imagine Dragons intended you to feel -- strong and hard and ready to take on the world.

@ReonataO 















Most people already know that Imagine Dragons are a Mormon Band and most of their songs have metaphorical religious meaning. Finding the religious meaning in this song is pretty black and white easy so that's likely why there are so little posts here, everyone already knows. But for the few of you who don't or just want to read an opinion. I'll write a simple explanation.

“Will you hold the line? When every one of them is giving up or giving in, tell me
In this house of mine? Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align? Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it? Cause this house of mine stands strong”

(The song is directed to the next generation, or the millennials. The line they are referring to is the line of tolerance. Moral values, and being a good person. There is a lot of hate and judgment coming from society and the world is filled with selfishness. In my opinion, the term “this house of mine” is referring to his people or his generation or his society. In today's society, the next generation is not upholding the values like we used to and are lowering the line. Things that were once considered wrong and immoral are being labeled as acceptable. This generation is giving up on trying to uphold those good things. The singer then asks God if He will save us.)

“That's the price you pay Leave behind your heartache, cast away Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a... Natural A beating heart of stone. You gotta be so cold To make it in this world. Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat. You gotta be so cold Yeah, you're a natural”

(This verse and chorus are regarding the fact that people feel that in order to be accepted in today’s society, they have to be ok with everything that's wrong. In their heart, they know that these things are wrong but they have to cast those feelings away in order to fit in and be accepted. They would rather be mean and hateful and judgmental than receive it from others.)

( the rest of the song follows the same theme. Imagine dragons use a lot of metaphors in their writing so it's up to interpretation but this is definitely the general tone and meaning of the song. How you interpret the individual lines and words is up to you. And I'm pretty sure they want it that way. They want people to be able to interpret the song in their own way and tie to their own life.)

Well, I don't know what the song was actually written about. But personally the feeling I got when I listened to this song for the first time, is like. This man is in love with this woman. But this woman is keeping her distance, she's not loving him the way he wants her to love him(if that makes any sense). And the chorus is basically him justifying or describing her. On how she's so cold with him, maybe because she had to be that way to protect herself.

 'Will you hold the line?When every one of them is giving up or giving in, tell me In this house of mine?'. (He's saying like with all of the men that have tried to break your wall, will you let me in? will you make an exception for me?)
''Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me will the stars align? will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it? Cause this house of mine stands strong'' ( He's saying on how she keeps making him prove that he's worth it. He's asking her on when will it end that endless battle and when he says; 'this house of mine stands strong' , like saying that he's not going to give her up.
‘’That's the price you pay, leave behind your heartache, cast away. just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey’’. ( He’s explaining why she is like that, she leave ‘feelings’ on second term, to stay focus on things that won’t hurt her (like usually love does). And that she prefers to be selfish and rather be the one to hurt him, before he hurts her.)
‘’And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a Natural. A beating heart of stone, you gotta be so cold to make it in this world . Yeah, you're a natural. Living your life cutthroat, You gotta be so cold Yeah, you're a natural. ‘’( He’s saying on how she has that wall that won’t let anybody in, maybe because she’s scared to get hurt)

‘’Will somebody let me see the light within the dark trees' shadows and What's happenin'?
Lookin' through the glass find the wrong within the past knowin'
We are the youth
Call out to the beast, not a word without the peace, facing
A bit of the truth, the truth’’ (He’s asking on when will it end, when will she let go of the past and start living in the present with him)

‘’Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it’’ ( He’s saying on how this situation is making him miserable, but that he’s determined to be with her)

This is my interpretation of this song. Maybe it has nothing to with it, maybe I’m relating with a similar  personal situation. And this is the way that this lyrics spoke to me because I felt like I’m relating to this situation.

@eleinadzaid 















Have you ever heard a song and fell in love with someone’s voice? Yeah, that’s what happened to me here. I love how this song has such a catchy tune and when the beat drops – forget about it – it’s almost impossible to sit still and not sing along. What I love so much about this song is that it shows off the pure vocals and talent from lead-singer Dan Reynolds. I like how throughout the song his voice really fluctuates, the beginning of the song is him singing very naturally and as the chorus builds you can really hear the emotion grow in his voice and then the chorus crushes it and his voice is amazing.   

When you first listen to this song, you don’t really pay much attention to the lyrics because the sound itself is very catchy but when you actually pay attention to the lyrics you realize that this song actually has a very strong meaning. Part of the chorus is “A beating heart so stone, you gotta be so cold to make it in this world. Yeah, you’re a natural.” To me, this song stands for the fact that we live in such a dog-eat-dog world and to survive and make it in this world you have to be a little stone cold. Life throws a lot of crazy things at us that we don’t necessarily expect so to be able to build a thick skin in this world is important. We can only guess that Dan Reynolds has gone through a lot of hardships in his life and this song is a reflection on how he feels about the world.

@AngelXFlowers 















The singer divorced his wife not long before writing this song. He has said that the meaning of this song is about empowerment. In a sense that’s true, because it’s clear that she left him and this song enpowers him to continue on. 

This song is absolutely calling his ex wife a naturally cold person who is going to do well in this cold world. The breakdown references an “oath,” which I take to mean marriage, which he said he won’t break. But she did. So this song is an aggressive letter to his ex-wife.

Wow not a single comment? I adore this song. I love the album!! Basically about two people or a couple that get along so well nothing is forced, there's no awkward silences, they just ""click"" perfectly together, everything is ""natural"" between them. 

""You are the thunder and I am the lightning""

I love that line, that describes their chemistry, they create a storm when they're together, they're electric. She admires his confidence, or his self confidence rather, pretty much in admiration of him and their compatibility. She's pretty damn attracted to and smitten with this guy. :) x

After watching the video I have to say this song is about a couple that broke up they both feel the regrets of the break up but for some reason can't get back together, both feeling the lonliness and so they settle for the next best thing an imitation of the lost loved in the form of a stranger. ""Id rather hurt then feel nothing at all."" We all know after a break up how vulnerable we feel and in the video it shows just that.

@Dark Angel 35 















It's too true to be ignored.

Lady Antebellum initially struck me as an Alternative band, since I never heard any of their songs before, but after listening to 'Need You Now', I know they're not your average band. They're Country (best genre imo, also the genre of my favourite performer, Taylor Swift), and it took just one song to get me attracted to it.

I wow at the high level of truth inside one particular song, and I grow to like the song. Excluding Taylor's other 'true songs', NYN was one that struck me oh-so clearly. The lyrics were true. The tone was true. Everything was true.

Sometimes, songs like this scare me. Because they're so true, it's hard to believe it's just a song and not an autobiography.

One current situation like this is happening around me. Trust me, the lyrics are scarily true. I just hope things will improve.

You rock, Lady A. Continue shinin'. Love is with 'ya.

""Another shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door

GREAT lines.

""Guess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all""

Couldn't agree more with this line - It's a live and learn type experience. You learn from the hurt.

OK song, but the lyrics are goofy.  ""There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel.  It ain’t all that bright, but even though it’s subtle"".  That does not make sense.  Neon signs aren't really subtle, but if it wasn't bright, then it would be subtle, not even though or in spite of that fact.

Seems like some lazy lyrics, w/ the writer trying to make the words fit and rhyme.

"
786,New Americana.json,"
I actually think that the lyric is 'Viral mess, turned dreams into an empire' - the idea that nowadays someone can post a video of them singing, or a piece of their art or fiction or whatever and turn their 'dream' into a massive career to make money- 'an empire' and then now the success that she (not necessarily Halsey but the generation of person that she's singing about) has found has allowed her to 'roll with the Rockerfellas'  - the most powerful, the richest people...

The song itself is definitely about this new generation of people who are growing up now who are becoming more liberal and accepting of social and economic differences ('Hamptons-bound but we don't feel like outsiders at all'), sexuality (second verse), diverse music tastes (?)('Raised on Biggie and Nirvana) etc etc. 

But I also feel like there's an air of sarcasm or maybe even a challenge in the song - if we finally do claim the fallen city and spread these 'new and improved' attitudes will we really be making a difference? Will we really be the New Americana or will we simply be a new generation of the idiots before us? ('What kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately?') - what kind of dreams have you been exercising lately, your more interested in being a consumerist a follower of trends rather than a leader ( 'so we hold it down when summer starts' )- but can you hold down the city, these new ideologies once the summer ends? Can we BE the New Americana? 

Maybe I'm being too philosophical? Great political song, no wonder Halsey said that radios across America are 'terrified of playing it'.

Bad romance, turned dreams into an empire.
{1. Maybe name dropping without name dropping Lady Gaga who made a fortune, of course, with Bad Romance or 2. Someone taking their heartbreak and turning it into self-made success as we see in the next line}
Self-made success now she rolls with Rockefellers.
{Rags to riches, now in the same league as a historically rich and famous family}

Survival of the richest,
 {Making commentary on how in America, ""survival"" and ""success"" are synonymous with ""fame"" and ""fortune""}
the city's ours until the fall. 
{We have control until we mess up and have to rely on higher ranking individuals}
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound, but we don't feel like outsiders at all.
{We are diverse, we are still Americans even though we're not millionaires}

We are the new Americana,
{America is changing, this generation is changing it, we are the new face of America, not past stereotypes}
High on legal marijuana,
{Progress that has occurred because this generation fought for it}
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana,
{1.These people grew up listening to diverse genres of music, metaphor for acceptance, also confirms that the ""New Americana"" are 90's and early 2000's kids.}
We are the new Americana.

Young James Dean, some say he looks just like his father,
But he could never love somebody's daughter.
{James Dean in the 50's was a model for greasers/hoods, probably someone a parent would not want with their daughter}
Football team loved more than just the game
So he vowed to be his husband at the altar.
{Football players (i.e. people in the eye of the media) love other football players, homosexuality is now acceptable, more progress brought about by the ""New Americana"" generation}

We know very well who we are, so we hold it down when summer starts.
{Not sure about this one, but I'm sure it's some kind of figurative language}
What kind of dough have you been spending?
{Money, money, money}
What kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately?
{Something about how much money you spend on everyday things?}

So these are all the thoughts that I have so far, if you have any other opinions please don't hesitate to comment!

@19cachri I honestly see a lot more sarcasm in this song that you seem to. There are things about this generation I can respect, but I think that, in our postmodern society, progress is not actually possible, only profit. I.e., anything she says that sounds like optimism/etc is just catchy phrases to diversify the lyrics and make them appealing for radio play (ex, having a chorus with 'marijuana' in it).

""The city's ours until the fall"" brings Fight Club to mind.

""We know very well who we are, so we hold it down when summer starts"" alludes IMO to how a lot of Americans deny how insecure they really are as leftists (read the unabomber manifesto). Also, how we thrive on coffee during the weekday, and beer on the weekend, and we're so hyped for friday and hungover on monday that we really only have three productive workdays a week.

""What kind of dough have you been spending/what kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately?"" seems to be saying that spending the dough is blowing your money, i.e. bubblegum is a waste of money, a lot of our consumerism is a waste of money.
I think hourly workers often forget that every eight dollars or so they spend is about an hour of gritting their way through work. I think they often forget to compare the quality of life lost by going to work with the effect their purchase has on their quality of life.

""It's this idea of these kids who are part of a generation where pop culture is so heavily influential that diversity doesn't scare them the way it scared our parents and their parents. We're more accepting of different walks of life,"" Halsey explained to MTV News. ""So I think the New Americana is racially ambiguous, people who are proud of their culture and they own it, possibly not from a binary of gender.""

I believe this song is about a new generation. I believe that this song describes a new generation that rose up to dominate the current goverment or higher power. If you watch the video, you will see that there is what I believe is a resistance. Halsey is pictured as the leader and she is taken from their base deep in the jungle. From here she is taken to a small town, where they planned on burning her at the stake. But causally, the townspeople intervene help her escape. After the climactic part of this ""story"" I inferred that the resistance is being watched because they are outliers. The lyrics, ""raised on Biggie and Nirvana"" tells that they are have a unique personality. As some people lye on the side of the punk and other the side of the rapper, this specific group of people combine to make a society in which we have now. When Halsey sings the line ""survival of the richest"", it relates to a world like we have now. The governments and higher powered organizations are ruled by rich ring leaders. And then when she sings ""until the fall"" it talks about when they run out of money to spend, their time is done. The line ""we hold it down till sommer starts"" is what I believe to be some kind of metaphor. Finally, I'll address the main idea of this song. The songs title is New Americana, which is what we live in now. Nowadays people are more excepting to sexuality, race, and religion than ever before. Our current millennials have strayed from normal tradition and they have crafted a excepting world. When someone screams out vulgar messages on social media that insult the gay community or the community that varies by different race, people stand up and don't stop fighting until they get justice. This is what I believe the meaning of the song to be, but it could be different to you. Only the writer (Halsey) could fully answer this question.

I feel like the song is about how this generation is learning to accept people for who they are. Though there is still bullying and stereotypes going on today, after hearing others stories we slowly begin to realize what we’ve been doing to them and changing our ways. I’m gonna try to explain what I think each sections means:

Verse 1: Something living their dream after being torn apart multiple times and showing others who told them they couldn’t do it that they could

Verse 2: How we are expecting Homosexuals and Bisexuals into our everyday life

Verse 3: How we’re finding out who we are and what we mean and that if you think differently about our choices, than you need to rethink them because we’re going nothing wrong.

Chorus: I’m pretty sure that this part means that we need to all learn how to accept others for who they are. Like when she says “but we don’t feel like outsiders at all” it’s directing towards how we don’t care how others act/look as long as their happy. And when she says “We are the New Americana” it means that we (the new generation) not only growing in technology but as people as well. There are many people out that who are gay, lesbian, bi, depressed, have anxiety and a lot more and we’re showing the world that we need to learn to accept others for not how they look, but for who they are. Wars and protests are going on because we never learn from our mistakes and we’re trying to show everyone where we’re going wrong, and when we try we get torn down and called assholes! This is why we need more singers like TØP, Melanie Martinez and, of course, Halsey. They all sing about loving them self and others. They bring up things like different kinds of abuse, suicide, mental dissorders and sexualities. We need more people like that or else they rest of the time we have on this world will be spent fighting each other. Also how people (mostly parents) wonder why their children cut and want to kill themself when the answer is THEM! Us (as children and teens) are growing up in this new generation where we are expressing who we really are and are finally being able to climb out of the tomb that our parents have buried us in. And with the messages that aritists like this are bringing are helping, and this is ONLY the beginning!

The last verse isn't complete.

this where the haters is
this why they hate us here
this why i hate it here
though love it, I made it here
we all here, from the dealers to the kids
to the squares to the fly
one thing we are aligned with
black on black Nikes
that represent the lifeless lives
and it reflects the plight of those fighting so
if we ain't right and always at the throats
of one another at least we got our Goadome Nikes a
metaphor, for the insecure
if you ain't wearing no color, can't nobody say nothing
one can never be judged when he dress like his brothers
melancholy we are though we all learn to love it
pessimistic we are
carry odds like luggage
and thru all our troubles
we still walk around walk around
(flyer than the rest of em)
flyer than the rest of em
flyer than the rest of em
and still got my Nike Boots

What a great song.  It's about how we're all just trying to live and fit in but that somehow constantly puts us at each others throats.

a lot of drama
a lot of beef
we have so much in common, starting at the feet

best lines in the song :)

I think this song is about people having an affair and stealing moments to have sex. 

""Oh, we both know the truth
If it were the real me and you
This wouldn't be the right thing to do""

They are both leaving their identities as partnered adults for a moment and putting them aside. They both know it is wrong to have sex with each other but they are doing it anyway.

""It's too late to run away from it all
It's too late to get away from it all
I'm done with running so I give it to you""

They can't run away from their commitments but they can give their bodies to each other.

""This moment has caused a reaction
Resulting in a reattachment
Girl, you take me to Nirvana
I don't think this will last
'Cause you're here in my arms""

Nirvana is a state of bliss. The ecstasy of illicit lovemaking cannot last forever because the partnered woman can only be in his arms for a short time.

 ""Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, we both feel the same
I'm not gonna give you my name
And I don't think you want that to change""

He's not going to marry this woman and give her his surname. He knows she doesn't want a commitment, just some fun on the side with him.

""We're in this together
We don't know who we are
Even if it's moving too fast
Maybe we should take it too far""

They are both being bad together and they don't even recognize themselves because of what they are doing. He's telling her to go ahead and cheat with him no matter what the consequences.

@aaronplane 















When I hear this song, the melancholy, aching strain, contrasted with the lyrics reflecting on the emptiness of a desperate physical connection... I think of it as social commentary on today's ""hookup culture"" where people seek love, get hurt somehow and also jaded by society's expectation (""give her my name""), despair of finding true love, and instead experience the ""nirvana"" of the present moment.

From Wikipedia, ""nirvana"" means ""blown out"" (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…):
""In the Buddhist context nirvana refers to the imperturbable stillness of mind after the fires of desire, aversion, and delusion have been finally extinguished. In Hindu philosophy, it is the union with Brahman, the divine ground of existence, and the experience of blissful egolessness""

There is the heartbreaking detachment when having sex without committed desire, that has its own bittersweet beauty.

797,No Goodbyes.json,nil

The song starts out massive, sounding like something big is about to happen. It then lowers, almost as if its sneaking up but then BAM. It's there.

""And it feels right this time
On his crash course with the big time""

He's basically saying that he feels good that his time to be ""big"" has arrived. Yo
u feel his anticipation in the rhythm.

""Pay no mind to the distant thunder
New day fills his head with wonder, boy""

He chooses not to focus on the risks of his decision because its distant. Instead ponders the rewards the new day is going to give him.

""Says it feels right this time
Turned it 'round and found the right line""

He's assuring himself that his time to be ""big"" has come. He's glad he turned his life around, and he found the ""right line"".

""“Good day to be alive, sir
Good day to be alive,” he says""

His excitement and assurance is palpable.

""Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way""

Tunnels are like a shortcut, so instead of working hard to climb over the hill, he decided to take the shortcut and go through it. The light at the end of his tunnel wasn't the beginning of a new better life, but that of a train. The train was the risk he chose to ignore.
The second time this verse is repeated, the beat picks up, and he's realizing that his decision wasn't well thought out.

""Don't it feel right like this?
All the pieces fall to his wish""

He comes to the realization that this was what he was asking for. He hadn't thought it through. Any shortcuts to something this big aren't going to come without risk. Everything had gone down to this moment, and now he has nothing.

""“Sucker for that quick reward, boy
Sucker for that quick reward,” they say""

Other people ridicule him for not thinking.

""Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
Was just a freight train coming your way
It's coming your way""

He knows its going to hit him, and hard.

""Then it comes to be
Then it comes to be""

It's happening. He losses everything.

This song is about knowing what your getting into. Any shortcut to a rich life comes with big risks. You have to think things through before you delve into them, otherwise it will come back to bite you.

I would not say ""unexpected"". See the third line:
""Pay no mind to the distant thunder""
That means the storm is coming, he should have foreseen it, but instead, he just is too focused in another things:
""Beauty fills his head with wonder, boy...""
It's liek some guy who has a good time, and thinks that nothing can go wrong, but because of this optimism he fails to see the signs that something bad is going to happen, so he is unprepared.

@ddarkpassengerr 















This song, is EPIC on so many levels.

First and foremost, I definitely think this song is a testament to Eminem's perseverance in the game. He has pushed his skills to a new dimension and timezone, surpassing Jay-Z and Nas (yet i feel, nas is still lyrically up there) easily. I'm not going to compare Pac or Biggie, cuz they have passed away...but in terms of rapid delivery, with lyrical creativity, EM easily pushes Twista 3x.

He changes up the tempo of his delivery to rhythmically create vocals that are instrumental on their own.

The only thing i found a little odd was his use of the word, ""fellow"" because i feel that word is dated, but when he rhymed it with ""You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow"", it totally is acceptable.

There has been some words, floating on the internet, that EM, was a bit ticked that Lil Wayne, and Kayne were getting attention, when he clearly felt that they --- for the most part were a bit over-rated.

Well...you know how that saying goes. Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer?
That's what Eminem did. He did an Encore of Drake's Forever, and forever put lil wayne to shame, while grabbing the mic from Kayne, and sent him home, without a pen to his pad---jaws wide open, gag ball and all. Kayne is a plucked chicken.

In stead of stooping to Pac and Biggies level, Jay-z's and Nas's rivalry, and 50's and The Game's kiddy fest....

EM, takes his adversaries, raps with them, and puts them to SHAME!

Seriously, i think lil wayne is a joker, and needs to re-evaluate his style. It was cool with the Carter III, because it was ""new/edgy"" and took the world by storm, but now its repetitive, banal, and done. Lil Wayne sounds like his talking, there is no real delivery...like his technique is Juvenile compared to Em's. When Wayne speeds up his vocal delivery, it sounds like the start of Em's part.

I love the way Em rips on Kanye, i'm sure Taylor Swift is gonna be bumping this tune in whatever car she drives.

What i want? I want EM and NAS, to collaborate, and have DRE produce that shit. That's what i want to see...Not Wayne and Kanye, they both wanksta's.

Drake, has some potential, but lyrically his subject work is cliche. 40, is a good producer for him...i feel drake can easily eclipse Wayne and Kayne, but has miles before he can touch Nas, Jay, biggie, Pac, or EM.

EM IS ON TOP...and in the books forever. 

TOO $HORT should start taking notes.


Peace out!

""Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?""

-----------------

You're right, it 'could' be a suggestion for him, calling out to Kayne to get ""whack cocksuckers off stage""

------------------

""Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute
Yeah the rap is tight
But I'm fucking with the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones""

--------------------

But the rest of this verse for the most part insinuates otherwise. In a literal sense, ""cocksuckers"" is plural, where in this stanza, ""snatch the mic from him"" is a singular reference. Eminem, a perfectionist, at this stage of the ""game"" is recognized as a technical lyricist. This verse, can be seen in two different lights, but to me, it seems as a, not-so-subtle multiplex of skipping stones creating everlasting ripples, taking some pacquiao'esq jabs at kayne.

Another take on the Kayne reference is, that bringing fourth Kanye to take the Mic, ""as an dignifying gesture"" but that Eminems rap is sooo ""disgustingly sick"", that I have to snatch the mic from Kayne...hence ""Snatch the mic from him""...

Either way, It's taking stabs at Kayne in some way or another, but if south park can get away with, ""fishdicks"" then, Em, can prolly get away with verbal murder.

Why wouldn't you want to compare Eminem, Pac, and Biggie...Here I will do it for you...Biggie is garbage and the absolute biggest piece of shit to ever get a record deal...So Eminem wins that one...2Pac is a lyrically god as Eminem...So this is where the comparison gets good, both rapped about real life...2Pac was the first of is kind, and you clearly see the influence of Pac in Eminem...We have no idea how long Pac's career would of lasted because he died young...So, we can't really continue or know for sure is better, but this is what I will say...Eminem just turned 37, which by that time most artists are retired unless they are country, and nobody likes that shit anyway, so forget about that...Eminem just released what is perhaps the greatest album of all time from any genre...Every song could easily be a number 1 single...He already has 3 songs from the album to reach number 1...If he has his next single hit number one it will tie the most singles to hit number 1 from one in history, right behind michael jacksons thriller...So Eminem may not only be the best rapper of all time...Perhaps the greatest artist of all time, the man is legend in has own right, and deserves the credibility that people get...

The start of the song explains how Ariana is in a blissful state of mind and she doesn’t want to change it. She has finished crying herself and hence no more tears left to cry. Breakups, deaths, relationships, life and so many other things could related to this song. But what you can do is, pick yourself up, love yourself and dust yourself and move on-as life does.

Does this mean she is cold hearted? Maybe, maybe not. But the important thing is she is in a process of healing and she loves not to be broken again.

""They point out the colors in you, I see ’em too
And, boy, I like ’em, I like ’em, I like ’em""

‘Colors’ intend to mean the characteristics of a person. We often say no person shows their ‘true colors’ to the world, unless they are put in the spotlight. Flaws and imperfections are part of the deal in human nature. So either you learn to accept them or learn to not get involved with anything at all.

Quote from JustRandomThoughs, ""We believe this is a good song with a sensible meaning by Ariana Grande. We cannot help but think “No Tears Left to Cry” was also inspired by the tragic bombing incident that happened at the Ariana’s 2017 ‘Dangerous Woman’ concert in Manchester in 2017.""

I always love a song that allows me to sassily shout “shut your mouth” on my commute home from work. 

That’s right, Ariana Grande is back to narrate your post-breakup feels and she. Is. Over. It. By the time we find Ariana, she is done grieving her old relationship…she doesn’t have any more energy to put into being sad and she’s ready to start feeling herself again. She talks about being on another plane of existence...she’s transcended normal breakup grieving and has found her own enlightenment. In a song that mixes pop with some one-off techno, in combination with Ariana’s naturally breathy singing voice, this song really does give you the feeling that you're in another world. You and Ariana are together on this breakup healing journey and she’s letting you know that you both have a bright and happy future.

I can't believe no one has commented on this song. It's definitely worth a listen, although I have mixed feelings about it. I am drawn to Blake's plaintive vocal, and if he asked my inner 16 year old not to ""go loving on nobody but me"", I'd say, ""Yes, Blake!"" But on closer inspection, his claim that nobody else would love the girl enough to cry for her is controlling and manipulative.

806,Nobody's Lonely Tonight.json,nil
807,Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown).json,"
The meaning of this song is explained. It is credited to Lennon/McCartney although it seems Lennon wrote most lyrics.


""I came in and he had this first stanza, which was brilliant: 'I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.' That was all he had, no title, no nothing. I said, 'Oh yes, well, ha, we're there.' And it wrote itself. Once you've got the great idea, they do tend to write themselves, providing you know how to write songs. So I picked it up at the second verse, it's a story. It's him trying to pull a bird, it was about an affair. John told Playboy that he hadn't the faintest idea where the title came from but I do. Peter Asher had his room done out in wood, a lot of people were decorating their places in wood. Norwegian wood. It was pine really, cheap pine. But it's not as good a title, Cheap Pine, baby...
So she makes him sleep in the bath and then finally in the last verse I had this idea to set the Norwegian wood on fire as revenge, so we did it very tongue in cheek. She led him on, then said, 'You'd better sleep in the bath'. In our world the guy had to have some sort of revenge. It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn't the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn't, it meant I burned the fucking place down as an act of revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental.""
Paul McCartney
Many Years From Now, Barry Miles


Norwegian Wood is a fake wood that was used to make cheap furniture. Lennon knew people who were using it in their homes and thought it would make a good title.
There are not many lyrics in this song, but they tell the story of a man who gets invited to a girl's house. When she won't let him into her bed, he sleeps in the tub. When she leaves the next morning, he sets the place on fire. It was one of the first songs Lennon wrote that told a complete story.

Norwegian Wood is a type of very cheap pine. It burns quickly. Paul says it was his idea to burn the place down in the song. John says there was no one woman he was thinking about when he wrote this song, but that he was having so many affairs at the time, he wrote it in such a way as to keep his first wife Cynthia from getting suspicious. It has also been suggested that the woman in the song was the actress, Natalie Wood. As an actress, she would need to get up early to be on the movie set. John did meet a number of starlets in Hollywood during their tours, including Jayne Mansfield, but Natalie Wood has never been documented. With John's love for word play, it's plausible he would change ""Natalie"" to ""Norwegian"", but I doubt this.

This is a clever little song about revenge, which seems odd for the Beatles, but the sly twist makes it more humorous than cruel.  He sets up by saying he once 'had' a girl, meaning he had her where he wanted her, or so he thought.  In fact, it was she who 'had' him, as in yanked his chain.  She made him think he was going to get lucky, but all she really wanted was his company for a few hours.  

So, the girl invites him to her place, and he is expecting to get it on with her.  Instead she prattles on and on until 2 AM, talking about irrelevant things and trying to impress him: ""Look at this place, it's made of Norwegian wood.  Isn't it good?""  So he's been waiting all this time for her to put out, but she instead decides it's time for bed because she has to get up early.  She does not invite him to sleep with her (thereby the song hints that they didn't do what he was there expecting to do--have sex); annoyed, he goes off to sleep in the tub, which is no doubt very uncomfortable.  

When he wakes she's gone; she didn't even have the decency to wake him up and say goodbye.  So what does he do?  Burns down her precious Norwegian wood house. :-)

			I always took ""lit a fire"" to mean smoke either a cigarette or some weed			

Reading all of these postings I became fascinated - OK obsessed -with all of the interpretations of this song.  I thought I knew what the song was about, but apparently not.  I decided to send out a poll to family and friends (ages 28 through 60) to get their opinions. I asked them 3 questions:
1) Was one person seducing the other, and if so which one?
2) Did they have sex>
3)What does “Norwegian wood” refer to, and how does it relate to the fire at the end?

Suprisingly enough - with the 15 responses I got as many - maybe more - than are found here.
1) 7 people thought that she was seducing him, 1 thought he was seducing her, the remainder thought it was either mutual or weren't sure.
2)10 thought they did not have sex, while 5 thought they did.
3) 3 people thought he burned furniture in the fireplace, 2 people thought he was smoking marijuana, 2 people though he burned the place down, 4 people thought that that Norwegian wood referred to logs in the fireplace, and 2 people thought the setting was Norway and that it referred to the forest outside.

Despite the relatively few answers to these questions, it resulted in a myriad of combinations, so only a few peoples' interpretations of the song coincided : e.g. she seduced him, they had sex and he threw a table in the fire vs. she seduced him, they didn't have sex and he lit the fire in the morning, vs.....
And interesting point, a couple reserached the song, were surprised by the arson theory, and flat out rejected it. 

As for my own interpretation - - it was similar to azaud’s.  I also feel compelled to discount the arson theories based on the meoldic nature of the tune and the tone of the lyrics. 

Great discussion on everybody's part.

If you will actually read ANYTHING online instead of talking out of your ass you will realize what this song is truly about.

It is about his journey into Recovery (hints the Albums' name) and sobriety.  He struggled with drug addiction & has been able to overcome his disease.

At any rate, the lyrics are easy to understand to anyone in recovery as they are based on the 12 Step/AA/NA/etc views & slogans/sayings about recovery and our disease.

He is Not Afraid to take a stand and face his demons and the wreckage of his past.  For myself, I continued to use because of the guilt, shame and remorse of my actions the previous day(s), weeks, months and then years; so he is willing to face those things and recover from his addiction.  If you will read his Wikipedia page and the Wikipedia page for this song it will give you some insight into his addiction and ultimately his recovery from the progressive illness he and I are afflicted with.

In the chorus I believe that Eminem is coming back full force out of a deep depression and a dark time in his life. He is saying that he's coming back without worries of regression. He's also saying that if anyone else has the problems he had he knows what they are going through and he will lift them up. Eminem is saying that no matter how hard life gets you will have people to lift you up along the way and people have been down the road before you and you are able to come back from it because others were able to.

@baron11 















I'm wondering if anybody really knows what this song is about.  Some of it is just small talk but the overall message is about recovery from addiction.  In a 12 step program, our main goal is to recover & help others recover from addiction. That's why he says ""Everybody come take my hand, we'll walk this road together.""  The whole ""not afraid to take a stand""... in my opinion has to do with an addict's ego because when we let go of the drugs, one of the first things we have to deal with is our ego because we're always worried about what other people will think about us quitting drugs or what others will think about the fact that we even did drugs.  When he says, ""thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this f-ing black cloud still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons, these motherf-ers are doin' jumpin' jacks now!""  A lot of times, in recovery we try to do things our own way & we think we can.. and most of us never really understand why we are so addicted, or why even when we have stopped doing drugs or alcohol for a long period of time, we are still an addict and/or alcoholic (this f-ing black cloud still follows me around)... so we have to always work against the disease to keep it at bay (but it's time to exercise these demons). The line, ""These motherf-ers are doin' jumpin' jacks now!"".. if you haven't been in recovery, you would never know what he's talking about. Addiction/alcoholism is a progressive disease whether you're using or not and they say the whole time you're clean, your addiction is still getting stronger, doing jumping jacks in the back of your mind.
My favorite verse of the whole song is the last one, where he says, ""Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub & lift the whole liquir counter up cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing & I'm not afraid...""  He is saying that he is strong enough in his recovery to put himself in a tempting situation without giving in. LOVE THIS SONG!!!!

I read through some of the comments before writing my own opinion of the song's meaningful nature.  Some of them were useless and a whole lot'a babble, others were religiously based, which made me want to gague and roll on the floor, and occasionally some good points were mentioned.  My interpretation of the song will probably have the same reactions to the ones I'd seen above or worse of ones.  So, here I go, I'll try and summerize as best I can!

Nothing Else Matters-Metallica

When I'd first heard this song I was stumped, I didn't know what they were talking about, how could such a melody have lyrics of such dark nature, well, this is how I percieve it after replaying it to the point of having 567 plays on my Itunes:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Comment: The narrator speaks of a first love, or maybe even a true love after searching many years for him/her (perhaps also a signifacant other).  In love we need to trust, and even more so in ourselves.  The narrator says that in love trust and being true to your heart is all that matters.

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Comment: The narrator is opening himself to him/her like a book, telling secrets and sharing things he/she'd of never imagined sharing.  He/she is having a spur of reality, rebellion even, deciding that their life is their own and that he/she is determined to live it how they want no matter what people say.  Being true to you is all that matters.

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Comment:  The narrator now is finding a sense of belonging and trust in their significant other, learning new things and keeping an open mind towards what's happening.  Being open and willing to change is all that matters.

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

Comment: The narrator is accusing people of not caring enough for their actions and shaming them for not using their knoweledge.  He says he knows, something of the reality.  Perhaps a break in the trust? 

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Comment: The narrator repeats himself, obviosuly destressed from some event, telling you that he/she needs to stay true to themselves and rebuild a trust.  Again, he/she says that trust and staying true is all that matters.

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know

Comment: Now we know there has been a break somewhere between then and now.  The narrator tells us that they don't care about their actions, that they're playing games and know it.  He/she might appear oblivious to what's going on, but he/she makes it clear that they KNOW what's happening, that they have and still do.

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters

Comment: The song ends with a specific cluster of lyrics, saying that you need to trust in you and not others.  He/she says that no matter how far you are, or how close you are to love or something more than what you have, always stay close and true to you, that's all that matters.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anyway, that's my disection of the song, and how I interpreted it so many times over.  Feel free to agree and disagree, but that's how I see it.  A song is a song and a song holds a meaning; how we as individuals take in that meaning is how we as individuals will learn to appreciate the song as a piece of art, and even at times, a part of us.  We relate and understand things differently, hope this helped!

I think you are dead on. However, I think this song is a bit more positive which might be the genious behind the instrumental. 

First, I think when he says ""They,"" he doesn't mean this significant other, because he refers to that person with the word ""you."" I think when he says ""they"" he means the world.

Secondly, I think this song is more about love. Meaning these two people fall so much in love with each other to where he doesn't care about ""they"" do, but only cares about the other person. - And nothing else matters

Finally, as you stated, the end has one difference in the lyics: ""Forever trusting who we are"". To me this tells me there wasn't a break in trust from when he said ""but I know"", but it is stating they forever have this bond. - I think the ""but I know"" means that nobody else knows what the ""lovers"" have, but he does.

NOTE: This could be about family or a friend, but I read it as strong relationship between two people.

@00Birdie00 I wanted to explode the entire planet when I think that some person out there, which is you, could be so incredibly delusional, cringeworthy and unaware of his stupidity. And that goes for any repliers who even in the slightest agree with him. How the hell does this song talk about a love of a significant other? You're looking too deep into the lyrics and giving your ego's intellectual/deep identity a fucking blowjob. The lyrics are straight forward which when u said u listened hundreds of times and couldn't figure it out made me wanna face palm my head to the center of the earth. It's about being different and not fitting into what ""they"" mainstream society think/know/do it's about being who you are and having the best most adventurous life because of it. And nothing else matters.			






			Amazing :) 			

			awesome i agree but... i dont think its bout... like a guy or girl that means a lot to him but his parents and and how they are going through caner or whatever... thats what i heard anyways but great response and it really does make me think every time i listen to a metallica song. btw if i come off as ignorant or stupid or something like that im not im 14!!!! :3 cheers tho now i kinda get it and i keep trying to do the same with other songs now like trying to analyse them :3			

			That to me is 100% on the ball! It makes perfect sense to the music, and the way he sings the different parts of the song. Even the parts that repeat he sings them differently and the music changes! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS!! Metallica is one of my favorite bands and this song kind of stumped me. Metallica puts so much meaning in their music, and as a listener I love hearing what other people think.

This is a very special song to me. My mom tells me everytime she hears it that its going to be her funeral song. She tells me because the song means that no matter what happens in life, who you meet, the things you do...remember who you are. Dont let what people think about you and what they what you to be change you. always ""true in who you are"". The person you truly are. And if you always remember exactly who you are, nothing else in life matters.

This song is what you'd get if you made the poem Invictus into a beautiful love song. There are two threads to it, the first thread is the love song:

""So close, no matter how far""
    We're emotionally close even when we're physically apart
""Couldn't be much more from the heart""
    I love you from the bottom of my heart
""Never opened myself this way""
    I've never opened up to someone like I have with you
""Forever trusting who we are""
    We'll always believe in ourselves and each other
""Trust I seek and I find in you""
    I need someone I can trust and it's you
""Every day for us something new""
    We're not growing stale, every day of our relationship feels exciting and new
""And nothing else matters""
    Nothing matters but our love
""All these words I don't just say""
    I'm not just saying these words, I mean them

The second thread is a fierce ""declaration of independence"", a rejection of the rest of the world:

""Life is ours, we live it our way""
    We'll live how we want, not how others tell us to
""Open mind for a different view""
    We see the world with our own eyes and that gives us a different view.
    We don't copy the unexamined opinions of others.
""Never cared for what they say""
    Other people gossip and disapprove but we ignore those fools
""Never cared for games they play""
    Other people play games and don't mean what they say but we ignore those fools
""Never cared for what they do""
    Other people do bad or stupid things but we ignore those fools
""Never cared for what they know""
    Other people gossip but we ignore those fools
""And nothing else matters""
    The rest of the world doesn't matter, only our love matters

A couple more points:
- The words ""nothing else matters"" tie together the two threads.
- For me, although the melody feels dark and dramatic, which might seem out of place in a love song, that power and anger emphasize how strong the singer's love is.

No matter why you listen to an artist, everyone likes to listen to them for different reasons and that should never be scrutinized by the likes of someones mind, such as the user 'no one important'.

Since that LyricFind thing overwrote them, here are the correct lyrics from the booklet that I originally submitted:

Who knows how long
I've been awake now?
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me
Beckoning...
Who knows what's right?
The lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on
There's nothing left to say now...
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...
There's nothing left to say now...
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...
Below my soul
I feel an engine
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it out
I've come too far
To see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
I keep pushing on and on and on and on
There's nothing left to say now...
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...
There's nothing left to say now...
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...
I keep falling, I keep falling down...
If you could only save me
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul
There's nothing left to say now...
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...
There's nothing left to say now...
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...

To me, this song seems to strongly convey someone who is struggling with something, an addiction or relationship mainly, maybe even suicidal depression. It all seems to just fit. ""Who knows how long I've been awake now? The shadows on my wall don't sleep. They keep calling me, beckoning."" This line starts the song off, and sets the mood for it. The ""shadows"" are the temptations and whispers in the struggling person's ear that never go away, that must always be fought. ""Who knows what's right, the lines keep getting thinner. My age has never made me wise, but I keeping pushing on, and on, and on, and on."" This line makes the point to say ""It's not black and white anymore."" The line between right and wrong is much grayer than before. The artist goes on to say ""my age has never made me wise,"" Meaning time and experience with his struggles has made no difference. But he keeps on, he continues to fight, because he knows he has to. The chorus, however, conveys a different message. ""There's nothing left to say now. I'm giving up, yeah, giving up now."" At this point it's mental ping pong, the struggling person wants to fight, but he just can't. He wants to give up. ""Below my soul, I feel an engine, collapsing as it sees the pain. If I could only shut it out."" This line is a bit more cryptic, but what I think the artist means by ""engine"" is the driving force that has kept this struggling person alive. The last bit of him is collapsing as it sees his pain, and all he wants is to shut it out and give in. ""I've come too far to see the end now, even if my way is wrong. I'll keep pushing on."" This is one of the last hurrahs, saying he's come to far in the fight to watch himself fall, even if his lifestyle and way of going about it was all wrong, he continues to push on. Then the chorus again, conveying defeat. Now comes the bridge, ""I keep falling, I keep falling down, if you could only save me, I'm drowning in the waters of myself."" This is it, this is the end for this struggling person. He says how he keeps falling and failing, and that it's no use, because the very force and mind that keeps them alive is simultaneously killing them, that no one can save them from himself. And finally, he gives up. In the final and most dramatic chorus, he says, ""There's nothing left to say now, there's nothing left to say now. I'm giving up, giving up, yeah, giving up now."" This giving up could be breaking off a relationship, giving into an addiction, or even suicide. All in all, this song seems to be the story of someone who wants to fight their demons, but just can't survive the process. One of my favorite Imagine Dragons songs, maybe even my favorite song.

I agree, but at the end, I believe after the last chorus, the main character is in an epic battle and keeps fighting until the very end of the song. They may or may not win, but I believe the end is open to interpretation based on the listener.

By far the best imagine dragons song and my favorite right above demons.

There's just no f*cking hope, it doesn't matter how much you hold onto your infancy, you will lose what draws a line from your innocence once you reach the adulthood. And it may be a single moment when you suddenly realize you just don't care anymore about what just a second ago could make you so happy as a child... or it may be years later when you catch yourself lying to a kid exactly the way you hated so much being lied at.

Life with all its expectations, cruelty, greed and all sh*t will come forth eventually and truly eat your heart out from your body while it still beats in hot blood. There's no other way around... it will happen at some point. Just like you as a grown up adult will start vomitting all those crappy lies onto another children, making them swallow empty promises of others being able to heal their pain, empty and false hopes of answers to their fears, luring them into a world of an illusory freedom... 

... one can easily see how much everything out there wants you to grow up as fast as you can, all that marketing for children, high-tech games and toys for creating little consumers from the earliest age, or those freaky genius kids looking so adult on tv or cinema, 6, 7 years old people acting and speaking as adults, 10 years old girls in the streets wearing clothes, sometimes even sensual ones, as mini-adults who can't barely wait to be older and make hard mistakes for real, actually already feeling older for real... 11, 12 year old kids already knowing everything about sexuality....

... money, needs, drugs, tribal identification, all that crap that adults keep telling them like where you to belong to. As if they really could tell! As if anyone could really tell such thing to another being. As if an age difference could make you able to do so! Like f*cked up parents brainswashing kids with all kind of religion craps, trying to explaing complex philopshical concepts of God... or the complete opposite, parents simplifying everything down to right and wrong, good and evil...

It would be just great not having all that sort of basterds coming into our infancy door as soon as you do something wrong, scoring and cleaning your mess just to give you a sense of responsibility disguised in a forgiveness cloak to be planted in your heart just to steal you naivety.

Then you get close to death... when you finally get tired beyond even being or simply feeling older... that's when you see how much you wronged other that are today what you were so long ago... that's when you finally open your eyes and want so hard to get yourself back there... and it crushes you, it makes your heart weigh so heavily, your chest shrinks so hard that you just need to shout out to the children not let it all repeat itself again... begging them to rejoice, to lift their voices, begging them to make themselves be heard for their real voices... imploring them to simply have fun... admitting to yourself and whispering to them that no adult can really protect a kid from the world... it is a lie that only reflects this sick desire adults have to wax and mold their kids into what is clearly an individual vision of the world that only apply to the self...

and children are no f*cking third parts of other selves... nor a parent choice for they to correct their own mistakes... children are what they are... or at least they should be let be so...

damned times these now when children are less children... and go killing and shooting and growing up before even being able to really miss being... children themselves...

These comments are all really apt, but in the context of the album and its self-proclaimed adaptation of Orpheus & Eurydice, this song marks the moment after Orpheus has lost Eurydice to Hades forever, after which he pretty much wanders aimlessly into nothing until he's devoured by beasts. It's a bittersweet tragedy in which he laments his situation, but rejoices in its easy solution: death, where he can be reunited with his lost love for all eternity.

Really beautiful stuff. Makes a great story even better.

			Yeah, in another song Orpheus goes down to Hell (instead of the Greek place - which I believe might be the Underworld?). But then, he also ""hit a G-minor 7"" and woke God up: ""God was a major-player in Heaven."" So, aside from writing kickass lines all over the place, he pretty much hakes up the whole Orpheus & Eurydice story wherever he likes.

i personally think its talking about world war two because gulags are camps and in the end its talking about hopping on the train to the kingdom so its like when they took the jews to be killed by transportation of the trains and the kingdom is obviously heaven. at one part, it explains the nazis coming and breaking into the house and taking them out and another part explains how they would line them up in the street. 
but that is just my guess.

i found this song from harry potter and i think its just so soulful and beautiful.

Quite Marxist.  In other words, the adults love the next generation, but end up screwing it up unintentionally the way they were screwed up.  Just hand over your ""gun"", your rebelious spirit,  and let us teach you the secrets we all think we really know but we don't.  But in the end, even though we have brainwashed you into believing our ways are right, we can all still ride that same train home to a place where we will all be happy.

@mitigator 















I see it like this - 

1. The protagonist's generation of adults have f##ked up the world and built human systems which make it a generally horrible place (the ""gulag"", which in history is the ultimate example of the horrors people inflict on one another).  They have done this to their short term profit but long term detriment.

2. The protagonist feels he is about to die - by his own hand, perhaps, or at least unwillingly (""pass me that lovely little gun"", ""the light is dim"" etc).  At the same time, he and his peers have had the shocking realisation that they have lived worthless lives and made the world a worse place by forgetting their original values (""poor old Jim's white as a ghost/he's found the answer that we lost"")

3. He is speaking to his child, trying in his way to apologise and warn the child about the world that the adults have created.

4. He knows deep down that the message won't get through to the child (""there ain't nothing we can do to protect you""), and that the same type of people he once was (the ""cleaners"") will come to the child, and convince it that the ways of the world are good and correct, and that as an adult the child will subsequently participate in building and maintaining the very same system, the ""gulag"" - so ""here take these before we run away/the keys to the gulag"", i.e. the world, such as it is, is yours now.  

5. The ""cleaners"" will make is all seem like it is the right way for things to be by hiding the blood - ""the cleaners have done their job on you/they've hosed you down, you're good as new"" - i.e., when the child makes the same choices that the protagonist did, it will be because society is structured in a way that hides the true costs of those choices until it is too late.  Consumerism, supporting corrupt governments, ""righteous"" wars, etc etc.  To me the ""cleaners"" are governments, corporations, the media, and other manipulative people/groups who profit from the current system.

6. I find the gospel part at the end to be intentionally ironic - after selfishly wrecking the world and abandoning his child to its fate, he now has the temerity to ask God (or whoever) for salvation (getting him to ""the Kingdom"").  I think this part highlights that this is said slightly mockingly: ""we're happy Ma, we're having fun, the train ain't even left the station"", i.e., his generation have forgiven themselves and found 'salvation' and now they're back to having fun even though the ""train"" isn't necessarily going anywhere.  But there is also a real fear in there - ""have you left a seat for me? is that such a stretch of the imagination?"", i.e., after all I've done, is it even possible that I could be redeemed?

I think this song ties together with another great line from this album: ""I went to bed last night and my moral code got jammed/I woke up this morning with a frappacino in my hand"".  There's a theme of obsession with success clouding our vision of what is really important

Absolutely unbelievable song.

I agree with the opinion that ""the cleaners"" are a personification of Time, but I think we can actually combine a few of the ideas already brought forth. The narrator is speaking to his child in regret for how he has led him/her astray from Christ, and how he and his friends have become exceedingly arrogant and materialistic through their lives to the point where they have lost sight of the true spiritual treasure they had known. A sudden realization of this fact as they approach death sends the narrator into an apologetic tailspin as he is separated from his child as he is carted toward heaven after his repentance. 

And I have to say, the fact that a train was used as a metaphor for the transportation into the afterlife fit VERY WELL into the Harry Potter story, and I'm glad they used it in the film; Harry is told by Dumbledore that all he would need to do to move on is board a train, which would take him into the next life. It's actually much more significant to me now than when I actually saw the film.

@jerbaz 















I'll try and make it a bit clearer what I think it's about, cause I might be wrong, but it seems to fit. 

Nick's putting himself in the position of someone older, nearing death. He and the others have done things in this world (""Gulags""), which although left them richer (""Lost amongst our winnings"") are morally a bit wrong and left the world a bit rubbish. The gun reference could be an allusion to regret, which the song seems to be full of...

I think part of it is the realisation that even if they wanted to make everything right they couldn't. People will be people, and people replace other people and become in the same position and it doesn't matter how much they try to convince the young that they need to look at everything, they never will. 

The other feeling I get from the lyrics is the realisation that Death is quite near and it's something to fear whatever age you are, so maybe people should live their lives to the fullest.

This is among the most sophisticated songs ever written; it is true literature.  

The verses alternate between a young person with a broken heart and old folks who are passing away.  What links them together is Time, in this song represented by ""the cleaners"".  

Time heals all wounds, including the young person's broken heart.  But there's a paradox because the passage of time is also leading us inexorably toward death.  

The cleaners will clean our broken little hearts but they will also, eventually, clean every last trace of us off the Earth.

What is the solution to this paradox (the ""answer to all our fears"")?  

For a Christian like Nick Cave, the solution is to embrace Christ, so that Time ceases to be a set of cleaners wiping us from history, and becomes a train carrying us in the direction of the Kingdom which we will reach at death. 

We lost this answer in our pursuit of winnings (earthly possessions); the desire for earthly possessions is a trap (""a gulag"") which keeps us from discovering the way out.

Jim rediscovered the answer (the Kingdom) at death, and then the narrator has a conversion experience (much like Nick Cave).  He ""once was blind"" but now can see, he was ""held in chains"" (in the gulag) but now is free.

As soon as he has this conversion experience, his experience of time changes from dread (fear of getting old) to anticipation (of meeting God at death). Instantaneously  he is free of the gulag and celebrates, even before the train of his new life starts moving.  Merely being pointed in the right direction (being born again) is a basis for happiness.

You might expect that having been freed of his chains and having gotten on the train, the narrator would now ""lift up his voice"" and ""rejoice"".  But here is where the song, to me, becomes literature.  If you'll note, the rejoicing comes before he gets on the train.  That is, I think, because the song is actually the means by which he will be saved.  Lifting up his voice to God in song (accepting Christ) is the act that converts his heart to God, puts him on the train and keeps him heading toward the Kingdom.  You might even say that rejoicing (ie exclaiming Christ as one's saviour) is the train itself.

The lesson of the song is that instead of singing our woes (our broken little hearts, poor old Jim, the light is dim) we should change our tune so to speak and lift up our voices in song to God.

It is a song, therefore, about song.

I think everyone is over thinking the meaning to this song. School massacre, suicide and my favorite.. CONCENTRATION CAMPS?? I think not.

To me it's about a person who lost faith in God. They get drug down by the world and lose faith getting cought up in the hype and excitement of the world

""Forgive us now for what we've done
It started out as a bit of fun""

As they near death unhappy they find what they needed all along, something that was right there in front of them but obscured by the temptations of the world 

""We have the answer to all your fears
It's short, it's simple, it's crystal clear
It's round about, it's somewhere here
Lost amongst our winnings""

After this they find peace and live happy, waiting for the train(death) to take them to the kingdom(heaven).

First I would like to say I love this song and it made HP7 that much better
Secondly, anyone can pick any song apart so far it looses its meaning, JUST LISTEN and don't over think it

Once I look at it closely... it seems like a song about children in camps (concentration camps that is). I looked up gulag and that's what it means, the USSR's concentration camps.

""The cleaners have done their job on you
They're hip to it, man, they're in the groove
They've hosed you down, you're good as new
And they're lining up to inspect you""

I don't know about Soviet Russia, but in Germany and other Nazi camps, children were used for experiments, they cleaned them and then ""inspected them"".

Prisoners were sent in trains, and during this period of time children weren't told what was really going on... 

Everyone has their own interpretation though

"
824,Ode to Sleep.json,"
OK, so I heard Tyler say in an interview that this song IS Twenty One Pilots. That it summarizes who they are. I thought… hmm… really? And after looking at they lyrics, I'm going to take a guess at why he said that...

As anyone who knows their lyrics has figured out, Tyler has been tormented by negative thoughts and even thoughts of suicide. In Christian imagery, and several of their songs, these ""evil thoughts"" are represented by demons (whether you believe them to be true demons or just psychological attacks from a darkness within). And in Christian belief, demons attack those that they see as a threat. 

This song is basically saying - hey, maybe Tyler is being attacked because he is a threat - because he has the capacity/means to be an instrument of good (through his pen / the band's music). There's a purpose for him on this earth. 

And in the song, he's crying out to a higher power (God) saying, ""Aaaah!! Why? I don't want this on my shoulders! I don't want this purpose! I don't want this pen! Tell the demons you have no plans for me! I don't want to do this! This isn't the freedom you promised!""

And in the end, he tells God that he's ""sorry."" He realizes the plans that God has for him, to be a mouthpiece of hope - to encourage young people to think, and to survive, and to live. And that's why this song is so important to Twenty One Pilots.

(And as others have said, the three denials (echoing the story of Peter) and the fourth denial about ""not telling"" whom he's singing toward (God/higher power) is something with which he struggles. He doesn't want to sing and write songs and perform for money and fame (""whore"") - he wants to fulfill his purpose.)

That's my interpretation. Not sure I got it right, but if I'm even close (and I think I am), then it's just another reason to love this band.

""Ode to Sleep"" is one of my favorite songs lyrically from twenty one pilots (who happens to be my favorite band of the last decade) and admittedly one of the most difficult to interpret. The song is deeper that what most believe. I think the following is pretty close, but I'm sure I may have missed some nuances or gotten it wrong in some places.

The lyrical genius of Tyler Joseph portrays a torrid struggle between voices of darkness and the songwriter's struggle to overcome the darkness. The song is girded in spirituality and the voices that are attempting to overcome his mind are in fact demons or even Satan. The song also happens to be all over the map musically, which I feel adds to this struggle and to the song's uniqueness.

""I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start
Planning my crash landing
I go up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding""

He starts his days well, but inevitably as his day progresses he begins on a self-destructive path toward hopelessness, giving up, and perhaps taking his life.  Later lyrics seem to indicated he may also be struggling with guilt over his hypocritical thoughts and actions that betray his faith and beliefs [in God and Christ] but more on this later. However, just as he's ""planning [his] crash landing"" - taking himself out - he is brought ""up to the ceiling"" and ""feels his soul start leaving"" as God brings him back into a healthier state of mind. I'll admit I am somewhat unsure of the meaning of this verse, but I think my interpretation fits well with the struggle portrayed by the rest of the song. 

""I'm pleading, ""Please, oh please!""
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this
Is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one
To have the sons blood on my hands""

During this time with God as he reflects on his failure to live the way he wants to - the way God desires that he live - he pleads with God asking why he has to continue to struggle in his fight against hopelessness and sin and the forces that continue to seem to ensnare him and tell him to give up. ""Is this living free?"" Obviously not. Additionally, the songwriter does not want to be a hypocrite by continuing to sin and nail holes into the wrists of his Savior (""I don't wanna be the one to have the son's blood on my hands"") and the son he is referring to is Christ, the son of God. Christ shed his blood to atone for the sins of man (or for those who believe depending on your theology). The songwriter is in turmoil because he knows he is hurting the his Savior and not living in the freedom that is meant for him.

At this point, I believe the songwriter begins to transition into a new, more hopeful thought process. My favorite lyric in this song is ""I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight."" This phrase could have one of several meanings: he will choose to physically stay alive and not allow the enemy to take his life; he will choose to stay spiritually awake and vigilant in his struggle against what the evil voices are telling him to do, and thus not be taken prisoner; or perhaps he's simply referring to staying awake.

""Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out
I must have kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone
They told me I was gone""

At some point during the night, after his decision to ""stay awake,"" the songwriter  seems to have squelched the voices of the demons that were speaking ""crazy words"" into his brain, telling him he ""was gone"" - that it was hopeless, he was done for, and that he might as well give up (and perhaps take his life).

""But I'll tell 'em
Why won't you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant""

He inquires of the demons why they continue to torment him, as he sees himself as ultimately insignificant in the kingdom of God and that his life will not threaten the plans of the enemy (to lead people away from God). Why does he not see himself as a threat? Because following, during the bridge, he clearly states that his witness for God and Christ is nonexistent because he is afraid to tell others who he adores.

""I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four""

This passage is clearly a reference to the three time denial of Christ by Peter in the New Testament of the Bible. The songwriter has denied Christ because, as I said before, he is afraid to tell others who he adores and who he's singing towards. The bridge also has some other great lines in it. ""The start of a day when we put on our face a mask that portrays that we don't need grace"" alludes our bad habit of pretending we're without fault (sin) and we don't need the undeserved favor of God. ""On the eve of a day that is bigger than us"" I believe means that our lives are not about us, but instead about how God uses us in His grand story. ""And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead desperately yelling, ""There's something we need!"" - Creation pleads with us that we need help - that we need a Savior from ourselves and from the lying voices of the enemy that tell us to give up. 

""Please tell 'em
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?""

At this point, he even asks of God to tell Satan or the demons that he has no significance and that God has no plans for him in God's kingdom. This is clearly part of the demon's lies that the songwriter has been believing about himself. This is the turmoil. This is the struggle. I believe the lyrics ""I will set my soul on fire"" means he is so deep in despair that he desires to destroy his soul. In his hypocrisy and denials of God he asks ""what have I become?""

""I'm sorry""

It's pretty clear here, if you buy into my interpretation of this song, the songwriter is apologizing to God.

Part of the beauty and genius of Tyler's lyrics is that although they have a deep spiritual meaning (in this case Christian), they can also be interpreted in many different ways, making his heartfelt and honest lyrics that deal with real problems accessible to so many.

I've always felt like this song represents Tyler's mind at war (referenced in 'Migraine'). His mind is always tripping over itself, he is always thinking deeply, whether good or bad. He is a slave to himself, trapped by his inability to be mentally calm. And when once in a while when he is free, and when his mind has calmed he is lost and doesnt know what to do, ""Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out""
This is my person interpretation, probably cause i feel the same as this, maybe its just a personal connection, but everyone interprets the lyrics different.

This song seems to be the basic cry of an insomniac. It beautifully portrays the intense struggle one finds himself in once he lies down for sleep. You start to think about everything that has gone wrong, but most of all the wrongs you caused. Mind racing and ""demons yelling"", one also finds himself in the perfect position to write, as there is rarely another time when an insomniac's mind will bring forth as much information as when said person is attempting to sleep. However, once the writing begins, it is hard to stop in time to get the amount of sleep you were aiming for, therefore placing anxiety on the fulfillment of priorities, such as work. It is at this moment that the decision is made to stay awake. The ""dark"" can't take prisoners that don't sleep.

This song is about a mans struggles as a follower of God to trust in his forgiveness.

""I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four""

This line he is saying that he is afraid to tell people that he believes in God, and that his lyrics are directed towards Him. By whore it is ment currupt and he is currupt and a hyporcrite by not singing what he believes. Which makes denial number for, anothe denail as related to the 3 denials of Peter in the bible.

@maggie321011 















I think in order to truly understand Ode to Sleep, you need to look not just at the lyrics, but the song itself. The title ""Ode to Sleep"" may represent how Tyler's mind is not at rest. The melody frequently changes throughout the song, and that may represent how rapidly Tyler thinks and how many thoughts he can have in his mind because he is such a deep and thoughtful person. 
I wake up fine and dandy
But by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start 
Planning my crash landing 
I go up to the ceiling
And I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old mans hair receding
I think this stanza could be interpreted in a few different ways. One way is that he wakes up fine, but then the ""demons"" get to him and he begins to feel suicidal (hence: ripping his heart apart and planning his crash landing) but then God saves him from the demons. However, I think ripping his heart apart and planning his crash landing could also mean simply writing a song. I know it may sound odd but hear me out on this. ""Ripping his heart apart"" may mean exposing his heart and showing it in songs he writes, and planning his crash landing may be the effects of spending too much time thinking negatively, (letting the demons in). When he talks about going up to the ceiling and feeling his soul leaving, that may refer to writer's block because so much of his music expresses how he feels agonized by the demons in his mind and if he does not feel agonized, he can't really write about it, and feeling his soul leaving may be about how he fears he may lose his depth and ability to write so deeply. This song, in a way, is an internal fight inside of Tyler's mind about how he feels he must choose between happiness and fulfillment (his ability to write music the way he does). 
I'm pleading ""Please, oh, please.""
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this
Is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one
To have the sons blood on my hands
I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon, forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon
In addition to being an internal fight, this song is also, in my opinion, a prayer. He is telling God that he does not think he is cut out for the plans God has for him to write music about the darkness in people's lives and attempt to bring them out of it, and that he doesn't want to have so much of God's faith, because that makes him a target to the demons, who in Christian faith attack anyone they find threatening to them (represented by his agonizing thoughts). It is also a contradiction to what he said at first about how he feels his soul leaving. 
I'll stay awake 
Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight 
Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out
Another contradiction. Now he feels happy and free again.
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone 
Now, looking back, fear may be beginning to creep back into his mind again. Another contradiction.
I tell 'em 
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Now, he feels that he would rather truly be insignificant than have to suffer through being tortured by the demons. He tries to tell the demons that he is not a threat to them so that they might leave him alone. 
Please tell them 
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell 'em
At the beginning of this stanza, Tyler is talking to God, begging Him to tell the demons to leave him alone by saying he is not a threat. At this point of the song, Tyler is saying that he would be willing to destroy his soul (the part of him that allows him to make the music he does) just so the demons will leave him alone. The last two lines are him talking to himself. He asks himself what he has become, what the demons and songwriting have caused him to become. When he says ""I'll tell 'em"", he's become impatient with God, so he wants to take matters into his own hands.
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face,
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace,
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us,
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must,
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead,
Desperately yelling there's something we need,
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times,
Same amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime,
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards,
Metaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four.
The ""day"" may be referring to Good Friday (the day in Christian faith where Jesus died on the cross for everyone's sin) because he is talking about how the ""masks"" we're an attempt to hide the fact that Christian people felt lost without Jesus, and nature is begging for Him back. I think he felt it necessary to add this to the song because that may be how he currently felt, lost and alone and he felt that God was not by his side. Then, he begins talking about his own faith, and how he asked for forgiveness three times but also denied his faith three times, that may be an explanation for why he feels he is not as powerful against the demons as he could be. However, he also says he does not want to recognize God as the person he is singing about in his songs. I think when he says he's a whore, he means that he is not willing to show his faith, because a whore can mean someone who does not show loyalty or faith to anyone in particular, and because he calls that another denial of his faith. 
What have I become?
I'm sorry.
At the end of the song, Tyler figures that he may also be to blame for what he feels, and his apology may be to himself, to God, or to anyone he knows. He is sorry because he let the demons change him so much that he may have lost sight of who he was before.
Ode to Sleep is personally one of my favorite songs by Twenty Øne Piløts because of how clever it is all around.

One has to be pretty knowledgeable about Tyler Joseph to get this song in general. So let’s lay this out. Tyler has struggled with plenty of negative thoughts, and even suicidal feelings, and parts of this song reflect that. Tyler (and Josh) both are Christians, and this song has heavy religious undertones, if you’re looking for them.
“I wake up fine and dandy” refers to waking up in the morning and feeling great. Everyone knows how it is, after you get past the morning tiredness, you’re usually pretty energetic, right? Most are, anyway. “By the time I find it handy/ to rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing” refers to the depression and suicidal thoughts setting in. “I go up up up up up to the ceiling, then I feel my soul start leaving/like an old man’s hair receding” is referring to the singer (Tyler) being lifted up, motivated, cheered up, whatever you want to call it, by God.
I’m pleading “please, oh please” on my knees repeatedly
Asking why it’s got to be like this, is this living free?
I don’t wanna be the one, be the one who has the sun’s blood on my hands,
I’ll tell the moon, “Take this weapon forged in darkness;
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon.”
The first two lines there, indicate Tyler’s struggles as a song writer. He’s crying out to God, pleading to have the struggles and constricting force of his sins and wrong-doings as well as other burdens lifted from him. “Is this living free?” No. The next three lines were a hard one, but here are my thoughts.
TOP is pretty well known for their metaphors; almost nothing is exactly what it looks like. My thought is perhaps, “sun” has two meanings here. The sun is a light, yes? Jesus is the light of the world, but he is also the son of God. Tyler doesn’t want Christ’s blood on his hands, but he is struggling with internal battles because he is a sinful being, as we all are, and he knows that he is not perfect, and his bad choices hurt Christ.
I’m kind of unsure on what the moon has to do with it, but my best thought is that when he says he’ll tell the moon to take the weapon forged in darkness, it’s like he’s trying to pass the deed off on someone else. “Here; you take it, you do it. I don’t want the blood on my hands.” The moon could also be referring to a darker being. Perhaps one of the demons he mentions later on?
We know the saying, “The pen is mightier than the sword.” Well, here, a pen is being compared to a harpoon. Tyler is acknowledging the power that words can have, for better or for worse. A harpoon is capable of doing a lot of damage; a pen holds that same deadly power. But, with his words, Tyler also knows he can spread hope. And the next part of the song takes on a happier, more hopeful feel.
I’ll stay awake; cuz the dark’s not takin’ prisoners tonight.
This line could have several meanings. But for my purposes, I have chosen one; He’s going to stay physically awake, to avoid torment in his dreams, when his mind is vulnerable. He’s not going to be overwhelmed by the negativity that his sleep brings.
Why am I not scared in the morning? I can’t hear those voices calling.
I must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out.
I swear I hear demons yelling, those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.
Tyler’s gaining confidence. He no longer hears the voices in his head; he must have kicked them out. Pretty literal. He’s gotten rid of them. “I swear I heard demons yelling, those crazy words they were spelling/ they told me I was gone they told me I was gone” is referring to the negativity; it is being personified as demons. Demons also tend to target threats. This point discussed next.
But I’ll tell ‘em
“Why won’t you let me go? Do I threaten all your plans?
I’m insignificant.”
Please tell ‘em
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become?
I’ll tell ‘em
So the demons seem to think Tyler is a threat. He’s trying to tell them he’s insignificant, and asking God to tell them that he’s not a threat, because he just wants them to leave him alone. He’s tired of being tormented. Or, he’s beginning to believe the demons lies that he’s really not anything. “I will set my soul on fire” suggests that he feels so far gone that he feels his soul must be destroyed(?), and then he asks himself “What have I become?” Seemingly looking with disbelief and hopelessness at what he’s saying/doing. He can’t believe what he’s becoming.
On the eve of a day that’s forgotten and fake
And the trees they await and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don’t need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes cuz we’re told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling there’s something we need.
I’m not free. I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied
I three-time MVP’ed this crime
I’m afraid to tell you who I adore, won’t tell you who I’m singing towards
Metaphorically, I’m a whore and that’s denial number four.
Ok. So big chunk of song here, let’s break it down. And I don’t mean try to rap it.
A day that’s forgotten and fake, through desperately yelling there’s something we need. This suggests a day, perhaps in history, that has been forgotten. Or could be. Looking at earlier parts of the song(specifically “The sun’s blood), it could be suggested that the “forgotten day” is Good Friday, the day of the Crucifixion, or Easter, the day of the Resurrection. A mask that portrays that we don’t need grace indicates a façade that Christians will sometimes present to “fit in” with society’s norms and practices.  We don’t need this, we’re good enough on our own. But human nature contradicts this, “desperately yelling there’s something we need.” And we “await” and “anticipate” that something(?)
The next chunk of the verse. Tyler is acknowledging that he isn’t free. He is imprisoned by his wrongs, and by the darkness in his life. “I asked forgiveness three times/ same amount that I denied” refers quite bluntly to Peter’s denial of Christ in the New Testament. Jesus tells Peter that before the rooster crows, he(Peter) will deny him(Jesus) three times. Peter says “no, I will never deny you.” But yet, when a servant girl asks if he’s one of Jesus’s disciples, He says “I am not.” He does this twice more, even getting angry and cursing at those who swear up and down that they’ve seen him with Jesus. Immediately after the third denial, the rooster crows. “Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: ""Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."" And he went outside and wept bitterly.” The song seems to suggest that Tyler asks forgiveness after each denial. He’s the “MVP” in his crime of denying his faith.
He states that he’s “afraid to tell you who I adore, won’t tell you who I’m singing towards”, meaning that he’s denying his faith again, by neglecting to tell you who he’s calling out to: God. The word “whore” is defined as prostitute, which we know to mean someone who sells their body for sex, or one who is not faithful/loyal, in this respect. When Tyler says that he is metaphorically a whore, he’s conceding to the fact that he’s not being faithful/loyal to his God. And he admits to it being “denial number four,” adding to the first three that he mentioned.
The end of the song, where Tyler concludes with “I’m sorry”, is him apologising to God for his denial, and for his sin, and for everything else that he feels he is at fault for.
As a whole, this song digs into Tyler’s struggle as a Christian writer, who wants to share his beliefs without sharing them, and the torment he faces about his life, and his choices.
At least, that’s my view on it. -StressedOutLaneBoyWithAMigraine

My breakdown on the song

""I wake up fine and dandy but then by the time I find it handy,
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing,"" 

-he wakes up fine, but through the day, beats himself up so much, he's planning for how bad/guilty he'll feel later over his sin

""I'm pleading please, oh please on my knees repeatedly asking,
why it's got to be like this. Is this living free?""

-he's pleading with God because he feels so guilty over his sin and beats himself up so much over it, he doesn't feel like he's living free as God said he would. Reference Bible verse ""whom the son sets free is free indeed""

""I don't want to be the one, be the one who has the sun's blood on my hands,
I'll tell the moon, take this weapon forged in darkness,
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon.""

-sun's blood on his hands, really ""Son's blood"". he feels guilty because he (as we all are) is responsible for the death of Jesus as he died for our sins - he bled for us. That's what he means - he doesn't want to have Jesus's blood on his hands, the guilt of that. Take the weapon forged in darkness is how he uses his lyrics to write his dark feelings through his ""pen"" or harpoon.

""I'll stay awake,
Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight.""

-possibly a reference to he is staying awake because he's too scared to sleep in a sense. Saying dark's not taking prisoners, Hell is the dark,  prisoner is him. ""Dark's not taking prisoners tonight - he's staying awake, he's staying awake so the dark can't take him.

""Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling,
I must have kicked them out""

-he feels he's recovered in the morning, he doesn't hear the voices calling him, telling him he's lost and not saved, he feels secure. ""he must've kicked them out"". 

I swear I heard demons yelling,
Those crazy words they were spelling,
They told me I was gone, they told me I was gone.

-the demons were telling him he's lost, he's gone, a goner. ""I'm a goner...somebody catch my breath"" ;). I guess the demons were lying to him when he wrote Goner too. 

""But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant""

-he's telling the demons, please leave me be in peace, i'm not going to getting in your way or ""threaten all your plans, I'm insignificant"". He's not important to God's plan (in his own mind). 

""Please tell them you have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them""

-telling God, please tell the demons you don't have any plans for me, you're not going to use me as a key for the kingdom. ""I will set my soul on fire"" - saying I don't need the demons to set my soul on fire, I mess up so much,  I'll do it myself. I'll destroy myself, I don't need the demons help to do it.Then he reflects by saying ""what have I become?""

""On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake,
And the trees they await and clouds anticipate""

-eve of day forgotten and fake - not sure, maybe he is dissing God, saying the day of Jesus Christ's return is forgotten - and disses by calling it fake as well. The trees and clouds anticipate because even all of the earth obeys Gods so they wait on him. As a preacher once said ""God tells sun to rise, it rises, ocean waves to come this far and they go no further and they obey, God says to man, come to me and man says no!""

""The start of a day when we put on our face,
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace""

-saying that we get up and pretend everything is okay - put on our masks acting as if we don't need God's grace when we're really broken and in need of grace and mercy

""On the eve of a day that is bigger than us,
But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must,""

-the day of Christ's return, a day that is bigger than us, we open our eyes to the truth

""And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead,
Desperately yelling there's something we need,""

-Trees and clouds obey God remember, so they are pleading with us as they probably have more truth than we do. lol. Desperately yelling there's something we need - that something is salvation, as we are lost sinners before we come to Christ.

""I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times,
Same amount that I denied, I three-time mvp'ed this crime,""

-yet Tyler is saying he is not free. Maybe Tyler is not saved, but a lost sinner. Bible says ""whoever Son sets free is free indeed"", yet Tyler says he is not. He says he's asked forgiveness three times, but apparently doesn't feel saved. ""Same amound that I denied"" - reference to Peter denying Jesus, he says he does the same thing and as a matter of fact, he is an MVP at doing it (self deprecating).

""I'm afraid to tell you who I adore, won't tell you who I'm singing towards,
Metaphorically I'm a whore, and that's denial number four.""

-he doesn't want to straight out tell us He adores God, which is sad since he calls himself a Christian. Sad for me too as I'm guilty of the same. He won't say who he's singing towards lol. Come on Tyler, it's obvious it's God. He just denied Jesus again by not saying who he's singing towards.

That's my take, hopefully Tyler is a saved Christian and me as well. I encourage you all to seek God and get in His word. Let's believe what God said is true, ""while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us"" and ""whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life""

@danbg my sister actually got the same idea about “On the eve of the day that’s forgotten and fake” and “On the eve of the day that is bigger than us” being about Christ’s Return aka Judgement Day. But he’s not calling it fake. He’s saying others believe it’s fake, and a lot of self-proclaimed Christians (ones who only want to believe what they want about the Bible and ignore the rest) have forgotten and/or don’t believe it will happen.

""Light of my life, fire of my loins,"" are the opening words to 'Lolita,' if you've read it you'll realise that the song is pretty much like a soundtrack to the book. The book is a classic and LDR has put a nice 'gangsta' spin on it. My favourite song of hers by far...

Another classic Lana love song, even more perverse than her other songs. She wants to be loved the possessive way Humbert Humbert loves Lolita, a twisted love of ownership and worship, where Lover Sugar Daddy owns her like a possession and worships her sexually. As per usual with Lana, the spending of money on her equates to love, because Lana likes the masochistic delight of being owned and bought by another person. Giving herself up to be owned by another is the declaration of the greatest possible love for Lana.

			I was about to comment that harlot was spelled wrong, too!! :D			

This song is obviously about the classic ""Lolita"", by Vladimir Nabokov as the opening line to the book is ""Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul."" Lana has described her style as ""Lolita got lost in The Hood,"" meaning that she has probably read the book, and based ""Off To The Races"" on it. I believe she uses the book as an overall metaphor for her own life, or it could just possible weave between the two. I think that when she sings 'And I'm off to the races, cases
of Bacardi chasers, chasin' me all over town', she is using it as a metaphor. When Lana was younger she had problems with alchohol and I think she is saying that the thought of a drink follows her around, like Humbert did Lolita.

			Also in one of her songs, she mentions heart shaped glasses which is a theme in the movie, and even in the Lolita movie poster. nachtkabarett.com/ihvh/img/… 

This whole song is about the book and film Lana Del Rey claims she loves: Lolita. 
If you watch the film it will all make sense and it's a pet peeve of mine people that claim they love this song without having any idea what its about and just thinking it's another love story. It's more than that as in this song Lana sings as if she is Lolita even from her voice which she makes very child like throughout, even the words are sung from the perspective of a child such as the bit where she almost breaks down about her feelings and sings 

""My old man is a thief, and
I'm gonna stay and pray with him till the end
 But I trust in the decision of the LORD,
To watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way
I need you, I breathe you, I'D never leave you
They would rue the day, I was alone without you

You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said hon' you never looked so beautiful
As you do now my man

This bit is very childlike as if she is throwing down all her feelings like she's probbably heard about in the movies and its all very desperate like you get over your first love and you think it will never end. It also highlights how much older Lolita (Lana Del Rey) thinks she is by saying all this.

Absolutely love.

I think the speaker in this song is Carmen, from that later track on her album. The songs might just have similar themes but be completely different, but my interpretation is that both Carmen and the speaker in this song are prostitutes. I think ""Carmen"" is about the difficulties of a life of prostitution from an outsider's perspective, but ""Off to the Races"" is Carmen's defense for her lifestyle...she believes (or just tells herself) that she's really living the good life and that her pimp legitimately cares about her and takes care of her.

Just a thought :) I had been wondering about this when I heard some similarities in the two songs, ex: ""slipping on my red dress, putting on my makeup"" from this song and ""put your red dress on, put your lipstick on"" from ""Carmen.""

Your twisted mind is like snow on the road - her thoughts are dangerous, possibly life threatening
Your shaking shoulders prove that it's colder/Inside your head/In the winter of dead - these say that she (possibly she is crying) thinks cold thoughts, or dark thoughts

Wow! And the light bulb shines! Thanks to my fellow commenters, I now have a better meaning to this song. (Misbeliever) gives the song so much more meaning, than what I thought. I never made the connection, but the rest of the lyrics fit perfectly. 

""Oh, Miss Believer, my pretty sleeper
 Your twisted mind is like snow on the road
 Your shaking shoulders prove that it's colder
 Inside your head
 In the winter of dead""

-This is the picture of the unbeliever. Asleep, twisted thoughts and beliefs, without understanding, fear, cold (heart), death.

(I will tell you I love you
 But the muffs on your ears will cater your fears
 My nose and feet are running as we start
 To travel through snow
 Together we go)

-God, by his Holy spirit gives us opportunities galore to accept his love. To believe in his truth, but we are distracted by everything, like our car radios (down with them all!!!) :) We ignore his promptings to follow him because we would rather do things our way. We are selfish and sinful, but he offers life, for the wages of sin are death. Traveling through snow is hard, as is the journey of a believer, but the life of an unbeliever is no life at all.

Anywayzzzzzz...  Yesterday this song was just a pretty sounding one about some chick. And today it is new to me. The same, but better all around. I hope ""Ruby"" is metaphorical and will change too.

I see this song as coping with uncertainty (in Tyler's case possibly religion) and misbelief. Sorting through doubt and questions with no answers is a slow and arduous process, and can feel like walking through thick snow. As you get older these fears and uncertainties don't go away, but rather increase in number. Hence, as we grow older, we get colder.

@thisistooshort 















it think God is talking to MIS-believer as she doesn't believes in him and he is trying to call her back to him.

""I will tell you i love you but the muffs on your ears would cater your fears""
these lines perfectly explain my theory as God is telling her that he loves her but her 'muffs' which can represent the world or her sins are stopping him to do so and her fears are preventing her from coming back to God as well.

""Please,take my hand,we're in foreign land/As we travel through snow/Together we go""
this is also God requesting her to come with him.And as she is a misbeliever,it would be hard for her to come back to her religion which is why it says ""As we travel through snow"" as walking in snow is pretty difficult.

also it says ""pretty sleeper"" and ""pretty weeper"" just to represent God's love and how God loves however his creation is.

Lastly the twisted thoughts the person is getting can be blasphemy and doubt in God -the continuation of the comment made by me

I discovered Twenty One Pilots while streaming music and started listening to all their albums. Usually during work, so I never actually learned song titles right away.

Not saying it can't be about a girl, BUT...from what I've read, apparently the first song he wrote about a girl is ""Tear In My Heart"", soooo...

@PorchFrank 















To me, this song is pretty simple. The lyrics tell the story of an elderly couple from the point of view of the husband. This couple has been together for many years, thru thick and thin. Think of your elderly grandparents, who are nearly incapable of self care. Thru the lyrics, it is apparent that the wife suffers from either dementia and/or alzheimer's. The snow and cold in this story is actually age, and its affect on our bodies...slowing us down as the years pile on. She is called both Misbeliever and Miss Believer, which describes her perfectly as she often forgets who her husband is (and sometimes remembers) as anyone who has ever had a loved one with alzheimer's would know the emotional pain involved. The words ""Inside her head, in the winter of dead"" only lead credibility to the fact that age (winter) has taken her mind (memory).

The song ends with this:
We get colder
As we grow older
We will walk
So much slower

Meaning he will remain by her side, until age takes them both......

I like to think this song is a love song about a girl who believes in something, whether it is an aspiration to become or a fantasy world. Her thoughts are unique and dark, but beautiful in her own way. He sings about how much he loves her for the way she thinks rather than her appearance. He loves her unconditionally for who she is.

									Yes he is talking about a real dog. In short, this is what the song means:
He caught his wife cheating on him, so he killed the guy she was having an affair with. He got thrown in jail for 99 years. He got a grand plan to escape, but first he needed to become the guardian of the prisons' tracking dog, a Bloodhound named Ol' Red. He finally did 2 years later. Then he asked his cousin to bring down a female Blue Tick Hound. They penned her up, and when the guy took Red for a run every night, he brought him to the Tick hound. The two dogs fell in love, and so Red ""got used to seeing his lady every night."" So he kept Red away from the Tick Hound for a few days, then made his run. When the prison guards sent Ol' Red out to find the runaway, he went to see his girl instead because he hadn't seen her in a few days. Thus the guy got away, when no one else had ever gotten past Red. In the end where is says 'Now there's red-haired blue ticks all in the south, love got me in here, and love got me out' he means that Red and the Tick hound had puppies, and since his love for his wife got him thrown in jail, and the dogs' love got him out- so yeah. 
There you have it.

In the end where is says 'Now there's red-haired blue ticks all in the south, love got me in here, and love got me out' he means that Red and the Tick hound had puppies, and since his love for his wife got him thrown in jail, and the dogs' love got him out- so yeah. 
There you have it.										

I always think of Shawkshank Redemption during this song.

""Well I caught my wife with another man And it cost me ninety nine"" he's saying he got the man that was with his wife and now for that he's in prison for 99 years. (murdered him). ""a blue tick hound, She was pretty as she could be, Well they penned her up in the swampland, 'Bout a mile just south of the gate, And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run, I'd just drop him off and wait"" he took the dog to see the other dog and just let Red do his thing. Now Ol' Red got real used to seeing His lady every night, And so I kept him away for three or four days,And waited till the time got right"" Rdd was used to seeing the other dog so he kept him away for a few days so that when he was out for his run, he would go to the female instead of follow blake. ""Love got me in here and love got me out"" Love got him in there because he killed the man that was with is wife... love got him out because Red fell in love with the blue tick.

This is a great poetic song about something that is a part of Kenny's life  - an old blue chair in the sand, somewhere in the carribbean (or wherever). This chair is like his second home...everyone has a place where they can go, a place of inspiration, a place to get drunk, or just be alone. For him, that chair is his place. It is where he sees the world in its greatest majesty. I also like nature/outdoors...and I find places to go wherever I am at the moment to be alone...but nothing cmpares to the way you see the world from your special place. For Kenny Chesney, it's that old blue chair in the sand, and that's good enough for him.

I believe he actually says ""Cruzan and diet"" not Malibu.  Not a big deal b/c it's still rum but I picked up on the Cruzan reference the first time I heard this song.  I know Cruzan started sponsoring his tour a year or so ago, and while it is a really good rum, I just thought it was a bit odd than he wouldn't just say ""rum and diet.""  I hope Kenny didn't sell out to them and now has to mention them in songs as part of a contract.

My bad, I didn't realize this song was originally on his previous cd and that originally it actually was ""Malibu and diet.""  Anyone else think is a bit odd?  Anyway, this does confirm my selling out to Cruzan theory, although I'm sure there's a good chance he actually drinks the stuff.

ShakerMaker....you are correct, he does say Cruzan and Diet but only in the Ocean version of the song.  Great song any way you look at it, I prefer the Ocean version, as close as a fan can get to the way he originally came up with the song.  I can vision him sitting in the chair and after tinkering with a few versions, says ""yo check this out."" ...now get us a couple of beers.

Those things may matter to some, but in reality, all that matters is the charity. It seems that Christmas is the only time of year that everyone gathers together for the goodness of mankind, and it's a shame that it doesn't last longer than just that wintery season.

Another amazing, sexy hit by Camila Cabello. Between the slow melody and Camila's sensual voice, this song was made to set the mood anytime. With the detailed lyrics about her hips as she dances, and the image of an aloof and unattainable woman, this song makes you want to move your hips in a not-so-PG way. I always enjoy a song about woman power, and let me tell you that Camila Cabello is feeling herself in this one. The only thing that could make this hit better? Quavo in the background saying ""Oh my god"" about Camila and her body, making you want to sing along. It seems like Camila is only capable of putting out super sexy music. And I'm okay with that.

Wow, how come this doesn't have any comments yet? Nevertheless, it's a really great song, one of my favourites at the moment. It has such a uplifting and feel-good tune, and the lyrics and the song never cease to make me happy.

I think the lyrics are pretty clear, I think it's about being happy and feeling great about and finally appreciating your life after feeling down for a life. I think it's kind of like you don't know what you have until you've lost it, so you might as well appreciate everything you have, and also that it sometimes can be hard to feel happy and appreciate life, but you got to work for it, and get up as he sings, and it will eventually be worth it, when you finally get that feeling of being on top of the world.

@gingertune A few thoughts: musician’s are told you need to pay your dues, which is probably originally a reference to being in a musician’s union and paying your dues. But it has come to mean studying the masters, and playing lots of gigs for little to no money because of the love of music. I think paying his dues to the dirt possibly means he’s honored and studied the ones who came before him, most of who might be dead and buried in the dirt by now. Spending so much time studying the greats, but at the end of the day, they’re dead and gone and it’s his turn now! 

Or maybe it means playing gig after gig for an audience who was not paying attention or just there to drink, in some ways already dead? 

Or maybe it’s a reference to the recording industry, they did what it takes to be a part of this exclusive club, payed the dues, even though it’s a dirty, dehumanizing industry. 

Or maybe they spent a lot of time playing outside, around the campfire, honing these songs and their musical craft. What do you think?

			Paying dues: paying to belong to an organization or club. Before he was on top of the world, he was wasting his time belonging to lowly (dirt) organizations, maybe instead of investing in his higher self, he was investing his time and money in hanging out with the wrong crowd, spending money at bars, one-night stands and all the rest.

In my opinion the song is actually about someone who finally found the love of his/her life. 

Of course, I'd agree with the more general interpretations of someone who found his/her purpose in life, as well, but given the first sentence in particular, I'd say that it refers more to love in particular. (""If you love somebody
Better tell them while they’re here ’cause"").

The singer explains that he finally found the love of his life and that he is more than happy, in other words ""on top of the world"". He has been waiting for that for ages and been through some pretty tough times without any perspective of finding someone. ""Paying my dues to the dirt"", meaning in this context that he was very low, very close to the ground, in a very bad state, at some point, but then he pulled himself together again (""it's a long way up when you hit the ground"", ""get up now"") and finally found someone whom he either already told already or still wants to tell.

This song is so cheerful and really reflects how I feel when I have (at least) a crush on someone! :-)

I love this song.  It is very inspirational in lyrics, melody and tone.

My interpretation of ""paying my dues to the dirt"" is organic.  This song is all about accomplishing something you have dreamed about since childhood.  Compared to a seed, which grows with soil, water, warmth and sun, when one's goals and desires are finally fulfilled, we can pay our dues to the ""dirt,"" or the circumstances, places, trials, challenges, etc. which were the soil that grew us to the point of accomplishment.

Heres my input on this

I think that this song is about the feeling that people get when they are at a high moment in life (not drugs), and they are extremely happy. 

'If you love somebody
Better tell them why they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you'

I think that this is saying that if you like someone, and you know that that is the right person that you want to be with, than go for it! This song is also explaining the pure joy and excitement of being accepted.

			This song is amazing, for me I dont see it as a breakup song but more as being strong as life can be pain when people has put you down if you're being bullied and you rise above the pain.

""But down the road the sun is shining
In every cloud there's a silver lining
Just keep holding on (just keep holding on)
And every heartache makes you stronger""

You got to believe in your soul and heart will become stronger.

""Alright let's go
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (ha)""

The song begins faily innocently. Beiber says over and over that there will be ""one less lonely girl"". This means he will date said girl, eliminating the aforementioned loneliness, correct? Yes, the opening is innocent... until... the little laugh. Have you fooled us, Mr. Bieber? What, pray tell, is so funny?

""How many I told you’s and start overs
And shoulders have you cried on before
How many promises be honest girl
How many tears you let hit the floor
How many bags you packed
Just to take ‘em back tell me that
How many either or's but no more
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be the one less lonely girl""

Here, Bieber has found the perfect victim. A heartbroken young girl (who evidently enjoys traveling, and will be further referred to as “Lonely Girl”) with nothing left to live for but her sweet, innocent Mr. Bieber. Her heartbreak leaves her an easy victim, highly susceptible to the charms of the prepubescent Casanova. 

""Ohh Oh Oh
Saw so many pretty faces before I saw you you
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)""

Aha! Here is where Bieber confesses his intentions. He doesn't wish to cure Lonely Girl of her loneliness, making her one less lonely girl; rather, he intends to do away with Lonely Girl altogether! He sees ""only her"", a line frequently used to describer the stalker to stalkee realtionship. He finishes the chorus with ""I'm coming for you"", the first definitive evidence of his murderous tendencies. You know who else comes for you? Freddy Kruger *hums 'One, Two, Freddy's Coming For You'*. When Freddy comes for you, he wants to kill you. Young Justin's coming for you is of no important difference.

“Noo No
Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you’re mine in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you) One less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you) One less lonely girl
(I'm coming for you)One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth (That's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There’s gonna be one less lonely girl”

And here, we glimpse Bieber's twisted, disturbed mind. He assures us that he is most definitely coming for Lonely Girl, and that when all is said and done, there will be 'one less lonely girl'. The possibility of a planned murder is reinforced by the next lines: he plans to show Lonely Girl what she's worth (i.e. nothing) by murdering her. With this in mind, his request for entrance into Lonely Girl's world seems more like a threat than an offer to love her forever.

Following this is mainly Justin's unstable ramblings about his obsession with Lonely Girl and his intentions to kill her. From this point, I will highlight only the most important evidence.

“I just wanna set one girl free to fall,
Free to fall (she's free to fall)
Fall in love
With me
Her hearts locked and nowhere to get the key
I’ll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl”

And he confesses! He leaves Lonely Girl “free to fall” in love with him. Knowing he has managed to fool his prey, he swoops down for the kill! He “take[s] her”, and the world is left with “one less Lonely Girl”, finishing his sickening crime. 

Young Mr. Bieber is a menace to society. It is too late for us to save Lonely Girl, but the world is filled with girls just like her. If Bieber will not rest until he has “taken” each of them, we must not rest until this madchild is behind bars. And lonely girls, watch out: next time he could be coming for YOU.

			You are right about Bieber's intention but I don't know if you are right about ""One Less Lonely Girl"" being a reference to these under-age innocent fan girls or his victims.

If you don't have any background information about Lonely girl then you might not understand to why Justin Bieber used this term ""Lonely Girl"" in this song. Lonely Girl was a fake Youtube account that once existed on Youtube and she had many fans but one day, Youtube closed her account because the fact is that Lonely Girl never exist since it was a fake account. Someone was pretending to be her so she is a Virtual Girl and fake which later, upset many fans. Thus, ""Lonely Girl"" account was meant to fool the fan girls and fan boys into believing that she is real but the truth is she is very fake.

Maybe Justin was referring himself as the new lonely girl but this time, it is very less lonely girl since he is REAL and not fake and he is the BOY. The difference between Justin Bieber and the ""Lonely Girl"" is that he is a Real Person and his Youtube account would not be close but he is still like ""Lonely Girl"" because he does not care about his fans (especially the girls) but he pretended to care about them so this means that the girls were fooled by this new lonely girl just like the ""Lonely Girl"" had fooled many fan boys and some girls in the past. Maybe this is also why he did not call himself as a ""Lonely Boy"" because he wanted to use the meaning of the famous term ""Lonely Girl"" to remind people of the similarity between him and the ""Lonely Girl"" that had once existed on Youtube. One of his haters said that he should actually call this song as ""Lonely Boy"" instead.

This is why many people believe that Justin Bieber is gay and tried to hide his sexual orientation because otherwise he could lose his fans since most of them are bunch of homophobic girls.

Anyway, I am not against Justin Bieber since I am a boy and I wasn't his target and I think that he was doing what he suppose to do as a gay celebrity. This song actually reflects the fan girls who are irrelevant fanatics than it reflects Justin himself. Justin knows how irrelevant his fan girls are and he doesn't like liers because he wanted his fans to be more ""honest"" which most of them would eventually failed at the end. They also pretend to love him and in 1-2 years, they would forget about him. Many of his fans are retarded lunatics. Justin Bieber just wanted to have his private life back and he does not understand why his fans cried when they saw him because at the end of the day, they would hate him or forget about him when they found out that he is gay. He actually made fun of his irrelevant crazy fans before they make fun of him in the future which is funny and justifiable. I feel sorry for Justin Bieber since he is kinda repressed by the homophobic society. Many of his haters were actually his ex-homophobic-fans who claimed to love him at the beginning.

hate his voice he sounds like a girl. this song is ok... a lot better than ""one time.""  Im gonna point out the obvious and say that the only reason he's famous and gets his songs on the radio is because of his looks. then again, it seems like everything is about looks these days. oh and the lyrics above are a little wrong..just saying.

848,One Sweet Day.json,"
Recently a very close friend of the family died.  He was a great guy, like an uncle to me (in fact I used to call him Uncle Jack, even though his name was David).  I've him and his family longer than I've known my step-dad, they've always been there.  I was really close with them and their daughter and I used to be inseperable.  A few years ago we found out he had cancer, but he was his usual chipper self.  Never let anything hold him down.  Once I turned 16 he would tell me he was going to teach me how to drive once I got my permit.  At the end of December, '01 he got sick again, and was in the hospital.  I didn't think much of it, I guess I wasn't expecting anything to happen.  I mean, he was always there.  So New Years Eve, I went and to take my permit test, passed, and was all happy that I passed.   My parents told me that they were going to visit Uncle Jack in the hospital, but I didn't want to go.  Instead I wanted to stay and take a shower before I went to work.  The next day, they told me Uncle Jack died.  I was in such shock, it didn't really hit me at first.  Late that night I started to cry, a lot.  I thought about how I had the chance to visit him, had the chance to see him one last time.  I didn't even get to tell him about getting my permit or anything.  Then I went to the funeral and heard about all these things he did, military service, Boy Scouts, everything.  I saw his children - the people I grew up with - and how upset they were.  It was horrible.
This song fits everything perfectly.  ""Sorry I never told you/ All I wanted to say/ And now it's too late to hold you/ 'Cause you've flown away/ So far away/ Never had I imagined/ Living without your smile/ Feeling and knowing you hear me/ It keeps me alive/ Alive/ And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven/ Like so many friends we've lost along the way/ And I know eventually we'll be together/ One sweet day""
Definitely wish I could say something to him, any one last thing, even if it is about the stupid permit and driving.
*Sigh* Never take anyone for granted...

Everyone has a story to tell. Haha. I lost my mom in August this year..She passed away after struggling with cancer for 5 years. I don't exactly regret not telling her things, because I was there when she left and went to heaven (:

But I do miss having her around, and sometimes when I'm on the way back on the bus I wish she would be at home and I could greet her. But I know that she loves me and that one day, we'll get to see each other again and spend eternity together.

now, in these days do people really care what the lyrics are (they should) do you know how many times people reply to his youtube songs saying... he is so cute, hot, a good singer, I love him. It is good that you love him but do you love his songs, not the beat or the music videos, but the meaning of the song, if you understand the meaning of the song, not just one phase, but every world in the song then you should comment on how you love in the song he (as in Justin) is stating that he will put everything in his life to the side just for that special, number one girl!!! I am 13 and I never wrote something so touching like this before!!! :) I only went on this site to see if anyone knew what the meaning of shawty was, if it was like shorty ( as in he likes short girls), or this special girl.

I came on this site to find the meaning of the song.  All I received was a list of comments saying, ""I LOVE YOU JUSTINNNN!"" I do understand when you create a comment you have the option of Opinion, but seriously, this is a song meanings site.

What does this song mean?  Why is he only saying ""I love you"" one time?  Why can't he say it more than one time?  Is he embarrassed that she's his girl, so he'll only say he loves her once?  Does it just go along with the motif of ""one"" in the other lines in the song's chorus? I've read the versus and they just contain meaningless ""be my girl"" ""I like you"" ""people say we shouldn't be together"" nonsense.  It just doesn't make sense at all.  It a another silly love song that just contains blabber. 

I also find it funny that he'll only tell her once, but repeats that he'll tell her once many times. Ha, though he's probably saying that he'll tell her once in that time frame.

It's really about YOUNG love (like someone said before).  I like him and his voice, I think if his voice were any deeper, the song wouldn't have the same flavor.

this song might be sweet if it were sung by someone who meant it. i mean, ""Girl, i love you..."" seriously? you're 15. if it were by a 21 year old with a deeper voice who knows what love is, it might be better, except that if someone older sang it, he wouldn't have an excuse for the song to be a bit childish.
""and I'll be your one guy You'll be my number one girl"" i love this line, because it literally says I'll be your one guy, and you'll be my number one girl, as in I have others, but you'll be my number one. i think thats funny, but i know it doesn't really mean that.

Strange, Has no one noticed that lyrics are incorrect.
I found these lyrics, I hope it helps :)

I was once a man before I transformed
 into this molester, freshly deceased children
 You have born, torn by my rape
 The dead are not safe, the lifeless child corpse
 I will violate

 Pleasure from the dead, complete satisfaction
 I open the coffin
 Sick thoughts run through my head as I stare
 At the dead, over and over, I can't escape
 I begin the dead sex, licking her young, rotted orifice
 I cum in her cold cunt, shivering with ecstasy
 for nine days straight I do the same
 She becomes by dead, decayed child sex slave
 her neck I hack, cutting through the back
 I use her mouth to eject

 Here I cum, blood gushes from
 bleeding black blood
 her head disconnected
 As I came, viciously I cut, through her jugular vein
 She's already dead, I masturbate with her severed head
 My lubrication, her decomposition
 Spending my life molesting dead children

 Intercourse with infants
 Curing heads on top of spikes
 boiling skulls
 Skin sliding off of bones

 Voices
 The voices call
 Voices
 The voices are calling me
 Buried dead I've spiritually infected
 Call to me from beyond their graves

 Bleed
 I now bleed pus
 I bleed, the blood of the dead
 I bleed on her livid skin
 Thrusting myself within
 Beginning to chop through her hairless crotch
 Beyond what we know as death
 It haunts me everyday
 I hear the voice of every child
 That lies next to me decayed
 A fresh corpse, to fill with my infection
 Tortured before death, no orifice left unfilled

 Violated after death
 Virgin hole I infest
 Anal pore spewing cess
 The sacred juice I injest
 Your dead child I defile
 Necropedophile!!!!!111!!1!!

This song was written about a movie ""Johnny get your gun"" all of the lyrics were written about the character of the movie who was a soldier in war who had his legs, arms, sight, and hearing taken away by a landmine....(if u dl or can get a copy of the rare version of the song w/ the movie clippings they explain everything)
""Landmine Has Taken My Sight 
Taken My Speech 
Taken My Hearing 
Taken My Arms 
Taken My Legs""

This is single handedly one of if not the best song ever written.........it captures all points of music.....mixing differents beats, starting slow gettin heavy, switching bak, then full heavy and the lyrics are genius as they express so much emotion .....especially when played live.......and by the way SeasonS should b shot and hung upside down by his balls.....if ne1 can get there hands on his address im sure we could get him a nice nail bomb 4 christmas....

Awesome song with an awesome video.  The idea somehow came when Metallica were working on Master of Puppets about what it would be like if someone was alive but couldn't see, hear, or communicate with the world.  After hearing this idea, they were shown a movie, ""Johnny got his Gun"" and the guy was in a war and got all his limbs blown off and couldn't communicate but was still alive.  They wrote a song about this.

It's not only the movie.James wanted to write a song about his own self...he feels as though a landmine took all he had...arms,legs,eyes,ears,etc.He wanted to show what it is to be lonely and not just literally...lonely in like u and yourself...now and forever...no way of changing the situation.This is my favorite song and i can relate to it perfectly.

Based on the movie Johnny Got His Gun, and is about a man who was blown up by a landmine. He lost his Arms, Legs and all of his senses. It's a very strong song with a great build up and a thrashing solo. Metallica is trying to portray what this would be like, not knowing if your awake, sleeping, dead, or remembering. He is trapped inside of his own head, it is a concept that is very hard to imagine.

			It was actually a mortar strike he was blown up by. If you have read the book and watched during the scene with the explosion it was a mortar shell. You can also hear the screeching ( the ""SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSZZZZZZZZZZWOW...BOOM! sort of sound) of the shell.

I'm much more of a classic rock guy--probably a total wimp to any real metal head. 

But, hey, what can I say about this song?

Its lyrics and meaning are absolutely profound and can be atken literally reflecting the ""johnny"" book or taken figuratively as others have mentioned.  I really relate as I'm finally coming out of a 3 year depression. 

And the music!!! The intonation, etc of the lead singer (see, I don't even know his name) is emotional and you really feel pain when you here it. 

The way it goes form the sing song calm beat of a depressed guy plodding thru glum thoughts to the total frustration, rage, etc in the remainderis uncanny. This lead MUST have personal experience with mental illness, or he's just an incredibly insightful genius!

The dual guitar solo thing is just incredible thought the song does tend to sound at the end like they couldn't figure out where to cut it off, but hey no one is perfect.

			It is always nice to know what each song is *actually* about or based on, but I think all lyrics are open to personal interpretation. You relate to the song as you're coming out of a 3-year depression, while others may relate to it as they are battling addiction, and others have war stories to tell, too. It's so interesting to hear how everybody interprets and relates to a song and see that there are other people with similar (or even different and unique) thoughts, stories, or experiences.

I hope things are still well with you 4 years later!

What this song is really describing if james realizes it or not is the real reality, or the Matrix. its about war but also a mind war. The invisable mind prison we are in. Not one person on this planet has experienced true freedom because of this system in place. 

When you truly question this world you will see things are not what they seem and we are all in a complete state of confusion. We have lost touch with who we really are and james heitfield describes this in this quote.
'' I can't remember anything Can't tell if this is true or dream .Deep down inside I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops it there''

Now he describes when he felt most real and it doesnt involve being in this world but wishes it was.... See More
'' Back in the womb it's much too real, In pumps life that I must feel .But can't look forward to reveal . Look to the time when I'll live''

This describes the slave machines we have become and in the matrix film it is seen with plugs all over their body.
''Fed through the tube that sticks in me, Just like a wartime novelty. Tied to machines that make me be ,Cut this life off from me''.

Now james realizes how far out his beliefs are to most and how alone it makes him feel.
'' Now the world is gone I'm just one ,Oh god, help me ''

Finally the whole mind prison (matrix) described in what it does to people, be honest with your self. you may not even realize your confused. if your believe in this worlds system you have fallen into the trap.
'' Darkness imprisoning me, All that I see Absolute horror.... See More
I cannot live, I cannot die .Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell'' .

Its all a mind war in either being brainwashed and controlled or realizing truth. The battle has long ago for the robbery of your mind. They are very much winning the battle let me tell you.Release the poison they have infected you with if you have bought into this world.

this is about the impossibility of total communication between beings.

I absolutely love this song! I'm 25 years old and my husband passed away almost 7 months ago at the age of 25. He was in the ending stages of stomach cancer before we found out he had it. We were married for 1 year and 10 days. This song just really touches my heart and the lyrics speak what my heart feels.

@Babygirl86 















7 months ago my FiancÃ©e passed away due to sudden heart failure. Looking back on our last conversation I just remember him saying how blessed he was to have found his soul mate. Only hours after we said our goodbye and said our last I love you, he went to bed and never woke up. This song really speaks out to me in so many ways. 

“They say I’ll be okay,
But I’m not going to ever get over you.”

-People tell me all the time that I’m going to okay, but I don’t expect them to understand. What they don’t see, is that I wish so badly to die too. It’s so utterly painful to move on with life without my lover, my comforter, my home and my best friend. It’s so heart wrenching to think about having to start over from a shattered future and broken dreams. They say I’ll be okay, but my heart can’t bring myself to ever think of getting over him. 

“But you went away
How dare you, I miss you.” 

-Even though his passing is not his fault, I find myself getting angry at my love for leaving me here to fend for myself. I get angry for the despair and grief he has put me in. I feel so cold and naked in such a big world. He was my rock and was always by my side. Now it’s like I’m standing on this rock all alone, stranded. 

“It really sinks in, you know
When I see it in stone.”

-Because his passing was so sudden and disbelieving, it took awhile for a stone to be made for him. I try to go visit his grave often and bring roses (he loved buying me roses). The other week I went and there his name was- finally in stone. I froze and went numb all over. It was like starting all over again. I stayed there for an hour and just lied on the dirt where his body was laid and sobbed. It really does sink in when you see it stone. 

Everything else this song says I can really relate too as well. I went my first Christmas without him. I got through it with the help of my family. Last Christmas, was the best Christmas and last Christmas I had with him with so many memories that my family and I were able to look back on. Though hearing songs on the radio that we used to listen to over and over again is like getting hit by a truck, I sometimes can smile and remember the things we were doing when the song was being played. Like driving in his car on our long road trips to nowhere just blasting the music and singing at the top of our lungs. No cares in the world- Blaring the base to piss of the crabby neighbors when washing his car every Sunday...Just so many memories this song makes me think of, I wish I could just list them all here. 

Though this song is sad, I have found that it is good to cry and let it out. So I play this song, have a good cry and trudge forward and try and get through another day.

			Sadly I completely understand what you're saying. My boyfriend passed away about 8 months ago due to a car accident. I've found that I can totally relate to this song as well and like you I've cried several times when I heard it. Sometimes it's best just to have a good cry and let all your emotions out instead of keeping them bottled up inside, because that only makes it worse.

I've had so many people tell me that I'm going to be ok, and in some ways I believe them. I know that I'll make it through another day. But there are still so many days where I can't believe a word they say and I'm so ready to give up because all I want is him by my side the way it was supposed to be. It's so hard to think positive when all you can think about it what was supposed to have happened. We should have been planning our wedding by now. He had the ring and everything.

I don't think I can ever get over him.

7 months ago my FiancÃ©e passed away due to sudden heart failure. Looking back on our last conversation I just remember him saying how blessed he was to have found his soul mate. Only hours after we said our goodbye and said our last I love you, he went to bed and never woke up. This song really speaks out to me in so many ways. 

“They say I’ll be okay,
But I’m not going to ever get over you.” 
-	People tell me all the time that I’m going to okay, but I don’t expect them to understand. What they don’t see, is that I wish so badly to die too. It’s so utterly painful to move on with life without my lover, my comforter, my home and my best friend. It’s so heart wrenching to think about having to start over from a shattered future and broken dreams. They say I’ll be okay, but my heart can’t bring myself to ever think of getting over him. 
“But you went away
How dare you, I miss you.” 
-	Even though his passing is not his fault, I find myself getting angry at my love for leaving me here to fend for myself. I get angry for the despair and grief he has put me in. I feel so cold and naked in such a big world. He was my rock and was always by my side. Now it’s like I’m standing on this rock all alone, stranded. I cry “How dare you! How could you! I miss you!!!!”
“It really sinks in, you know
When I see it in stone.”
-	Because his passing was so sudden and disbelieving, it took a while for a stone to be made for him. I try to go visit his grave often and bring roses (he loved buying me roses).

My ex-boyfriend died almost a year ago from a drug overdose. His dad got him into them when he was only thirteen or fourteen and he tried quitting so many times. He was such a beautiful person, but I couldn't do it any more and broke up with him in december. We stayed friends, but when he dropped out of high school I stopped talking to him for a long time. The last time I talked to him he asked me for money and I said no and that I couldn't talk because everyone in my house was asleep. I was kind of rude, it makes me want to cry every time I think about it. I really loved him, he died about three months after I talked to him, in June. This song reminds me of him because I will never get over this boy. He was only nineteen, would have turned twenty in February. It made me cry at work the other day, even though I should be over it...right? Rest in peace Harrison.

This song is definitely better than some of the songs on Manipulator. It shows the group's progression into the sound that they have been working towards. I think that The Fall of Troy have finally mixed their songwriting skills with their skillful musicianship. This album should be the fusion of Doppelganger and Manipulator.

It could be about a drinking problem..And the reason why I say this is because of this line, ""overwhelmed by this complex delirium"". Now, if you look delirium up in the dictionary, it says that an episode of delirium is usually caused by the withdrawal from alchohol, which in turn, causes all of the things described in this song (delusions, dehydration, seizures..etc). This song is awesome, though, my favorite song from the Octavarium with Never Enough & The Root Of All Evil trailing close behind.

I feel this song is about being an enabler. It can be to an addiction, and abusive relationship, to your own personal demons, what have you. In any case, you are faced with the decision to care, which requires strength and entails a lot of emotional pain as you head down the path of rightousness. Your other choice is to plead silence, the weaker choice of accepting the status quo and doing nothing at the cost of happiness.

Some corrections. Trust me on these:

Can keep refusing right -----> Can't keep refusing rights.
Weekends are calling --------> Weak hands are calling.
(Fate)-----------------------> (Face)

Great song, and sentimentally powerful. One of my favs to sing at karaoke.

			I look at this song differently. I think this song is about a person is too nice and hurts himself because of it, or a pushover. Reminds me a lot of my brother. 

-The first verse is talking about someone asking the pushover for money knowing he'll ""give in again"" and Pete's like ""the bastard"" like get it together man, you ""can't keep refusing rights"". Everyone has rights over what they're willing to do, and the pushover just gives up to others pleas too easily. Pete says ""so he'll loan the cash/ but the sin is on the hands of you"". He's talking to the person that got the money out of his friend and he's like you know you just used someone you douche.
-In the chorus, ""weak hands are calling"" is a reference to the people who ask things from you. Pete says ""plead silence"" and don't give in basically.
-second verse is kinda self explanatory, kind of confusing to the rest of song (unusual for Chevelle)
-the bridge is saying stop living your life with so many rules. don't listen to what others tell you and only care about yourself and what makes you happy.

			also...

sure....not a problem.
read this paragraph from an interview with Chevelle during their first cd.
Criticized by conservatives, embraced by many Christians, and supported by rock enthusiasts in all walks of life, there probably isn't a band more entrenched in the ""are they/aren't they?"" debate than Chevelle. Given the ""Christian band"" label the moment their Squint Entertainment debut Point #1 hit store shelves, the band of brothers acquired the title by default, not necessarily because they wanted to. ""It's something that's probably going to follow us around forever and that's fine,"" drummer Sam Loeffler once told Entertainment Insiders. ""It's pretty simple. We originally signed with a record company that was backed by Word [Records], so the record was in Christian bookstores. It was really an accidental thing.""

This song Is about those children we see on T.V. all the time and people are trying to get us to send In money to help them out. This could explain the ""bastard"". This Is part of an interview with Sam that explains It. 

""KNAC.COM: I wanted to ask you about “Panic Prone.” 
LOEFFLER: “Panic Prone” is an interesting song because I’ve just recently learned what it’s about. Pete was watching television and one of those commercials came on, ‘Save the Children’ commercials. That song is about making a decision whether you’re going to sit on your couch and watch this happen or you’re going to stand up and do something about it. That song isn’t about if you should or shouldn’t do it, its’ just about – Are you going to do it? Is this my problem? I was really surprised that it was about that. I think one of the lines is actually about one of our friend’s falling off the wagon, too. I think the first line might be about that.""

Chevelle was NEVER a CHristian band. They were labled as that...and tried to distance themselvesfrom it from the start. Because someones songs refer to spirituality and a higher power doesnt mean they are Christian. But you CHristians would love if a band as bad ass as Chevelle backed you. ;-) SO I can see what you said this. And Kruzen you dumb shit I can explain why they are signed to the label. Because when youre nobody as a band and ANYONE asks to sign you you dont say no. Can YOU tell while this quote was posted in 2004 it is irrelevant because they had already signed to Epic. Fuck...think before speaking...but since youre a busted fucking condom read a book.

The song means this as many may disagree but this is actual fact: 

When we sit in front of a TV and one of those ""help the children"" commercials come on.  We all do it...we sit there thinking should we call in and help?  To end the catastrophic Scene that is unfolding in front of our eyes?  The song is not about whether or not you should or should not do it, it is about the deliberation of sitting there taking no action or to actually say f'it Im going to do somethin this time no more waiting for the next opportunity.  ""These images hauntingly look like hell"" and should we ""loan the cash"" but the sin's on the hands of you.  Its all there, read it with this in mind as being the meaning.  It makes perfect sense.

Heck, I'm about 13 years late. But whatevs.

This song is about the redundancy of saying you're going to do something.

I think Pete even said that the song wasn't about a should or shouldn't, it was about a would or wouldn't. Like, if you want to change something, are you going to? Or are you NOT going to?

No one ever thinks much on this, at least, I haven't.

I think the lyrics shed a much brighter light on a darker issue. The fact that most of us complain about changes that should be made. We just don't end up DOING anything about it. That's the deeper chasm of reality we haven't quite explored, yet.

A November 1918 edition of The Times printed a report called Behind the Veil . A part of it says, ""Alarm gongs had already sent the guns' crews to their invisible guns and immediately after the explosion 'Panic stations' was ordered, followed in due course by 'Abandon ship.'""

The story is about a Q-Ship called the HMS Prize . A Q-ship was a boat made to look like a slow, rusting cargo ship, but in reality was a naval ship that could do battle. They were used during WWI against German U-boats.

From the story, the meaning of the command ""panic stations,"" seems to be that sailors need to be on alert and ready to abandon ship if necessary as it the command was followed by the command ""abandon ship.""

So, I wonder if this song isn't about being prepared for the inevitable crash of society as we know it. With that said I'll do a line-by-line explanation as i see it.

      You won't get much closer
      Until you sacrifice it all (all)
We can only achieve so much without stepping out of our comfort zone. The ultimate victory isn't going to be realized until we are willing to give up our life lines (money, fame, habits, whatever they might be) for the greater prize.
      You won't get to taste it
      With your face against the wall (wall, wall)
Having your face against a wall implies that you are being put there by an authority figure or bully. Like a cop that is apprehending a suspect or someone being fought in a bar/alley fight. You won't get to taste that greater prize if you continue to let others control you.
      Get up and commit
      Show the power trapped within (in, in)
Commit to taking control of your own life. You have the power to exact the change you want to see even if you have never used it before.
      Do just what you want to
      And now stand up and begin (uh)
What do you want? What is the change that you want to see? Start on it now. Hurry up.

      Ooooo 1, 2, 3, 4 fires in your eyes
You are burning with determination now. Your dreams are fueling the fire that you have lit in your life.
      And this chaos, it defies imagination
But all of this change is creating chaos beyond your imagination.
      Ooo 5, 6, 7, 8 minus 9 lives 
[I'm not sure about this one line.]
      You've arrived at Panic Station
The point of no return. You either change or you might as well abandon ship.

      Doubts will try to break you
      Unleash your heart and soul (soul)
You're going to run ino some problems but if you stop holding yourself back then you will have a fighting chance
      Trouble will surround you
      Start taking some control-(trol!)
You are not a slave to anyone or anything, especially your own emotions.Control them, don't let them control you.
      Stand up and deliver
      Your wildest fantasy (sy, sy)
give yourself permission to reach for your dreams.
      Do what the fuck you want to
      There's no one to appease (ee, ee)
This can be taken 2 ways, either you don't have to please some non-existent God (if you are atheist) or even if there is a God you still don't have to please anyone on Earth but yourself. You are the person that will live with you forever. What are you going to put up with?

      And I know that you will fight for the duration
You can do it. I believe in you.
      And I know I'm not resisting the temptations
The temptation is to stay away from our comfort zones, enact changes to make the world better. I sure don't want to resist that temptation either.

			Well done!!!! Right on the mark!
The minus 9 lives part is tryna say- We're not cats, we don't have 9 lives so make the most of the one your living whilst your living.

NOW LETS GO TO PANIC STATION AND TAKE SOME CONTROL (TROL!)			







+1








 
			I agree with Shredd. I was going to say it just a little different, but the same way. Cats have ""9 lives"". When they hit ""minus 9"", they're down to zero. So, he's basically saying that when you've run out of options/run out of alternatives...that's when ""You've arrived at Panic Station"". Time to go get something (whatever it may be) DONE!

I honestly don't see there being much meaning behind this song, they just tried to make a catchy diddy (hence the use of counting) and boy oh boy did they succeed. If I had to squeeze an interpretation though, I'd say it's a continuation of the entire album's chaotic theme (second law of thermodynamics/entropy) and how inciting chaos is a way to make human beings feel in control -- especially under a totalitarian regime.

For me it is about CHAOS in mind. Feeling, when you understand that you lost your way to get the goal, the meaning of your life. You thought you're glorious, but now realized that you are piece of crap. In imagination you can be someone else, you can change everything NOW, but in reality - you are too weak to conquer temptations that control yourself and you really don't know what you want to change . This song is about fight. Imagination, glorious, ideal ME vs. real ME...

870,Panic Switch.json,"
The chorus is wrong

When you see yourself in a crowded room, 
do your finger itch? are you pistol whipped?
And will you step in line or release the glitch?
And can you sleep with a panic switch?

Actually most of the song is wrong...

Time
It's never worth my time
Blue shine
Bleeds into my eyes

I still
Sleep on the right side
Of the white noise
Can't leave the scene behind

Could I be anything you want me to be
It's always meant to be seen

[Chorus]
When you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch, are you pistol-whipped?
And will you step in line or release the glitch?
And can you fall asleep with a panic switch?

And when you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch, are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with the panic...

Mm, I'll try
To hold on tight tonight
Pink slip
Inviting me inside
Wanna burn skin
And brand what once was mine
But the red views
Keep ripping the divide

If I go everywhere you want me to go
How will I know you'll still follow?

[Chorus]

I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating

I'm waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading, waiting and fading

[Chorus]

I can't believe nobody's gotten it yet. And, hello guys, a song can have multiple meanins at once. So yes, it's about the music industry, I see that. It's ALSO definitely about an anxiety attack. But put the pieces together, and you get a song that's about a guy's anxiety towards being an individual. This song is about how everyone's becoming the same, not just the music industry, but society in general. The ""speaker"" in this song is panicking because he feels like he needs to conform, but really doesn't want to. He values his individuality and is freaking out about how to keep it.

AND THE CHORUS IS WRONG.AH.
""Do you see yourself in a crowded room?         
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?   
Do you step in line, or release the glitch?     
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?""

The meaning:

among all of the clones, do you stand out?
are you like me, dying to be allowed to be yourself?
so are you going to be a clone, or release the glitch and be yourself?
can you fall asleep knowing this? (referring to his extreme anxiety)

So in one sentence, the song is about whether to fall in line with everyone else and be normal, or be yourself and succumb to the panic attacks.

Here is my explanation i think i may have hit bulls eye with this one - let me know what you guys think

song is about someone that got cheated on

Time.
It's never worth my time.
Moonshine
Bleeds into my eyes.

-thinking about her is never worth my time, moonshine - maybe the name of the gf
bleeds into my eyes - wants to cry

I still
Sleep on the right side
Of the white noise;
Can't leave the scene behind.

-i still sleep on the right side of the bed we used to sleep on together
-white noise = white bed
-cant forget what happened


Do you see yourself in a crowded room?
Do you think I'll snitch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Do you step in line, or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep when I panic, switch?

-do u see youself (ex-gf) surrounded by your guilt (crowd)
-do you think i'll tell anyone what u did to me
-are you pistal (dick) whipped
-can you fall asleep when i panic - panic as in the emotion in you waking up in a nightmare that your gf is cheating on you

When you see yourself in a crowded room,
Do you think I'll snitch? Are you pistol whipped?
Will you step in line or release this glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with the panic?

-when your about to fuck
-do you think i'll tell anyone what u did to me
-are you pistal (dick) whipped
=will you stop yourself, will say fuck it and open your legs
-ow you think she'll sleep with that feeling of guild

And I'll try to hold on tight tonight.
Pink slip, inviting me inside.
I want to burn skin and brand what once was mine,
But the red news came ripping in to fight.

-i'll try to wait another day for you
-that pussy (pink slip) is what im lusting for
-i want to brand ur ass, because you were once mine
-but i know what you did, and im angry and wont lose to your lust

If I go anywhere that you want me to go,
How do I know you'll still follow?

-if i forgive you, how do i know you wont cheat again

I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating.

-im waiting for something, but as i waiting my feelings for you are floating away

I'm waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading and floating away

-im waiting for something, but as i waiting my feelings for you are floating away
Waiting and fading and flailing and fading

@KTheLibra 















I think this song is about being led on sexually by an ex with whom you're still in love. It's like the ex just came back for sex, but you're hoping that they actually want you again. With the anxiety of that situation, you're unable to connect to other people and you wonder if everybody around you can tell that you're losing it. 


""Time is never worth my time 
Blue shine bleeds into my eyes""
I feel like this part means that it has happened before, and that it's acknowledged that it hasn't worked out well before.

""I still sleep on the right side 
But white noise can't leave the scene behind""
You still sleep in the bed where you both used to sleep, and there's a ""white noise"" presence of emptiness left in the ex's place.

""Could I be anything you want me to be 
If so is it meant to be seen?""
Questioning whether or not you're willing to do anything the ex wants in order to get them to come back emotionally.

""I'll try to hold on tight tonight 
Pink slip inviting me inside"" 
Trying to savor the emotionless moments with the ex because you're realizing it's purely sexual.

""Want to burn skin and brand what once was mine 
But the red views keep ripping the divide""
Wanting to make 100% certain that the ex will stick around.

""If I go everywhere you want me to go 
How will I know you'll still follow""
Questioning yourself about whether or not it's worth your time to play along with the ex.

@cg1303 















I think its about someone fighting with themself. his alter ego is taking over and he is holding on but its overwhelming. he is dying..

time is never worth my time 
blue shine bleeds into my eyes
i still sleep on the right side
but white noise can't leave the scene behind

- everything is a blur, sleeping the day away, waking up and the sky blinds you and you are so consumed with all the chaos (white noise sound frequencies) 

could i be anything you want me to be
if so is it meant to be seen

-shows how reliant he has become on the voice inside him/cant trust his instinct, doesnt know if its worth it anymore

when you see yourself in a crowded room
do your fingers itch are you pistol whipped
will you step in line or release the glitch
can you fall asleep with a panic switch

-he is talking to the voice/alter ego inside himself, because he is essentially just a body because he is so controlled by his alter ego, when he's surrounded by people, his fingers itch/hes so anxious, its painful because he's beginning to get that he is dying (pistol whipped), he is so weak he can fall asleep even with all that he is dealing with, hes becoming numb, he is asking his alter ego, but in a way as if to say you dont have to go through all this.


i'll try to hold on tight tonight
pink slip inviting me inside

-he could die anytime, he feels the termination coming on

want to burn skin and brand what once was mine
but the red views keep ripping the divide

-i want to go back to myself, i want my body back, i want to live without this obsession with listening to the voices inside your head (relates back to white noise theory), but the red views (voices/alter ego overpowers you)

if i go everywhere you want me to go
how will i know you'll still follow

-he doesnt know if he can trust or listen to himself anymore, he doesnt know if his good intuition will follow him much longer


will you step in line or release the glitch
do you think she'll sleep with a panic...


-speaking to himself again, will you let go of me when you finally see that ive had enough???


i'm waiting and fading and floating...
i'm waiting and fading and floating away
i'm waiting and fading and floating away
i'm waiting and fading and floating away

-he thinks and does the same thing everday, just like time is not a factor, he is waiting for something, but really its just nothing, he cannot think for himself anymore.. he is dying...

(just a thought, of course every song means something different to each person)

I think this song is more about having trusted somebody for a long time, and suddenly they hurt you, and you don't know what to do.

""Panic Switch"" seems to symbolize quickly ""flipping a switch"" in your everyday life, and not being used to it.

""If I go anywhere you want me to go, how will I know you'll still follow?""
""I'm waiting and fading and floating away.""
""Could I be anything you want me to be?""

@jrspeak32 















The song provides a glimpse into the fragile emotional state of someone soon after their world has been flipped upside down by a major betrayal or other traumatic events. It about dealing with the unknowns, uncertainty, and doubt that follow when things you thought you knew reveal themselves to not be true. 

The individual knows that to heal they need to put aside time to work through what has happened, but doing so may require them to revisit painful events and discover other things they don't want to know. So instead, the individual tries to go on living their life and stay busy with work and other activities. But the fear & hurt from the unresolved issues are always right below the surface, leaving them in a perpetual state of anxiety and panic.

The individual may have been in a very intense, but probably unhealthy, relationship with someone whome they cared for alot. Over time the relationship likely experienced increasing amounts of betrayal of trust such as infidelity and perhaps abuse. While the individual was the recipient of these betrayals early on, he was submissive and may have made excuses which justified the the actions of his partner. But as the relationship escalated his emotions eventually got the best of him and he himself ended fighting back and contributing to the toxicty of the relationship in ways he never thought were possible.

Now that the relationship is over, he can't ignore the fact that the relationship has changed him. His ideas of what is ""normal"" and what is ""right or wrong"" have shifted, but not in the way he'd like. He wonders if he can still be the person he always wanted to be? Or is he now as damaged as his previous partner? Will he be able to control this newly discovered side of himself which seems to be triggered so easily now, or is he destined to repeat the cycle of toxity in his future relationships. Is he putting anyone close to him at risk?

@zmcmahon 















Brian himself said it was about a mental/nervous break down (say maybe a panic attack?) and the lyrics all seem to point to different events and situations where they could be happening. The opening verses seem almost to be a stab at the music biz, but the choruses and prechoruses seem more like a couple trying to keep each other calm through the chaos that's around them. IDK, I love Brian's lyrics, but can't always decipher them.

			I can see that. Like,

could mean, will you stop being crazy and freaking out and be like everyone else?
and a lot of people have agoraphobia, a fear of crowds, so being in a crowded room can bring on a panic attack.

871,Panic.json,"
The song was written in response to Steve Wright (Radio 1 DJ) playing Wham I'm your Man after the lunchtime ""Newsbeat"" which went out at 1230-1250 on Radio One.  I recollect it was a Monday around April 1986.  Apparently both Marr and Morrissey were appalled to hear Steve Wright report the Chernobyl disaster on the radio and then follow it by playing the Wham song and in an interview with NME in 1987, Marr says:

""'Panic' came about at the time of Chernobyl. Morrissey and myself were listening to a Newsbeat radio report about it. The story about this shocking disaster comes to an end and then, immediately, we're off into Wham!'s 'I'm Your Man'. I remember actually saying 'what the fuck has this got to do with peoples' lives?' We hear about Chernobyl, then, seconds later, we're expected to be jumping around to 'I'm Your Man'.""

@CharmingMan 















After listening to the news of the Chernobyl disaster on Radio 1, Wham's 'I'm Your Man' was played immediatly after. Morrissey wrote this song, criticisng the 'pop' music that was around at this time as he was disgusted in what he heard. I felt for a while that 'The music that they constantly play, it says nothing to me about my life', but you learn to let that go. I hardly listen to the radio and very few new artists interest me at the moment. The Smiths are a band that fascinate me and I don't think I will ever stop listening to their music.

			When I first heard this, thought the beginning of chorus was ""hank the DJ"" as opposed to Hang the DJ. Ever wonder why they dont play smiths songs that often. thats a toughie!			

Im guessing the kids singing in the background is another reference to chernobyll? Anyway, this is what I love about the Smiths. Most people think the songs are just depressing but can't see the underlying humour and wit. 

Chinup hit the nail bang on the head. The song is about, as well as chernobyll, music with no soul. Music that says nothing to you about your life. Miss chainsaws thing about dance music not using real instruments is a bit of a stupid thing to say seeing as a hell of a lot of people who make dance music are clasically trained artists. Download a song like Max Graham-gone or massive attack-unfinished sympathy and tell me they say nothing to you about your life. Obviously there is poppy dance too, but dance music speaks to me. Even if its not got lyrics it can conjour up memories, evoke emotions. Its about the passion. After all a room full of hundreds of people worshipping the music and sharing a feeling, or a kid at home spending all his money on records to play on his decks working towards playing his music to other people wouldnt be possible without the passion or if the music was made purely to sell records.  

These days the music this song Id consider applies to would be Pop trash and same old 50cent moaning about smashing peoples legs and bitches RNB and hip hop. But then not all hip hop is like that. Grandmaster Flash and the furious five, public enemy, even NWA all had something to say that was important. I guess what Im saying is that you can't just condemn a genre of music as being not ""real music."" The thing that defines it is if the music can speak to people about something, be it political, emotional, whatever. Music that doesnt misses the point.

It's about Steve Wright's coverage of the Chernobyl disaster, right? Or at least that sparked it off. Still, it could have applied to so many of the Radio 1 DJs.

Of coursem there were the good/great ones (John Peel, of course), but then there were the ones who were basically just Smashie and Nicie personified.

""but you run down to the safety of the town""
...is referencing the element of music ""that says nothing about my life""...
it's not so much just talking about safe music for the masses but about the issues, the ""music"" that people are controlled by because it keeps them from paying mind to the important issues in their lives instead of the fluffy 'pop' issues.  So really, get off the song's impetus about Chernobyl and Wham and bad DJs... it's about the people that want to feel the safety and ease that comes with eating the free handouts...and doing something about those that do this as a means of obfuscation/control/etc.  ""Hang"" the man behind the Wizard's curtain; take back control, do what you will and think and wish to do.  Stop being led by other's agendas.

			You're taking the line out of context.

'Hopes may rise on the Grasmere, but honey pie, you're not safe here, so you run down to the safety of the town.'

The Grasmere is an area of national beauty that is 25 miles from the notorious Sellafield/Windscale nuclear site. After the Windscale fire in the 1950's sheep were found dead in the fields in the Grasmere.

I always saw this song as political. Typical of Morrissey as he was incredibly critical of Thatcher's Britain. The disco is West Minister. The DJ is Margaret Thatcher. Because the music they constantly play (Choices made by the conservative government of the 80's) means nothing to be about my life (Positively affects only the affluent of the country and is either damaging or irrelevant to the working classes.)

I know this isn't what the song is about or why it was written but its one interpretation. =]

A song that defines the time it was released, but if you're thinking of downloading it, with typical internet ignorance, you'd probably be better off searching for a non-existant song called 'Hang The DJ'. Tss.

This whole album deals with spiritual enlightenment(with the climax at the end of Reflection). Parabola specifically deals with the illusory nature of the self.

""We barely remember who or what came before"" -> Our memories are very limited, but they create a story of our ""selves"" despite that. It's just an illusion, the song tells us to focus on the now(a common theme in spirituality) and that our bodies are just a temporary form of being.

The other songs on Lateralus all focus on different aspects of the main spiritual truth that Reflection tries to convey.

The Grudge/Schism are about our relationships with other beings and how futile it is to separate ourselves from them. We are, after all, all one mind.

The Patient/Ticks and Leeches are about dealing with the struggles that come along the path to spritual enlightenment. The incredible amount of patience it requires, the negative influences from the outside world, etc.

Lateralus is about the exploration of ourselves and just the general size and scope of what there is to discover.

Many people call Tool hard to understand, but they actually convey very simple messages in their music. That's part of what makes them so great, their universal applicability to almost all situations.

Even looking at their discogtaphy as a whole sort of shows a cool trend. Opiate was very ""me and them"", the ideas are very typical of an individual angry at society and at himself.

Undertow and Aenima show a more inward approach, especially on Aenima. Third Eye is sort of like the precursor to Lateralus, the final understanding of truth.

Lateralus is sort of climax of their work.

10,000 Days is sort of like Opiate, in that it includes lots of societal criticism, but from a new perspective. It criticizes it in terms of ""we"", rather than ""they.""

Do I really think Tool's discography is like one big concept album? No, but the trend is definitely there.

We don't remember what we were before we were alive in this physical form.  We choose to stay alive in this physical form.  It is a great gift to be alive.  We can look at all the other bodies around us and see that we are obviously not alone in this world.  Other's share our pain and our joy.  Just by being born we have an effect on the lives of other people.  But this body, this physical form, is only a vessel for our ""soul"".  Our soul is what makes us different from every other person.  It is my personal belief that our soul is the same thing as our mind.  Our body gives our soul a chance to experience life and what it means to be alive.  To have memories.  To love and to hate.  To feel pain and joy.  We have to remember that we are not a collection of memories.  We are not our professions.  We are not what others see when they look at us or even the way we try to project ourselves to the world.  Inside we are a mind truly capable of anything, but limited by the body we are given.  Even so, we should embrace this chance to be alive.  Our body will die.  Our soul will live on.  Of course this is all just hope.  But we need hope.  I need hope.  This body holding me can't be all that I am.  My mind can't be just a series of synaptic connections and chemical reactions.  There is more to us than science will ever even begin to explain.  I highly recommend the Ender's Game book series by Orson Scott Card for anybody who like's this song and want to read an excellent book that gets deeper into what we are and what makes us human.  Ending thought:  Try and empathize with people.  People act a certain way because their body is imperfect.  There is a reason for everything, nomatter how irrational.  Learn to love others nomatter how much they hate you.  It is hard.  I know.  Damn do I ever know.  I am imperfect, too.  I hope you all find happiness without sacrificing the happiness of anybody else.  Good tidings and Farewell.

This song is about the Spiritualist belief in the birth process; it has nothing to do with sex really.  We are spirit forms until we will ourselves into a physical form.  During the infant stage, our spirit (or second self as I call it) moves in and out of our body with ease, as it's not yet grounded in the physical world.  The lyrics demand that we are alive because we chose to be, and we should cherish this opportunity.  Pain is truly not an illusion, but can be manipulated into suck when one looks at the big picture.  Our bodies are vehicles that carry our astral minds.  We are eternal.

That or it could possibly be relating to death by suicide. The deep depression that some of us feel. That when the walls come down and we are left alone, there are only 2 options: end it now, or find hope and place faith in overcoming our insecurities. ""Pain is an illusion"", I know that statement has kept me here in this world. The thought of that statement gives me the strength to go through one more day. I remember that all that is physical, is ill-logical. It is only a destraction. I must stay focused on what my life is about. In the song right before this one on Tool's album Maynard asks, ""Is this a Test? It has to be. Otherwise I can't go on."" To me that is what I feel when I hear it. It is the feeling of hope and inspiration, a chance to go on. But that's me. Things have different meaning for different people.

			I actually agree with your reference to suicide.  I was just listening to the song and thinking, ""if pain is an illusion and we truly are eternal, why is he stressing the fact that we need to embrace this body and the chance to be alive if we are never going to die anyway?  If we are eternal then I don't care about this insignificant life.""  That's when I thought of the suicide aspect.  If you are so depressed and thinking about ending your life, you still will not die, just your physical body will.  Your soul will look back and regret that decision because it made no difference; all that pain you were experiencing wasn't real anyway.  If you had just realized that fact you could have gotten the most out of that physical life.  Now you ended it too early and moved on to some different aspect of eternal living.  Basically, our souls are only occupying these bodies once, so make the most of it, because once your body dies you won't get it back.  That's how it relates to suicide, so that dude above me callin everyone emo is a dumbass.

			Actually the song has nothing to do with suicide at all. It's a very positive song (just like most of their stuff). The song is about this miniscule moment in time that we as spirits have been actually placed into this world..onto this earth. The one thing that none of the ""gods"" have ever had the chance to do. To be mortal and eternal at the same time. In short, enjoy the ability to see, hear, smell, smile, love, etc...because it is only for a flicker in time that we get to do this. Do not be sad when something earthly seems to be troubling, it is only of this world and it isnt real, not in the grand scheme of things. It is a ""Holy"" moment, a gift, given to us by the Creator of all. Once this is realized it becomes more easily understood and appreciated. Yes,...all this pain IS an illusion.

This song, to me, is a short writing of the ultimate truth one can attain while being alive on this earth, in this vibration, and on this plane of awareness. The ""parable"" here is that ""we"", humans are an extension of our cosmic counterpart i.e. God. We are ALL one being and Life, is the experience of a divided single consciousness within human avatars. Meaning, we, all, us, god, CHOSE to ""divide"" and live! ""This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone"" Not alone meaning, life is many. Consciousness of ONE is alone.
The ""illusion"" is that there is NO DEATH! But only a constant cycle of infinite existence/consciousness.  
Destroy the ego side and experience ""death"" of the ""self"" only to come back ""here"" and realize we are humans and ONLY this ""reality"" will end... Our fleshy vessels will retire... mortality. ""This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality. Embrace this moment. Remember; we are eternal, all this pain is an illusion."" The ""moment"" being when you return to the consciousness of ONE, when the ego dies.
These men have experienced ""death"" of the ego as have I. I KNOW this is exactly what they are trying to convey... I hope you will consider what I have said and pay more attention to other lyrics from other songs. Their core message, their entire mission, is to be the 'Tool' for humans to find this truth... The Philosopher's Stone, the Holy Grail...

There was an error.





@I_hate_user_names 















Oh, Jeez, people, this is about the most sarcastic song I've ever heard, right up with ""Sultans of Swing"".

Look, it's not straightforward at all.  Let me break it down for you:

""In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of ev’ry head he’s had the pleasure to know.""

He keeps a set of photos of everyone famous he's met, like an autograph book.  Not too out there, but still strange behavior.

""And all the people that come and go
Stop and say ‘Hello’.""

The ordinary people of Penny Lane/Liverpool want to be near greatness, so they participate in the oddity, and stop in to look at the photos of people they'll never be.

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at him behind his back.""

A rich banker (the motorcar shows he's rich) has lots of illegitimate children, their presence is mocking him (probably because he has to pay off their mothers)

""And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain - very strange.""

Mack = raincoat = rubber = condom.  Even though it's likely to get him ANOTHER illegitimate child (bastard), he continues to have sex without rubbers (because he's arrogant or likes the feeling better, whichever)

""Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes,
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sitt, and meanwhile back""

He's (Paul) sitting observing and listening and ferreting out what is driving the people he sees - what's beneath the surface of their daily lives

""In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It’s a clean machine.""

A man who keeps punctuality as a goal.  Very indicative of the British Condition, subverting all of one's desires to an admiration and striving for a goal that one can keep, instead.  He keeps a portrait of the Queen, another person he'll never reach or touch, but his perversion is that the Queen - a 'handsome' woman - is his masturbatory fantasy, and, like clockwork - punctually - he masturbates (keeps the fire engine clean) often - it is, after all, a clean machine, worthy of the Queen.

""Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes,
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer meanwhile back""

In the summer, when things are warm and free-er, boys finger women in the streets after dark...

""Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.""

She's selling medical morphine and other narcotics to supplement her income.  Nothing to do with war remembrance; it's a juxtaposition of the pretty nurse trafficking in stolen narcotics.

""And though she feels as if she’s in a play
She is anyway.""

Her actions are surreal to her, feeling justified because it's all unreal; but all the world's a stage, and she's a player doing it for Paul's benefit (his observation).

""In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim""

The Banker is waiting to see a mistress, and using the barber as a reason for being out of the office.

""And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain - very strange.""

The fireman is afraid of women - the pouring rain symbolizes (as above) the potential for fathering children - and he rushes indoors (would rather masturbate because women terrify him).

Now, children, THAT's what the song is about.

I grew up listening to the Beatles daily because my older sister was a HUGE fan. She was 13 when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan show. I'm Canadian, but my wife is from Liverpool and grew up just a few blocks away from Penny Lane. We went back to England on our honeymoon (20 years ago) and her grandmother walked us both down to Penny Lane. Road signs in England are usually tacked onto a corner wall at the intersections (a opposed to using a pole). The Penny Lane sign had been stolen so many times the city council finally decided to paint the name ""Penny Lane"" right on the brickwork! Yes, the street was in very nice, and yes there is in fact a roundabout! Rows of shops on both sides of the street, and many flower beds here and there. Penny Lane is a LOVELY song about truly nice place with warm, friendly people!

Mac is short for mackintosh (somebody said it was slang for raincoat, which it is, I'm just being nitpicky :)
Anyway, they were invented by some Scottish guy named Charles Macintosh in the early 1800's (1824?? Something like that.) They added the 'k' later. Also, British people call Wellingtons (which are boots) 'wellies'. British people are cool. I wish I was British.

@CoinXOperatedXGirl It simply means: 'if I close my eyes, I can still see/hear how that street looks and sounds, because it still is vivid in my memory'.			

Just like it's companion piece ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", ""Penny Lane"" is a song dealing with childhood nostalgia. Or to be more precise, a now grown up man achingly trying to reach for that youthful perspective of the world, which obviously makes him happy, since he is nowadays probably stuck in a more troubled life.

Because the storyteller is not really there, you see. His ""observations"" are rather a kaleidoscopic collage of images and impressions, assembled during his childhood days (and adolescence as well, judging from the veiled sexual allegorys - the ""clean machine"" part could be a reference, the ""finger pie"" one certainly is). Instead he quite literarily sits ""behind the blue suburban skies"", not so much imaging the place as reminiscing it.

While both ""Penny Lane"" and ""Strawberry Fields"" are essentially happy nostalgic song, there are disturbing things lurking just beneath the surface. While the latter has a slightly frightening theme underlying it, the nature of ""Penny Lane"" is more of a sad one (would Macca ever write a truly frightening song? - never mind ""Helter Skelter""). While the refrain should count as one of the peppiest pieces of pop music ever written (exactly evocative of the feeling the storyteller is trying to get across), there are certain moments in the song where the melody, if only for a few seconds, turns moodier. The point where the mood gets most anxious coincides with the line ""she feels as if she's in a play - she is anyway"". This must be interpreted as the cynical grown up's rationalizing of the the Childhood Dreamer, even though they are the same person (or maybe the sober Paul reaching through to the high Paul - I'll leave the drug talk to others). And this is where the tragic aspects of the song (and the whole concept of nostalgia) becomes evident; the dream can never really be realized.

But we always find ourself returning to the bittersweet nursings of nostalgia, don't we? Just as we keep returning to ""Penny Lane"". This is truly one of the Beatles' very best songs.

The following comments are biased as I am a big Nick Cave fan. I really like this meloncolic song as it reminds me it is about the complexities of human relationships and how they can and do change. Being a person who likes to help people out and give ""people the benefit of the doubt"" can leave me exposed to people abusing my trust. I have thought of some people as friends and it turns out that they are just ""using you"". This song is about the human condition. I have to be careful not to do the above to others - I do not think I'm the type, but, I am human too.

So really, people ain't no good, because even if you love someone they can still die.

			I think prodigal has a good point there: nowhere in the song does it sound like his love actually betrayed him. In fact, these lines:

The winter slammed us like a fist
The windows rattling in the gales
To which she drew the curtains
Made out of her wedding veils

Make it sound like that when hard times hit, she helped get them threw it through the strength of her commitment.

And the song also has a strong sense of passing time (""Seasons passing"") and it sounds like the song's protagonist actually refers to his love's death (although he makes it sound impersonal or hypothetical):

They can comfort you, some even try
They nurse you when you're ill of health
They bury you when you go and die

I think this song is so sad because it's about the inevitability of love leading to real pain, not because betrayal is inevitable - but just because everything must come to an end eventually. God that's depressing. Time for bed.

			I respectfully disagree. I don't think the song is about actual death in the first place, and even if it was - death is a fact of life. Sad maybe, but I don't think it should be ""depressing"" as such. I'm not in denial either. If nothing ever ended, nothing would have any value.

			I respectfully disagree. I don't think the song is about actual death in the first place, and even if it was - death is a fact of life. Sad maybe, but I don't think it should be ""depressing"" as such. I'm not in denial either. If nothing ever ended, nothing would have any value.			

an elegy to dead love, simple as that.  She's dead to him now and he's mourning not her, but the death of what had held them together.

It's been rumored that the 'dandelion' is Mariah's older sister Alison, who had problems with drug abuse, got pregnant at an early age, etc.  ""Valentine"" was Tommy Mottola's old stage name when he sang (YES, he did. ha ha I have no idea if he was good in any way).  The ""boy and girl"" are harder to figure out.

The song is about the fact that, although Mariah loves these people, the circumstances between them have made things difficult.

I think Mariah wrote this about all the issues in her life, from being a bi-racial child growing up, getting teased, her parents divorcing and her family being split apart...the part about the dandelion, i think that represents her growing up and losing her innocence, like most of us do. The ""patriarch"" is her marriage to tommy mottola, and i heard that the boy and girl in the song are really tommy's kids that he already had from a previous marriage. So she's saying that she grew close to them and loved them, but she had to leave because she..""fled to save my sanity"".  The best part in the song is the end..""and i missed alotta life, but i'll recover, though i know you really like to see me suffer, still i wish that you and i could forgive each other, cause i miss you valentine, and really loved you..."" I find this song so true and courageous of mariah, she took very personal things from her life and shared it with her fans and the world. I love all her music and find her to be one of the greatest artists ever.

I think that most of the comments above are right, I've read somewhere else that she talks about Tommy Mottola here, his children, and Mariah's sister.
This must be the song the most shockingly moving ever for me, because I used to listen to it all the time in such a painful situation that still lingers on. 
Back in 2000 I was having ""true"" friends for the first time (a little ""sis"" and a little ""brother""); and then suddenly felt abandoned by them, not only that but betrayed as well...the people I loved the most were somehow the ones that turned the knife inside of me.

""So many I considered 
Closest to me 
Turned on a dime and sold me 
Out dutifully 
Although that knife was chipping 
Away at me 
They turned their eyes away and 
Went home to sleep ... ""

They probably don't even know they hurt me so bad.
And then I also cried at the fact that it's been so long since I've been living a life deprived of so much things...I spent so many years doing little more than studying and getting caught up in the worries of becoming a lawyer, that I simply forget to live. And I've got so many regrets about the person I became later, and the people that I lost along the way, probably because of myself...
""And I missed a lot of life 
But l'II recover 
Though I know you really like 
To see me suffer 
Still I wish that you and I'd 
Forgive each other 
'Cause I miss you, Valentine 
And really loved you...""

Still, the only thing that drives me is the hope that one day I will recover...I will be the unspoiled person that I used to be...but who knows...
And how badly I wish I could forgive them, especially the one that mistreated me the most...and how I would like him to see that I always loved him, probably more than anyone else...I need to forgive to move on, and I desperately need to feel at peace with myself for once.

*I love Petals - thank you Mariah*

"
897,Prison Sex.json,"
Prison Sex is about child molestation and cycles of abuse. 

The creaking at the beginning of the song is meant to emulate a door being gently pushed open, creaking loud among the silence.

He hadn't picked up the name Maynard yet, that came later. He was James now. Probably was referred to as 'Jimmy' around this time. He was 11. His mom had her fateful aneurysm that left her broken down and paralyzed, forever changed, her faithful devotion intensified and led her to become more and more delusional and willfully ignorant. 

Jimmy's stepfather was caring for him at this time, he inspires the content for this song for about two years until Judith finally sends him to his fathers in Michigan.

The part that gets me is that the child molestation is only the first verse, the rest of the song is about him, the victim, becoming the perpetrator. What fucks my mind is that i cant decide whether of not this is a metaphor for him getting into sodomy as a result (4 degrees, stinkfist) or if he for real raped a dude. Or both.

In the live sessions of Prison Sex they add a set of lyrics right before the 'i have found some kind of temporary sanity..' climax, Here they are:

""Show me something (4x)
Thought I could make it end
Thought I could wash the stains away
Thought I could break the circle if I
Slipped right into your skin
So sweet was your surrender
We have become one
I have become my terror
And you my precious lamb and martyr""

I never quite understood the 'Lamb and Martyr' part until i heard/read this, and even so i hope its only just my interpretation. he's referring to a single person. If you can't see what im getting at maybe its best i don't spell it out..

Before playing 'Jimmy' live once, Maynard addressed the crowd, announcing it as the sequel to Prison sex. Jimmy being a very personal story, the announcement of it as a 'Sequel"" to Prison Sex is kind of shocking. That gives it a light of being a personal story, just by that strong association. H is a sister piece to Prison sex, its about him struggling with the abuse he grew up with, in the face of having a child of his own. The snake hissing was his lamb and martyr. That's a beautiful song about him realizing he doesnt have to perpetuate.

I have a deeper respect for Maynard than i ever have ever had for a singular artist, and the reason for that is songs like Prison sex, Jimmy, H, Judith, Passive, Orestes... he just completely opens himself up and turns his personal pain and sorrow into beautiful art as a means to move forward himself and as a tool for others to do so as well. ""Turn these leaden grudges into gold""

			I don't think it necessarily should be assumed the song is autobiographical, or that just because Maynard had thoughts of rape that he acted on them. I highly doubt he is a rapist, especially considering that he is a supporter of RAINN.

ok this song is for one about exactly what it sounds like - rape - but more importantly the psychology of a rapist.  now take it a step further i beleive he uses this example to get accross a broader point.  that point is that when horrible or traumatizing  things happen in our past especially childhood it has a certain affect on people.  one way some people deal with it is by inflicting pain on others  as an outlet.  ""you are my martyr my lamb"" means that you must suufer / be sacrificed for me to feel better or maybe to feel anything at all.  hands bound and head down obviously works as a rape visual but also as a symbol that he is a slave bound to repeat these horrors without controlle or so it seems.

@minty33 















From the most superficial standpoint, this is a gross song about being butt-raped in prison...not very appealing, so looking deeper's necessary. The following lines are the most important, I would say:

Do unto others what has been done to you 

Do unto you now what has been done to me 

I've come round full circle. 
(quoted from tool's official site's lyrics)

I think it's more about victims turning around and victimizing others.  At first they are violated, but with time they ""come around"" to their predator's ways, and violate others themselves.

This is not confined to sexual predation or just to prison.  In fact, it seems more like Maynard means to draw a parallel to other froms...religious ""recruiters"" seem a good example. 
preying on the weak and feeble-minded, they convert somebody to their faith, and they cannot defend against these people so because of weak-mindedness they go along, and ignorantly believe what they're told.
Now, they become the missionaries, and ignorantly follow orders to find ""recruits.""  They victimize other people based on how they were originally victimized.
(I'm not dogging all religious types now, just those who fit this example)

Even a child playing an online computer game can fit it.  Someone cheats , and he loses out, so he gets angry and starts cheating, ripping off other people.

The concept of this song relates to many many things, we ""come around full circle"" a lot, and adopt what is handed to us, whether by a malicious enemy, or by inadvertent ignorance.  So keep your third eye open and think about this one...

			It's not about ""being butt-raped in prison.""  It's about being molested as a child, then becoming a molester oneself.  ""Prison Sex"" is just a device to describe the feeling of molested/molester.  Choice is gone, your sex (or sexual deviancy) is your prison.

			Absolutely nothing to do with actual prisons as physical, geographic, architectural places.  Absolutely everything to do with being imprisoned in cycles of sexual molestation and abuse.

And I am the most fervent anti-religion zealot I know, a survivor of the fucking *mormons* for fucks sake, but the correlation with missionaries is a bit of a stretch.  They've got a dozen real faults sicker than any one you can dream up; if we stoop to fighting them on the basis of made-up 'facts' they have the home-court advantage.  By all means tear into the bastards, but you need to fight them with logic and sanity or you've already lost the battle.

All sorts of correlations can be dreamed up if you work at it (this is the first time I've seen the computer game theory, for instance) but given Maynard's own comments about the song and Tool's fearless lyrics & video it seems a bit cold and arrogant to just decide that whatever tenuous connection you can make to your own life is a valid interpretation... that's very postmodern and all I'm sure but very real people endure very real horrors and if Tool can so unflinchingly shine a little light into that darkness it seems profane to hijack that light with unthinking narcissism.

Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. And sometimes a big guy named Bubba will shove that cigar right into your ass, as you will then do to the next poor bloke who walks through those prison doors.

The meaning of the song is pretty simple, which makes it all the more horrify. Someone has been raped, and the only way they can find catharsis, the only way they can cope with the trauma, is by raping themselves. Considering this is how the cycle of abuse actually works it's pretty heavy.

@Ganondox 















Okay, I guess the way I see this song is a lot simpler.  To me it seems like Maynard is talking about a child who was sexually abused and then growing up and abusing their child in the same way because its all that they really knew of childhood and growing up.  
      ""Do unto you now what has been done to me""
In relation to the title of the song, the child's home became a prison because their abuser kept the child there, or if not that it could be seen as emotional imprisonment.
For me, seeing the video really made all of this come together, but that's just my interpretation, so who knows what Maynard was really thinking about this song.

I can't believe everyone is obsessed with sex so much...it's true, some (very few, in fact, of maynard's TOOL songs have to do with sex...many more of his apc have to do with sex) TOOL songs have to do with sex as a metaphor or as an abuse (prison sex), etc., but most of Maynard's songs have intellectual meaning, philisophical meanings, ideological meanings...as does pushit.  Pushit simply has to do with Maynard's internal struggle with his past and that of religion (Christian Baptist in particular).  The infant mentioned in the song is in part himself in his youth and representative of the infant Jesus Christ.  The ideas and values preached to a young Maynard really confused him because of the abusive relationship his stepfather (the one who was preaching) had with him.  He associates a harmless, loving, defenseless infant with himself as a child, but he still hates himself for letting that abuse happen...he wants to get away from himself and that time in his life.  The infant haunts him...it's an image that stays with him always, partly from what was preached to him.  It's an image that tells him to love those who have wronged him (forgive them), an image that dictates the way he SHOULD (whether the right way or the wrong way) live his life but that he can't face up to because it is just to painful.  Jesus was abused in some of the most wicked ways and yet, he forgave all those who maimed him.  Maynard disagrees with this at the time this song was written.  He holds THE GRUDGE and wheres it like a crown.

@rog27 You just made my day with your interpretation! thanks!!			

For me this song, as with many tool songs is about breaking patterns of negative, and often abusive behaviour - whether it be towards the self, another person, or on a social level.  It says that the capacity to damage is often unintentional but inevitable if you dont actively overcome the negative aspects of yourself, whatever the cause of those traits is.

Thus pushit may be interpreted as a relationship whereby two personalities bring the worst out of each other even though they are apparently inseperable, and dependent on one another.  The only way to end the pattern is for both to die and be reborn.

I love the multiple ways you can interpret this song. You can see it, shallowly, about sex, wade into the waters and say it's about a complicated relationship between two lovers, or, as I prefer, you can dive deeply and say it's about the relationship between two characters within one body. These characters are fighting for control. Not necessarily two personalities as if he is a schitzo, but more so that you can't decide who you are or want to be and you change for other people and distort who you are for them, and then finally deciding to take control in the end, even if sometimes you loved your ""alternate person"" that you were pretending to be.

			I've noticed a trend in Maynard to be able to see things from an immateria* plane of 
existence.  I really want to go with the notion that all of you are right in the different levels of understanding this song, everything from a relationship with a lover to a relationship with self or even, as mentioned above, a relationship with the all (DMT - experience).  

What I get from it is that this song is a direct relation with the notion of ""self"" and the relationship (regardless of what with) that affects the self.  Whether this play is acted out with a lover, an inward spiritual trip where one is talking to the multiplaned self or even just a relationship with a drug or more specifically, ANYTHING that affects you by becoming apart of who you are.  In that since, it's a surrender to the notion that these relationships are the foundation of what makes us human and alive.

*Yes, I'm referring to the one beautifully explained in Promethea.  Google if you've never read as it will help anyone understand the concepts of Magick, Crowley, and is a good starting guide into the paths of shamanic vision and how mythology and archetypes define people in a much truer since than we're taught in Western schooling.

Maynard himself said that this song is about identifying the cycle of abuse within yourself. The lyrics quite obviously show that. You may interpret the song in any way you wish, but the man himself already gave the meaning.

I hate when people say Maynard is a god.  This sounds so stupid coming from an actual Tool fan.  He is a human being just like you or I.  Of couse he IS in the greatest band in the world, and has gone through life experiences that make him a person the we can learn from.  Although sometimes I wonder about Tool's true meaning.  never-the-less, there is some value to be seen in Tool songs, but not so much that we should follow him blindly!

Never been a fan of conceptual art until TooL came around... Persons translate deep songs like Pushit the way it suits them, and everyone will find 'the right meaning' and 'the right way to interprete' lyrics in the right way to fit into his/her own mental 'device', due to their own preconceptions, frustrations, meanings etc.
For me, personally, this song has been the best introduction to the methods of Jung's theory of 'Reflective Cycology' :-)... which refers to 'phenomenom' of projecting your own virtues and lacks onto another person, making him/her reflection of yourself - just like Jesus said about 'thorn in someone's eye becomes a stick in your own eye' (or something like that, I'm sorry for this paraphrase). What it means is that what might bother you with one person is actually something that you might bother another person with.
...like someone pointed previously about the inner struggle over/against oneself, I thought for Maynard that he addressed this song to himself : 'who am I to judge and strike you down' refers to what I previously wrote on Jung's theory... The thing is that I was the one addressing this song to myself, and if I hadn't learned important lesson on this projecting onto other persons, I quess I would become schyzophrenic, to say at least. ;-)
Seriously, TooL did one hell of a job here and I'm glad that I really don't know what this song means for them... However, I recommend you all to find more on Jung, because I'm too lazy to write down here all the concepts on above mentioned, and it might be useful to someone who might, instead, post something originally on this topic.

@Mr.TreeUpsidedown 















What we should all realize off the bat is that there were 2 different 'released' versions of this song.  In the live version (Salival) Maynard comments at the beginning of the track that they're going to play it differently because it means something new to them and that they want the energy of the crowd to help propel the interpretation along.

The original song (Aenima) can be interpreted many ways.  Yes, I agree (sometimes against my will), that it could be about anything from abuse (including self) to relationships, religion, health, etc.  I believe the song itself was crafted in such a personal and hidden way that we could all generalize until we're blue but never really touch the source of this incredible track.

The live version, however, is a different story (in my opinion).  Thank you F00L for transcribing this version for us (above).

Allow me to be slightly long-winded due to the depth of the ideas I'm trying to express... hopefully you won't just scroll down to add your own opinion in haste.

With Maynard's declaration that they were ""trying to see this song from a different angle and under a different light"", it should be obvious that there was a breakthrough in regards to how they felt about this song in the few years they were touring after they had recorded and pressed it.  

I guess, given the array of ""mental states"" or ""frames of mind"" (no, I'm not talking about drugs) you can be in on a tour, where you are playing similar set lists every night, it's inevitable that the songs that you have written from your deepest and/or darkest places will start to take new meaning.  Indeed, even the greatest artist will find new inspiration in his old work. (I think I'll coin that!)

With his plea to have the crowd grant him their collective feeling of vulnerability, I believe he had a very direct and essential message for all of us.  No, I am not saying that ""Maynard is God"" or a prophet, but I believe that if there were a band out there that could speak to that which is within us… below the surface… it is Tool.   

Thus, I think Maynard really gave us a glimpse into our struggle.  I also believe he said it in the simplest way possible.  For those of you that are not familiar with the evolution of the body, mind and spirit, you should check out some Buddhist literature. Try ‘The Tibetan book of Living and Dying’ – Sogyal Rinpoche… (best source I can give while in the moment).

I believe that this song (the live version) was written entirely about the evolution of the mind.  A lot of people have touched on topics of God in this forum, but I don't believe it's ‘God’ that he's speaking of/to... instead, it's his ‘higher self’.  There's a bit of gray between the 2 concepts that can cause confusion.

If you listen to this song as a message to his ‘higher self’ as it tries to pull him through to ""enlightenment"", or simply our next stage of growth, it makes a whole lot of serious sense.

I don't know how many of you have a voice in your head that you know is your own but can't grasp how it actually sounds?  The one that speaks the words as you read to yourself, the one that you turn to when you're unsure... that little angel of good advice that you don't always take....

I believe, as is not uncommon in spiritual circles across the world, that this is our very outlet to the divine.  Or brief reflection of ourselves in a higher consciousness.

I believe that his song is a very direct and very focused spotlight on the struggle between the ‘Higher Self’ and the Ego (see Freud or any Buddhist literature for dynamic ideas on the function/identification of the notion).

The Ego itself is the dominant mental structure in our every-day lives.  The Buddhists say that it's the veil in which covers the line between the corporeal and the enlightened.  It's that which blinds us and tricks us into remaining in this evolutionary state until we literally hatch from the egg.  The Ego is our egg shell, that which protects us at a very basic level and allows us to grow without the pressures and mind-blowing intensity that is ‘God’.  

Even though the Ego tends to hold some people back (those who grow very quickly inside the shell) it is completely essential in our evolution... as important as the brain, the heart and the lungs.  

As much as it is necessary, it is also very tricky.  It has the ability to fool all of the senses, to shut you down if it needs to... to direct your train of thought as you drift away.  We give full control of ourselves to this innate consciousness and handfuls of us come to realize it entirely.  

When we start to wake up, it's terrifying... like being pushed from the womb.  We are about to undertake reality-shattering events that will re-construct everything we thought we knew.  

In order to cross through to the next layer of reality/consciousness, we have to be able to leave the womb behind... and that is one of the hardest things a human being can be asked to do.  Just look at how we react as babies when we are born and how we deal with the world as we learn and grow.  Life a we know it isn’t always the easiest place to exist.

The fact of the matter is that we can't stay in the shell forever, regardless of how comfortable or familiar it becomes.  The shell (Ego) will ultimately become too small or narrow for our expanding mental/spiritual capacity as humans.  

We have to come to terms with the idea and ease ourselves through the passing, as not to cause ourselves any more shock than necessary.  When I hear this song and I think this way, it makes me realize that “all of this pain really is an illusion”... that we should embrace our evolution and start to 'question authority' (ego) regardless of how often this authority attempts to trick us into staying.  It is just our reflection.

As you can tell, I'm very passionate about this song and the truth that rings through me every time I hear it.  Hopefully there's at least one other person out there that shares the same perspective.  If not, sorry for wasting your time.

The Yin Yang sums up these lyrics pretty well. Polarity, duality, energies combing to become greater than the sum of their parts or canceling each other out, always containing some part of the other within themselves. Light and dark, self and other, being and non-being, male and female, or even just two people in a relationship regardless of gender. It's the magnetic push-pull phenomenon. This can be applied to many spectrums/polarities and interpreted in many different ways.

It is a song a bout Fear.

Conquering ones fear is like pushing it onto one self. 

There is no greater feeling than conquering ones fear.

Survival is my only friend. Terrified of what may come.

Remember I will always love you, as I claw your fucking throat away.

It will end no other way.

Fear is the only emotion that you can eliminate with destruction

Conquer fear and you can conquer anything.

This is an old italian song by Tony Renis. The original text is:

Dimmi quando tu verrai
dimmi quando... quando... quando...
l'anno, il giorno e l'ora in cui
forse tu mi bacerai...

Ogni istante attenderò,
fino a quando... quando... quando...
d'improvviso ti vedrò
sorridente accanto a me!

Se vuoi dirmi di sì
devi dirlo perché
non ha senso per me
la mia vita senza te...

Dimmi quando tu verrai,

""Non ci lasceremo mai!""

For me and my relationship, this song has a lot of meaning.

My husband and I are currently separated but working on things, trying to make it work.  For me, this song is about losing who you are in a relationship and putting up walls.  But as time goes on, you realize you have to let those walls go and be ready and willing to love again.  
This verse says a lot about the person who feels like they lost themselves
""Just when you think that love will never find you
You run away but still it's right behind you, oh
It's just something that we can't control""
The person who is still there, loving the person who left...you run away but still it's right behind you.

I dont know. Maybe I am way off base here but it make sense to me given my current situation.

Cheers to Bentol and others:

No one mentioned that ""Red Right Hand"" is from
John Milton's ""Paradise Lost"".

This is even spelled out on another Nick Cave album ""Murder ballads"" in ""Song of Joy"":

""
Quotes John Milton on the walls in the victim's blood.
Police are investigating at tremendous cost.
In my house he wrote 'His red right hand' ""
That I am told, is from 'Paradise Lost'
""

Milton wrote:
""
Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse.
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires,
Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,
And plunge us in the flames; or from above
Should intermitted vengeance arm again
His red right hand to plague us? What if all
Her stores were opened, and this firmament
Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire,
Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall 
""

You can see the obvious allure for our pal Nick.  All that old trestament wrathful divinity that fills much of his poetry.

The beauty of art is it's ability to become what the viewer sees or even wishes to see.  For my money, though, the tall, handsome man in this song might be the brutal God of the Christian tales, indiffrent to man's sense of self-destruction.

Cave is one fo my favourite poets who happens to be an excellent musician.

Milton got it from some ode by Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus), where it referred to the hand of Jupiter, the king of the Roman pantheon.

The character in the song does seem more like the Roman god than the Christian one.

I always wondered if Nick Cave is a Stephwn King fan, because this song is a perfect description of Randall Flagg in The Stand. Everything about it is so perfect for that character, especially the lines 'On the gathering storm comes a tal handsome man in a dusty black coat with a red right hand.'

			That was my exact thought when listening to the song carefully today. The references are clearly and explicitly to Paradise Lost, demon / evil god, but the presentation seems so close to Randall Flag that I have to wonder if that's part of it, with King's own ambiguity about Flagg's identity.

red right hand means he has killed people. red as in blood. I think they are talking about a government man. A shady unknown man that has done bad things involved with the government, such as war, illegal testing, corruption, and such. they are talking about uncle sam / the government. / the unknown and faceless government agent.

he will comfort you, that can represent the way they may give you a job and say you are protecting people, and it is in the interest of the nation, while in reality you are doing shady things. stacks of green paper in his red right hand, well that's obvious, the government has money to spend, and they have power and are corrupt.

this song was used in the x files tv series. In the show, they show shady government figures, like the cigarette smoking man, skinner, and others, that are involved with corrupt plots and cover ups. Some of them are murderers, aka ""red right hand"" (in my opinion, I think that is what the show and song is driving at)

""black coat"" = government agent

my opinion is that it has nothing to do with the devil, that's just my opinion.

there are lots of different opinions about this song, but this is what came into my mind when I heard it. great song by the way. (I like the music, not the lyrics)

""you are one microscopic cog in his plan"" = one small agent, amidst a vast network,, a large machine., one cog in a big machine.

""take me to the town, and go across the tracks.... "" = see? its anytown usa, it can happen anywhere. They can find you, any place, any where... no secret is safe.

Bentol's on to something -- between the Paradise Lost and the trinity references, God is a good call. One of my two favourite theories for this song.

Going with the god-theory: Rather than actual god, I think ol' Nick's describing the -idea- of god, drawn from the prayers of the wretched of a modern capitalist society. Divinity is meaningless, mercy and salvation are meaningless. All that matters is what you can get out of it, and so it doesn't matter who you're talking to (the 'ghost, god, man, guru' -bit). This is also why the description is so horriffic -- this is God as a dealer, the kind of guy who treats his congregation as customers. Pay your dues (in faith) and you'll get your fix of good stuff, don't and your life will be hell because always you'll be haunted by what you may ahve missed.

My problem with that theory is that it leaves the first verse (all that modern industrialist imagery) completely hanging. That's why I'd suggest a second identity for the man with the hand. On the one hand, it's the vindictive dealer image of God that runs through American politics. On the other, it's secular government as a controlling, identity-stealing and individualism-crushing force. That's what the lyric seems to be saying to me: ""Big Brother is watching, he knows all about you, he's everywhere, and this is -his- world. Conform to what we want you to want, or be ground down.""

Scary eh? Thats neat. When I read the lyrics my first idea was a description of satan or a satanic figure, but when i actually listen to the song i get no such images of anything scare or demonic like that. Rather i get a picture of a person the kind who's status as hero or criminal is widely debated. Someone to be deeply respected and yet wanted dead by others. Someone with a shady background and the capability to be your worst nightmare or your best friend and asset. Meh.. just the imagery i get.

@squeegie^weegie 















i think john andrew philot is more or less right except that his explanation is about as cryptic as the song.
the man with the red right hand is a broad metaphor for something/someone which can make you feel better but not actually make you better. perhaps something which tricks your body or your mind into feeling more at ease, drugs for example or perhaps a fashion label. things you have been convinced to like by other people and those people (the ones with the red right hands) make ""stacks of green paper"" out of your addiction.

i really hope thats true about this whole song being adlibbed but i doubt it.

			This still holds up as the most elegant interpretation.  There are many obvious ways it's representing Satan.  There's some great lyrical support for the Holy Trinity and big corporations and media as well (described in many other comments).

The binding thread is things which can be subverted into self-destructive bargains in which someone wins and it's not you.

For a comparison (much less creepy and dramatic, but a similar theme), check out TMBG's 'Spiraling Shape' which has a surface reading of drugs instead of the Devil, but a similar deep reading that this kind of mistake could be prompted by anything.

en.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost/…

According to Wikipedia the action of books I-II amongst other things centres around ""a debate [between the rebels] on what to do next in relation to the war in Heaven.""  The extract is spoken by Belial, who has been symbolic of many differing qualities throughout history.  However, in Book I of Paradise Lost he is represented as:

Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
Vice for itself. To him no temple stood
Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he
In temples and at altars, when the priest
Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled
With lust and violence the house of God?
In courts and palaces he also reigns,
And in luxurious cities, where the noise
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,
And injury and outrage; and, when night
Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night
In Gibeah, when the hospitable door
Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.

On th' other side up rose
Belial, in act more graceful and humane.
A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed
For dignity composed, and high exploit.
But all was false and hollow; though his tongue
Dropped manna, and could make the worse appear
The better reason, to perplex and dash
Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low—
To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds
Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear,
And with persuasive accent thus began:—

en.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost/…

So Belial in the extract that Nick cave refers to in his song Red Right Hand is attempting to persuade atan that the rebellion against God and the war in heaven is lost and to give up the fight.  It is interesting to note that the phrase ""Red Right Hand"" refers to God and the fear of God's retaliation and not Satan or a lesser demon of hell, which isn't suprising since in religous terms right hand path denotes judeo-christian beliefs and left hand path alternative/satanist views.

Now how does Nick cave use the phrase ""Red Right Hand"" in his song and what is he implying?

Firstly, you have to decide weather the figure represents Christianity or the Devil.  The song is quite ambigous and could be interpreted either way.

savage suggested this song was about an evangelist and these lines certainly support that argument:

He'll wrap you in his arms,
tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all the dreams

as Awwsugar pointed out these lines reflect the paradoxical nature of the trinity of god:

He's a god, he's a man,
he's a ghost, he's a guru

Could it be that the Guru along with the Evangelical aspects of the song is Nick's suspected form of the second coming of Christ?

Anyway I've spent enough time beating around the bush, I agree with the whole idea of Red Right Hand being a retelling of Faust but would add that the figure in the song is distinctly Christian and possibly a manifestation of God. 

I juat wanted to end by saying that the interpretations that you guys offer are really fascinating and to keep up the good work.  However, I doubt Nick Cave reads Stephen King.  He tends to 
like the deeper, philosophical artists not the paperback novellists but you never know....

I doubt that this song was entirely ad-libbed, or even partly ad-libbed.  it was probably well-thought out and written well before recording.

Also, ever noticed how Nick cave likes his serial killers, murderers and anti-heroes to be handsome and sexually alluring?

I've read through all of these and have only found one member (John Andrew Philpot) who makes mention of what i think is a well crafted metaphore for drugs and addiction.

Take the verse
Here he comes..
Through the ghettos and the barrio
and the bowery and the slum
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his
red right hand


This, to me anyway, points to nothing other than drugs. Coming in through the poorer sections of a city and leaving it's shadow cast on every where it's presence is known. Then, of course, the stacks of money piling up in it's red right hand.

Also, the last verse in the song can explain to anyone who's dealt the addiction (and maybe hasn't) the extent that it can overwhelm every 

It's debatable, i know - but Nick's own struggles with addiction put this meaning over the top for me. Also, suggesting that the song is taken at face value as being about some evil, possibly supernatural devil-like figure belies the masterful song writer that is Nick Cave. Would he simply write some scary little tune about a Randal Flagg type persona? i don't believe it's in his character - particularly not on an album that isn't, say ""Murder Ballads.""

Great article on Cave here:

themonthly.com.au/…

exert: ""... A “Manichean divide”, as the novelist Will Self has said, runs like an embattled frontier throughout Cave’s mental universe. In ‘Song of Joy’, he quotes Milton’s Satan, who in Paradise Lost refers to the “red right hand” of a jealous, vengeful God. In Milton’s poem the hand is red because it blazes with fiery potency; in Cave’s song it belongs to a murderer who has scrawled the citation in his victim’s blood...""

This is a really incredible Tool song ! I was fortunate enough to see it performed live. It's a really beautiful and opitmistic song. This song has a commom message among Tool songs: pushing limits and excuse the term, ""maximizing human potential"". An incredible line is that we are ""capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable."" I find that to be true but there are obstacles in the way. And in the beginning of the song, Maynard sounds as if he's just about to give up. Instead of ""pushing the envelope"",  he's happy with a self-indulgent, pitiful existence. This song has a lot of similarities to Lateralus. Although Maynard never gives you the exact details, ""there is so much more that beckons us"" and if we can't figure that out, then we can ""find peace within the emptiness"".

This is my favorite Tool song.  Anyone who says it has no mystical meaning or intention has not plunged into the depths of meditation.  The Buddha himself would be proud of this song, as it reflects the dharma of Buddhism and Hinduism.  The entire album is about transcendence and this is the climax:  Enlightenment
I have come curiously close to the end, down
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole,
Defeated, I concede and
Move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful.  …it’s calling me.
This is the dark night of the soul.  A deep depression every spiritual seeker goes through.  Eventually we all get to this point where the suffering is so tremendous we start looking for a way to end it.  It is like the divine is calling you to find it.
And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret - my confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
The moon is a common theme for spiritual teachers.  The dharma is just a finger pointing to the moon.  You grasp at the finger (the teacher or teaching), when it’s as simple as looking at the moon (absolute reality).  In these lyrics, there is an understanding in the subject that the moon’s light is not its own, it is only an illusion; Maya.
Its source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting
Obviously, the source of light is the sun.  In the allegory of the cave, Socrates uses the Sun to represent pure goodness which is in all of us. It is our divine nature.  We are all that.  We just don’t know it.  The ascent up causes a disorienting blur of the senses and eventually your union with permanent bliss.  If we can remember this, we will never suffer again.

And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt
Don't wanna be down here feeding my narcissism.
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out
Before I pine away.
To attain the selfless state, one must kill the ego.  The Buddha taught this constantly, using the word atman which can be used to mean transcendent Self or ego self.  The ego is the illusion of who you think you are.  Enlightenment is the complete destruction of this view.  The light of the transcendent self will lift you out.  Only you can help you.
So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
To leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical,
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable.
Just let the light touch you
And let the words spill through
And let them pass right through
Bringing out our hope and reason ...
before we pine away.
The best lines of the song, the subject realizes truth and the endless possibilities of life.  We are all literally one mind capable of all that’s imagined and conceivable.  Now he is free and genuinely qualifies as a human being pouring out love and compassion into the world.  He is telling you to let this love (light from the sun) pour and spill through you before you pine away, endlessly longing for something better.

The first time I ever really listened to this song was when I was in Washington state, on the beach at night and the moon was absolutely full and perfect. The light from the moon was reflection off of the ocean and this song was playing and it just gave me goosebumps. I was coming out of a very shitty relationship and felt very lost. This song on that night really pulled me through, and it's something I will never forget. So no, I don't have an analysis of what the song may truly mean, but I know exactly what it means to me, and I think in some way that is the point of any song, to find out what I means personally to you.

I think that the ego is often outdated for the common person in day to day life in this modern society.
We are born with the ego for survival, but in todays society, physical survival is quite simple, and the ego often gets in the way. I believe this song implies that to advance, to further develop and evolve, we must crucify the ego.
Imagine someone who lets their ego get he best of them, then imagine an incident involving that person if they simply put away with their ego, and it is easy to see how the song is significant.

This song is about slowly drifting into depression because it feels more comfortable than facing your fears and risking failure when you don't have much to offer.  As he starts slipping, the guy rationalizes that the reason he can't be happy is that he is better than everyone else--that he's above them, so he's much better off alone in his own pitiful hole.

As he's tripping on his self-pity, he's made aware that the moon(his confidant), the brightest, fullest body in the night sky, is simply reflecting the light of other bodies.  Even though the moon provides light to everyone, she has no light of her own.  At that moment, the guy realizes that he doesn't need anything great built-in to himself in order to be full and bright, he just needs to reflect the light of others.  As he lifts himself out of his hole, he immediately realizes that the comfort he felt from his seclusion and loneliness was far worse than the relief he feels out in the open.  Even though it feels comforting to be depressed and accepting of your own sad fate, the relief that you get from rejecting it and rising above it feels much better.

The key here is that the moon was reflecting light, not absorbing it.  Even though she was better off than the guy in the song, she took notice and projected her (borrowed)light to get him out of his hole.  The rest of the song is about living by others for others.  You can't produce anything within yourself to make yourself happy, so you have to share the happiness of others.  You have to crucify your ego and make an effort to reflect light onto others.  The message is basically to follow the Golden Rule.

Simply on a personal note, I first listenedn any drugs.  And I don't claim they are the ""key"" to understanding the song, or even that it has any relation to this before I'd ever take to drugs whatsoever.  However, I thought I understood it, more or less, but really didn't exactly connect with it.  After my first encounter with psychedelic mushrooms, I listened to it again and it was like I'd literally transformed my interpretation of this song.  Again, I know it probably isn't the same for everybody, but on a personal level I do feel I understand the song a lot better than ever before.

My Interpretation:
I see a man who has come to realize he's disgusted with the person he's become.  He fears it's too late to turn away, he's gone too far, and perhaps he should simply embrace it (the ego, or ""self-indulgent pitiful hole"").  Then, in the pit of his disgrace, he has an epiphany.  The moon, as ""full and bright"" as it is, cannot and does not rely on its own self to be at its ""maximum,"" as it were.  It seeks the light from the ""sun,"" an endless source of energy and life (for this planet, at least).  Just like it, the man should seek guidance, recognize his own imperfections, and accept help from a ""higher order"" (be it reason, religion, spirituality, anything), in order to be truly whole or happy, or reach a sort of enlightenment.  But when you just accept yourself as you are, you're no better than the moon without the sun, just a ""lifeless satellite""

The man understands, he wants to change what he's become, he doesn't need to sit and simply suffer his 'narcissistic' existence anymore - he wants to be alive.  Now that he truly believes he can be saved from himself, he turns to the audience and gives his sort of testimony and call to action.  He cries out that we join him in a search for truth, to cast our our pitiful judgements of one another, to want something more than simply what we've come to understand in this world.  It's not some contract, X number of years on earth for some heaven after death; rather, it's a promise for a happy life in the now.  This world offers so much more than many have witnessed, and he begs we not spare ourselves its beauty and a chance to see beyond our ego.  Our lives are a journey and there's only so many steps we can take before ""we pine away,"" so don't take it for granted.

I don't claim any superior knowledge over anyone who has or hasn't taken any drugs, meditated, gone through life changing experiences, nor is it my intention to give off that tone.  That's what I hear when I listen to this song, and I'm sure I'm not alone. :)

This is sort of a long analysis, and without an understanding of the concept of the entire Lateralus album, it doesn't make as much sense, but I'll try my best:

First of all, there's a reason it fits so well with Disposition and Triad. They all tell the same story. Disposition is sort of the beginning of the mind or the soul (I guess you could say the childhood), where you don't have as much experience or knowledge about the world, and you go entirely off of what you're taught. Your knowledge of the world depends on your *disposition* to it, and as such what people ""mention [...] to [you]"" causes the ""weather [to] change"". Reflection, then, is sort of the maturing of the soul, the adulthood if you will, where you begin to *reflect* on your experience. Triad, although being purely instrumental, closes off the trilogy well. I'll likely explain that on Triad's respective page.

Now for a bit of a part-by-part analysis of Reflection:

""I have come curiously close to the end, down
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole, defeated I
Concede and (Concede and) move closer (Move closer), I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness, how pitiful

It's calling me (Calling me)
etc...""

The narrator lives in a self-indulgent, selfish lifestyle. He focuses his life on his own benefit, not on his moral or spiritual gain. He considers it a pitiful lifestyle, but he refuses to do anything about it, instead feeling defeated by it, and tries to find his happiness in what he has, rather than doing something to create his happiness by improving his life.

""And in my darkest moment, fetal and weepin'
The moon tells me a secret, my confidant
As full and bright as I am, this light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me""

As the narrator is slipping down this path and losing himself, the moon (a common symbol of the spirit or spirituality) shares with him the secret of a proper life. It being ""full and bright"" means that it is pure and whole. And the reflections symbolise the knowledge and the awakening which he is receiving.

""It's source is bright and endless, she resuscitates the hopeless
Without her we are lifeless satellites dreamin' dreams
And as I pull my head out, I am without one doubt, don't want to be down here soothing my narcissism, I
Must crucify the ego before it's far too late, I pray the light lifts me out

Before I pine away
etc.""

The moon is full of wisdom because it is truly complete and never-ending. It gives him hope and allows him to change, something he thought himself incapable of her, and now he believes himself indebted to her. And when he starts to truly see things, or ""pull his head out"" of his pitiful state, he realises that he no longer wants to be a part of such a selfish world, and wants to be a part of something bigger, which requires him to rid himself of his ego (often also referred to as the self) to become a part of something bigger, before it's far too late to change.

""So crucify the ego before it's far too late to leave behind this place, so negative and blind and cynical
And you will come to find that we are all one mind, capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable
Just let the light touch you and let the words spill through, just let them pass right through, bringin' out our hope and reason

Before we pine away
etc.""

And now he shares his realisation with the listener. He realises that we all must rid ourselves of our no-longer-necessary egos to become a part of something truly great, where all people are one. We are all the same person in different bodies. And if we see ourselves as that and unite, we're capable of everything, but rather because we remain selfish and refuse to listen to reason, we remain negative and blind and achieve very little. So he says that we must all accept this (""let the light touch you"") and then share it with others to get them to see (""let the words spill though, just let them pass right through"") until we can awaken the whole world to the true hope in the world, before we all destroy ourselves.


This song very much draws on the concepts explained in Lateralus, Parabol/Parabola, and to some extent, Schism, The Patient, and The Grudge. I'd suggest looking into the whole album.

Also, has anyone noticed that the intro to this song (when split into sections based on the introduction of instruments) is nearly the same when you play it backwards? I haven't yet found any meaning to this, other than the connection to the title.

			Also, another comment I have to make. A lot of people on this forum, I've noticed, seem to believe that the ""ego death"" is a product solely of DMT (which Tool has been known to use). A similar sort of state (or what I assume to be similar, having never used or studied DMT) can be achieved through years of practice with deep meditation. A state of true unification with the world, where the self is truly destroyed and the person becomes one with the universe. I have experienced that myself. Although when the person returns from meditation, they return to their normal state, and the ego returns with them, the memory of that form sticks forever.

I duuno what HE meant by it but it kinda seems to me that he's saying if you're all wrapped up in self-pity and sadness, mabe it's time to just contemplate your position in the entirety of the human condition and just be glad to just BE.

Something I think people are missing - the idea of thinking ""about the end way too much"" and ""it's fun to fantasize"" - I think some people are missing what that means. That is suicidal thinking. I'm seeing a counselor now about this. When you think about death, you are fantasizing about leaving this stressful world and going somewhere with no worries, a place of rest. (This is particularly true if you believe in an afterlife.) And like I said earlier, in this song, ToP is saying that the way to stay alive is to let go of that need to control - particularly that need to control the end of your life - let go of it and give control to a higher power. Don't hurry toward death -- TAKE YOUR TIME. Let God do the controlling and just RIDE in the passenger seat. You're fallen. And you're continuing to fall. So just drop into God's arms, sit back, let God drive, and enjoy the ride.

I am an atheist and also in counseling. I would have thought the opposite made more sense. If someone believes in an afterlife, presumably they would at least consider the possibility that suicide could  lead to hell or some other kind of after-life punishment. Whereas, someone who doesn't believe in an afterlife likely sees an end to their pain, without obvious personal consequences.

@dan1876588 Well, when I mentioned afterlife, I was referring to the words before it: ""going to a place of rest."" My point was that ""going"" somewhere would be a more prevalent thought if you actually believe there's somewhere to go. Didn't mean suicidal thoughts are more prevalent if you believe in an afterlife.

I agree with everything you said. The suicide/hell/punishment connection is widely believed (even though it's not biblical nor espoused by modern theologians). But I think there's also a connection between faith and meaning — that a belief in a higher power usually leads to purpose. It's certainly something twenty one pilots explores in their songs. I know that my own exploration of apologetics and theology has opened my eyes to the possibility of a much greater purpose, giving my life new meaning and purpose and combatting my own suicidal thoughts. I wear a leather cuff with the word ""faith"" on it over the place where I'm tempted to cut my wrist — a reminder that there just might be something bigger and more meaningful than me, and a reason I'm still here, and that faith in that ""bigger"" God will get me through each day. 

I think we each need to find meaning. (That, again, is a common theme in twenty one pilots songs.) I hope you're able to find meaning in your life as well.

-""I know that my own exploration of apologetics and theology has opened my eyes to the possibility of a much greater purpose, giving my life new meaning and purpose and combatting my own suicidal thoughts.""-  1. Have you ever looked at the criticisms of apologetics? I recommend Steve Shives and his 'an Atheist reads' series (he goes through in considerable detail individual apologetics books and attempts analyse them with an open mind). 2. You believe in a God that allows ""Every minute a person attempts suicide; every day 70 Americans take their own lives (nearly three every hour)."" You understand how difficult depression is and yet you believe God inflicts/ or allows you to suffer depression? If that's not bad enough your God allows ""Approximately 3.1 million children die from hunger each year."" Surely, logically, if God exists he/she does not give a shit about you?

""I think we each need to find meaning. (That, again, is a common theme in twenty one pilots songs.) I hope you're able to find meaning in your life as well."" I really appreciate that but I hope to find that meaning from my friends and family not being that almost certainly does not give a damn about me or even exist. I wish you the best in the daily struggle, that is life.

I recommend Steve Shives and his 'an Atheist reads' series (he goes through in considerable detail individual apologetics books and attempts analyse them with an open mind). 2. You believe in a God that allows ""Every minute a person attempts suicide; every day 70 Americans take their own lives (nearly three every hour)."" You understand how difficult depression is and yet you believe God inflicts/ or allows you to suffer depression? If that's not bad enough your God allows ""Approximately 3.1 million children die from hunger each year."" Surely, logically, if God exists he/she does not give a shit about you?

""I think we each need to find meaning. (That, again, is a common theme in twenty one pilots songs.) I hope you're able to find meaning in your life as well."" I really appreciate that but I hope to find that meaning from my friends and family not being that almost certainly does not give a damn about me or even exist. I wish you the best in the daily struggle, that is life.			

I absolutely adore this song it's gotta be my favourite they've ever written.
As for the meaning, short version I think it's literally just struggling to make it through life, wanting to leave and so you've just gotta enjoy each moment as it comes. Struggling, but enjoying the ride

When I first heard this song, I was only really listening to the music and never realized how dark the lyrics are. ""I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride"", ""I think about the end just way too much, but it's fun to fantasize""... i think this song is about blunt acceptance of degradation. I also think the topic is legit! Sometimes you struggle so hard with one concept (life) that you never realize you can just let go, and I think this was about letting go. During the rap I think this is further proved. ""I'd take a bullet for everyone in this room"", a promise that builds yourself up, but that's a ton of weight to carry. You can't keep going with the weight of empty words, promises, personas. This is about letting go, and seeing whats happening to you, evermore accepting it. You can decide for yourself wither this is positive or negative, but I love this song a lot. I like how hard their song's make me think, and I like how controversial they are, but my vote on this one is letting go, and having to accept that, as well as preparing to hit rock bottom by celebrating while you still can.

I love the rap in this one. Tyler often just puts out a small rant on a given subject that seems to bother him or be on his mind like this one. He kinda just talks about walking the walk and how so many people are just all about the talk.
""'I'd die for you', that's easy to say...but I don't seem to see many bullets coming through""
It's easy to say that we'll be there through thick and thin when things are good. How many times do people say things of such intensity that are clearly not something they'd likely ever have to prove?
He then makes it more personal by saying ""'I'd live for you', and that's harder to do"". How is that more personal? Because he suffers from depression. For someone who wants to die it's a more powerful and legitimate promise to stay alive for someone instead of selfishly ""dying for someone"" and taking the easy way out.
At the end he then of course drops those intense rhetorical questions of ""who would you live for?
Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?""
Of course he doesn't meant literally kill, but instead more along the lines of making one of these extreme promises to someone just to eventually fail them, or ""kill"" them.
Some of the most impactful lyrics by Tyler and something that has really made me stop and think.

@danielson8501 















This song plays with the images of light and dark (both in the first verse's lyrics and in the video) - this is a theme that runs through much of the Blurryface album & many of the band's videos. In Ride's first verse, Tyler sings of wanting to stay in the light of the sun. This has a double (even maybe triple) meaning -- staying in the light refers to staying away from dark/depressive/suicidal thoughts, but it also refers to staying in the light of God's love -- both of which are ""hard sometimes"" to do. (And since the band's members are Christians, ""sun"" is likely a thinly veiled metaphor for ""Son,"" because a follower of Jesus seeks to ""stay in the Son"" and seeks ""Son's peace of mind""). The second verse plays with biblical teachings regarding laying down your life for your brothers, loving your enemies, loving others more than yourself, etc. Regarding the chorus, I believe there are two key things to understand about this song: ""Ride"" refers to letting go of control of your life and letting someone else do the ""driving."" And ""falling"" refers to both the fall toward death and the biblical fall of man -- our fall away from God. I think the band is saying that letting go of control and turning it over to a higher power (basically, the first step on a 12-step program) allows an individual to trust and love and enjoy the ""ride"" of life. But it's ""hard sometimes"" to stay in that place, particularly when you ""think too much."" I believe Tyler sings ""help me"" both to God and to his friends and fans, because his music is where he's able to really let go and enjoy the ""ride."" (The video re-emphasizes this idea, as the band struggles to stay in the light but, once they are able to ""polarize"" and focus on a higher power - represented by sunglasses - they are able to stay in the light via their music.)

@Moonbeam86 















I feel like the songs is a deep look at the human minds ability of escapism and depression. The way we escape from reality and the spiral of thought it can take us down. Life ""is hard sometimes"" so to escape we fantasize. In following this distraction we get lost in your own thoghts, ""taking a ride"" if you will. Eventually this road leads your mind to realize ""I've been thinking to much"", the fantasy ends the depression sinks in again. The ride ends leaving you to left ot ask ""Help Me"".

@jonjonwinny 















So I'm gonna add my own interpretation because I've never seen it explained.

For me the song is partly about their fame.
To understand that you have to have the video in mind.

""I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes""

Here the sun would represent their fame, their success, they're in the light of the public now. And their success gives Tyler some peace of mind, because that was the goal, to be listened to, to make shows. But it's hard sometimes because typically, Tyler (or Josh I think) wouldn't be the kind of person comfortable with fame. Doing interviews and explaining deep and personal song lyrics is not his most comfortable place to be. 


""Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize""

Here it could have a double meaning. The first one being related to suicidal thoughts, thinking about death, fantasizing about it when it sees as a freeing, a relief. 
But it could also mean the end of fame, which could also be a relief for someone like Tyler because fame also means being inspected, judged. 



""Oh, oh
I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride""

Tyler think they just have a ride to success, that all of this will fall down anyways so he enjoys while it lasts.
In the video, they're in the dark until the second ""ride"" when the light of the sun suddenly appear and you can see in te video how the light dazzle them, as it being annoying and forbidding them to properly see. That's duality of fame being represented, they're shown in the lights but it keeps them from seeing what's in front of them.


""I'd die for you
That's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them
A bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through""

Here it's about how everyone talks about self sacrifice but we rarely have the occasion to prove that we would do it. ""Everyone in this room"" makes me think of a concert. How Tyler would sacrifices for the fans if needed. He wants to have this feeling, that he would do it. But you never know until it happens.


""Metaphorically I'm the man
But literally I don't know what I'd do""

Here explained more clearly, Tyler's the man because he's the one fans look up too, and he wants to be able to handle the task, but if we speak literally, real bullets, real death, he's not sure if he could.


""I'd live for you
And that's hard to do
Even harder to say
When you know it's not true
Even harder to write
When you know that tonight
There are people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignored them still
All these questions they're for real
Like Who would you live for?
Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?""

Tyler said in interviews several time (also for House of Gold) that living for someone is actually harder than dying for them (which I personally think is extremely true and we don't think about that enough). I think he can be talking here about song writing. Writing songs about your loved ones, saying you would die and live for them but in reality (""the literally"" from above) when those persons try to reach you, you ignore them. So you say in a song you would live for them but it's not true in reality.
So it makes you think to these concepts of living and dying for someone in real life. Not in a sentence in a song. Who would you actually be dying /living/killing for if even your loved ones at home are not it? 
And that would be the part ""I've been thinking too much, help me"".


Then it's when it becomes even more interesting in the music video. After the second chorus in the sun, the dark is back and you see Tyler singing the ""I've been thinking too much, help me "".
When the last chorus starts, we see Josh putting sunglasses on Tyler, and Tyler on Josh. The sunglasses clearly representing their relationship to fame. They explicitly said in interviews that sunglasses are there to make them ""cooler"" and hide them. In the first chorus, when the sun appeared, they didn't wear them, they weren't prepared and were dazzled. Now, on the last chorus, they're prepared to live the fame, live in the light.
It's even more clear when you see that for this last chorus, the light is not the sun anymore, it's actual spotlights usually used in big shows. So it's about them living under the spotlights. And look how they act way more ""cool"" in that part than in the first chorus. 

But the song ends on another ""I've been thinking too much, help me verse"", Tyler in a dimmer sunlight, sunglasses still on. The all picture and the lyrics added represent the confusion of it all. How they want success and and can't handle it at the same time.

OK, wait, if you transliterate in English ""sun"" to ""Son"" then suicide would TOTALLY miss the mark!  The whole message of the song changes more to the whole ""let go and let God"" message:

I just wanna stay in the Son where I find              (Jesus)
I know it's hard sometimes                                   (We all loose focus)
Pieces of peace in Son's peace of mind           (The peace we find in Jesus)
I know it's hard sometimes                                   (Again, we all loose focus)
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much     (End of the WORLD Revelation)
But it's fun to fantasize                                           (Hollywood LOVES ""THE END"")
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was      (""who I was"" A raptured Christian)
But it's fun to fantasize

WHOA, not to mention that the lyrics listed here are WRONG!  He CLEARLY says:
""Pieces of peace in Son's peace of mind""  The word THE is not there in this line.

@Synecdochically 















This song makes me cry. It's so very deep. I think the general meaning is a struggle with depression and or dark thoughts. When the music is happy and upbeat is a good day. You realize you're going to die anyways so you might as well take your time. 
Even when he talks about the sun he still says ""I think about the end just way too much"" those thoughts never leave, they're always in the back of your mind but some days it's easier to push them away and stay positive.
He quickly can switch to ""I've been thinking too much. Help me."" And it just goes to show how quickly your mind can change course and how quickly depression can set in. It's a fight and the balance of the song between upbeat and serious really shows that!

"
931,Right in Two.json,"
Everyone has spoken about the lyrics but how about that awesome breakdown from 4:00 to 7:10? To me it sounds like a progression of battle music from primitive times to the industrial war machine of now. Here me out. The music goes through stages. 

The sound begins with sticks drumming. Imagine mankind in its infancy and small groups of men battling. As the drums beat faster around 4:40 we are now in an age of larger tribes warring. At 5:24 mankind has progressed into full on organized warfare. The sound here is heavier, more complex. The guitar screeching at 6:02-6:04 transitions to a new era of battle music. The guitar is the sound of a new battle cry, more aggressive and dangerous. The sound from here on out is more industrial, the drums hit harder like artillery rounds. The guitars scream like assault rifles. At 6:45 is another transition. The industrial war machine now marches forward melodically, with calculated moves, set out to destroy everything in its path.

Anyways, that's my interpretation of the sound and I'm sticking to it. The sound from 4:00 minutes out progresses from monkeys marching to the sound of sticks hitting coconuts to the sounds of the industrial war machine of today. Tool is a band that speaks with more than just it's lyrics.

			I love what you said and kind of agree but have a slightly different interpretation:

I actually imagine the beginning (around 4:00) is the rising of tension, that existed before humans started using violence as a resource. Then the first human killed his brother over some superfluous reason. 
Now this becomes a way of solving things, and pretty soon everyone's fighting over everything and nothing (Fight over the clouds, over wind, over sky and fight over life, over blood, over air and light, over love, over sun, over another). 
And after these lines, when the song is really exploding, is probably where we just started using violence as a first resource, without thinking logically about the best solution for any problem. 

And all this time Angels right beside us have had no other option but to wait on the sidelines, for the stupid mindless violence to end (which will probably never happen), unable to act.

I have bad news for everyone who wrote about this one. Unfortunately you have to really delve into this song and understand that everything he references through imagery is a metaphor. This song is about separation. And not just from each other but from God. We as humans are extension of the ego, and the ego tries to separate everything into more pieces because that is its true nature. But the separation only exists in our minds. We all know Tool is/was a huge Bill Hicks fan, and this was something he discussed from time to time. We as conscious humans believe there are multiple parts to everything, but we really are one whole entity. The more we try to cut things in two the further we are from our true selves and our true happiness. We are all actually in the ""garden"" the songs referencing right now, but we separate ourselves from it in our minds because we need to feed the ego.

But could also look at it more simply as Positive, and negative. Concsiousness is pushing in the positive direction, while The species going towards to unconcsious is getting into the negative side.  Splitting the two in two can be very important for spiritual growth. As positive surroundings and atmosphere is what helps growth while negative is what slows it down.

			Or we are constantly polarizing, instead of unifying in harmony.			

The meaning of the phrase 'right in two' is straight from the bible: 1 kings 3 16-28:

King Solomon, the wisest man to ever live is holding court.

The case is that of a child, and two women claim to be the mother, each saying that the child of the other died in the night, and her own live child was stolen.

The king said bring a sword, and orders that the living child be 'cut in two', and half be given to each woman.

The real mom immediately gives up her claim, willing to give up her child rather than see it killed. Fake mom says, sure, this seems a fair settlement. Solomon then correctly awards custody to the rightful mother.

We silly monkeys are like fake Mom, fighting to the bitter end, willing to divide things in two, destroying them in the process, in the interest of 'fairness', but without regard for the end result.

This seems a departure for Tool, using the bible with out sarcasm, but the song is about human nature, not biblical truth. In this case, the story from the bible happens to fit perfectly.

She had a face straight out a magazine

she was absolutely beautiful, might as well have been a model, gorgeous in every way 

God only knows but you'll never leave her

you will never stop loving her no matter how hard you try even if you are denying it, technically only “god knows” because you will not even admit it to yourself but you will love this girl eternally, maybe not completely, but always she will be in your heart

Her balaclava is starting to chafe

maybe her sweetness is fading away, she isn’t how she used to be, she is falling apart, she no longer has composure, basically she is becoming jaded to this world, she wants an out , maybe not directly through suicide but somehow

When she gets his gun he's begging, ""Babe stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.""

his gun could be his heart…she can kill him by breaking his heart. his gun is love and she can destroy him by breaking it.. he needs her to stay, he wants her to stay he loves her

I'll give him one more time

they will try one more time, its all falling apart but they need to try he loves her and she needs him 

We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
There'll be a riot, cause I know you

they keep saying next time things suck its done, its over but we wont go down without a fight because they know how special what they have is, the two know that it wont fade away easily..not just fighting each other but fighting themselves on the inside, fighting the demons taunting them if it fails and the heartbreak

Now if you never shoot, you'll never know

if they don’t try it how will they ever know? you need to take leaps and risks in this life or you dont know what beauty you leave under the ground

And if you never eat, you'll never grow

if you don’t take care of yourself you wont  become stronger…if you don’t EAT ie try something new like a relationship or love you’re not sure about, you wont learn how to live and be new in this world

You've got a pretty kinda dirty face

so many mixed emotions within this love


And when you're leaving your home she's begging you, ""Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.""

so much love for one another, she begs him to never leave him ever but times are changing, he needs to go out and live

I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Just said one more line
There'll be a riot, cause I know you

again they just keep keeping everything alive through second chances and living on the torn strings at the end of the blanket trying to keep the fire burning and alive but it is so hard…it is so hard to keep it even though their love is so deep

Well, now that you've got your gun

its finally ended, they’ve hurt each other, they’ve shot each other…reality has forced the lovers apart and they must come to terms about it, im not quite sure what did it but the love ending is hurting them 

It's much harder now the police have come

the police coming symbolize reality coming, the dangers of the world , how hard it is to keep the love once its under the scrutiny of the public and out there in the real adult world

Now shoot him if it's what you're worth

if you really care about him and you’re really a good person just cut this all off, no more second chances to be stolen or ROBBED from one another, please just let him and yourself move on

And if you just take off your mask

if you would just take off this façade, fake image you were putting on for everyone you would realize it is all so so wrong and you need to stop

To find out that everything's gone wrong, wrong, wrong.

its all different now its all wrong now cant you see it?? stop faking it move on let each other love others and see lightness, no more of this darkness anymore please , they both want to be past these gunshots they gave each other, but are so scared to see the other let their wounds heal

Now everybody's dead

no one is who they used to be, everybody has changed, no longer children or their past selves, who you used to know aren’t the same people anymore, maybe in the sense that your childhood town doesn’t embody the same people anymore , it is just the same place filled with different people, making it a new place.. everybody. is. dead. 

And they're driving past my old school

all my old memories of our past and my own past are flooding in and its so changed and different

And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on

now he has a gun, he has the capability to hurt others because he has been hurt, he has his suit because he is older and grown up and a part of reality, he isn’t the hopeless dreamer he used to be

She says, ""Babe, you look so cold, you look so cold, you look so cold, cold, cold, cold
You look so cold, you look so cold, you look so cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.""

the ex lover sees him and he is hurt and jaded and sad to the world now … he seems fine on the outside but he is cold.. and the irony is she was the one who made his temperature drop

the lovers are robbing each others happiness and chances in this world from one another. they keep giving each other second chances, “one more fights” only to rob new chances from one another. they cant move on and grow in love because they are so caught up on what they used to have therefore becoming robbers of new things to one another

@lolo2 hey, thanks for posting this, I'm a big fan of The 1975 and this song. I loved your take on this song, and I think it's correct and appropriate, and combined with the video, it makes for an even more beautiful feeling, because the video is somewhat a literal representation of the lyrics in the song, and coupled with this deep meaning it's true magic. Also, I think there is one problem with your post, on the 5th line, 'There'll be a riot' is never said in the song. Please consider it and remove that. Thanks.

I have to say that if you're wondering about this song, watch the music video. Never in my life have I seen a music video that is this accurate and beautifully made to say the least. It gets the song down to perfection. 

I think this song is about infatuated lovers overcome by the lust, the drugs, the thrill, the danger, and the flawed lens that they see each other through. 

She is this beautiful girl and he's this drug obsessed boy who's probably going to corrupt whatever ounce of innocence she has left. He's almost obsessed with her in a way, she's beautiful how could you ever want to leave her, and her infatuation with him only means she's not going anywhere. 

To give a more literal meaning of her balaclava is starting to chafe. A balaclava is one of those wool ski masks or in this case the mask a robber would wear to cover up his identity since it only has holes for the mouth and eyes. Chafe means to wear down, meaning her mask is wearing from all the use. Often times I found that Matty's lyrics can be as literal as it gets. This song is quite possibly as simple as two lovers that are also well, robbers. And I know it's considered a love story because he's said it point blank.

The next part, one more time, one more fight, one more line, will I know you. One more time, maybe it's their last time engaging in the act of 'robbing', one more fight I think literally means one more fight. I take it this couple fights a lot, whether it be the drugs, their lifestyle which has ever ounce of danger following it or a simple verbal fight. One more line, cocaine. From other 1975 songs, cocaine is a constant repeating topic and a line refers to that. I take that as the meaning here also because from the video there's frequent drug use that backs that. Will I know you, well will he know her? Will she know him? Will they?? Its out loud thinking, one more of this, then will we understand? That's actually a little cloudy for me.

For the next part, in the video he's playing with a gun and she gets upset over it. I almost take it as he's making a joke of this with her. If you never shoot you never know, if you never eat you never grow. Those aren't comparable things really, he's taking the situation too lightly and I think that's part of the infatuated lovers idea, he's a mess, crazy almost but she's so tied to him that she'll be forgiving even when he sticks a gun to her face as a joke. The pretty kinda dirty face, she's wearing down, either by this words, their actions, whatever it is she's slowly melting away from herself and falling for everything she does. 

The stay part, this is simple. In the first few lines he was begging her, he wanted her because she was beautiful and she caught his eye as this girl he could play around with. But now, she's begging him to stay. She fell for him, he almost ruined her. He's got her robbing whatever you wanna say, stores, banks, so be it. He's got her hooked on drugs. The video has him putting drugs into her mouth, it also has her doing a line of cocaine by herself among others. He was begging, and now she's begging. That's as simple as it gets, they're glued to each other basically. 

Then it repeats the one more time, fight, line but the last line changes. Be a riot, cause I know you. Basically, I can't say for certain if it's talking about her or him or both even but it's gotten to the point in their relationship where it doesn't matter how crazy they act or what they do or who they hurt or what drugs they're doing because they know each other, they know what to expect at this point that it's no longer an act of doing but an act of knowing. They both know, we're doing this. We're robbing this store and there's no backing out or being scared because we're crazy and we're doing it. They fully understand each other and they're now fully committed to their choices. This part of the video is very intimate, they're kissing and you see that they love each other. Toxic lovers. 

This next part, in the video they're standing there in front of a store that well they're going to rob. Their friends, or the rest of the band, is waiting in a van for them. They have a plan. The video doesn't go along with this next part exactly but it's easy to understand just by the lyrics. The police have come, so their plan is complicated. I'll shoot him if that's what you ask, meaning if you want me to do this I will, showing their connection to each other and their willingness to do whatever it takes for each other and for their safety. But if you just take off your mask you'll find out everything's gone wrong. I love that line, for many reasons. But meaning to the song, there's a couple. If you take off your mask, surrender really you'll find yourself in a bigger mess. Or if you stop if you back out it's going to be worse. Something complicated their plan and showing who they are and succumbing to their failure of the task won't make it better. 

For the end, I'll give the lyric and the video interpretation. For the lyrics, everybody's dead, meaning they killed the people in the place they robbed. But remember the police are there, meaning our infatuated lovers have been caught. I take it as they're put in the back seat of the cop car, they're driving through the town they pass his old school. He's got his suit on, that's the cops uniform and I see her standing there watching him, or sitting next to him. Either works because I see it two ways. He was taken into the cop car and she was left standing meaning that he was charged for the crime. But if she's next to him, then they both were. So the last line, which should be, you look so cool, it's her being in the completely flawed mindset that she's created, thinking the police taking him away is cool. He looks cool to her, basically her flawed mentality makes her think he looks like a badass being taken away by the police which is sick minded to think about when you're in the real world but she's not in the right mindset at the moment. The part of her that's obsessed with him and their lifestyle, that makes this cool to her. It's cool for the simple reason that she's saying babe you're a badass, we did this and I know you're being taken away but I love you and I love the thrill and yeah I think you get it. 

Now for the video, before the now everybody's dead part, which to go on a tangent and say that the way Matty sings the line, Now everybody's dead, just gives off the pure emotion of the song and it makes it raw and important. But back to the video. Before that line there's a pause and the video goes silent as they run into the store, then you hear shots. Second later the song picks up and he screams, now everybody's dead and the two run out of the store, no police are seen, but Matty is shot. They then get into the van and drive away. I think the way the lyrics go here, it could mean that they were successful in their plan except for the he being shot part of course, no one wants that. But they're driving past my old school, okay you could say they're driving past as they get away in the van being driven by their friends but I think the lyrics lose a little bit of accuracy here for the video. Then you see flashes of Matty with his gunshot wound, they're kissing, patching it up, and at the end they're at a diner I think you see him read this note that she passed to him and it says you look so cool, another reason for why those are the lyrics. But something about the video is cool if you notice it, Matty has a bandage over where his wound would be during parts of the video meaning that it's being done in flashes. So that's an interesting thing to pick up on and it tells you that the video isn't in accurate time order at points.

Anyways, I hope this cleared things up for some people. I think this song is more literal then some see it but I truly think it's actually about robbers, its as simple as the title. Sometimes its best not to look into stuff so much because the answers are right there. But this song for sure has the potential to be taken other routes which I saw reading other comments and I agree with elements that other people brought up. At the end of the day, this is a love song according to the genius that is Matthew Healy. It's a toxic love story about fucked up, drug addicted lovers that are completely and utterly infatuated by each other to the point where robbing a store is okay and considered cool. It's tragically beautiful and an amazing song and if you haven't yet seen the video I urge you to watch it because I think it's one of the best music videos I ever seen and helps with clarity about the lyric meaning. Andddd that's it, thanks for reading!

This song was inspired by the movie 'True Romance' and if you have seen the movie you can see where certain lines in this song were obviously written for specific quotes in the film. For example, the line 'you look so cool' was much like the line in the movie where one of the main characters named Alabama tells her husband Clarence that he's 'so cool' and she even writes on a napkin 'You're so cool!' plus one of the lines in the movie is 'You're so cool, you're so cool, you're so cool'. Many people seem to think that this song represents a painful love whereas really, the song is about two people that have fell deeply in love with each other and are practically partners in crime. 'We'll give you one more fight' implies that the two of them won't let the other fight alone and they put up a fight together as they have each others backs. 

'Now everybody's dead' in the movie, there's a room full of people including the police ('it's much harder now the police have come') and everyone ends up getting shot and dies apart from three people, the couple being two of the three. However, the husband gets shot but doesn't die-in the music video, Matty gets shot but it never shows him dying. 

I think people look too deep when really, the lyrics are what they are, there's guns, people are dying and nothing went to plan. Their love isn't painful or difficult, they're actually crazily in love and stick together through every trouble that comes along the way. 

I suggest watching the movie True Romance as it does truly give you a better understanding of the lyrics and it's a great film. :)

in an interview I watched once, Matty explained it as ""lovers robbing chances from each other."" which although I think there are many themes in this song (the usual sex, drugs, etc.) it seems to be the underlying one! by the way, I believe that last lyrics are ""you look so cool."" not cold.

This song is about being attached to a lover and not leaving them even though you should. The two lovers are ""robbing each other"" by staying with one another because they're not letting each other go and it's only causing negative effects.

This song is about his cocaine addiction.
The ""girl"" could be a metaphor- ""God knows you'll never leave her..""

But it's about the drug- "" if you never shoot you'll never know"" Like shoot up drugs.

""I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Just said one more line
There'll be a riot, cause I know you""

One more line of Cocaine..

and it was a struggle and probably killed him and was killing him.

He even says in one of his interviews he was a big coke addict.

I know the actual meaning has already been explained by the writers, but this is what I felt and understood when I first heard it. 

The song starts off as him finding her and thinking she's beautiful. She's stressed and edgy and so she moderately accepts him into her life despite being distant and not trusting really anyone. (""Her balaclava is starting to chafe""). I think the gun in this song represents power. ""When she gets his gun"" is representing the fact that she has the reigns in the relationship and she can control what's going down. Also, note how at this point HE'S the one begging HER. 

I feel like when the chorus first plays its showing how even though they have their rough points and she is cold, they're giving it another shot. She's giving him a chance into her life and he's giving her another chance with the gun to ""shoot"", or put a start to their relationship. Perhaps friends with benefits? 

The next stanza goes into the fact they give it a shot, (""if you never shoot you never know"") and opens herself emotionally, perhaps by sleeping with him. Note, how this time SHE'S the one begging HIM. 

Now, I first heard the bridge differently than the actual lyric. I heard ""well now that you've got your gun, its much harder now to place your c*m."" as in now that they've had sex he's acting distant and isn't really feeling it. They have the gun, or the power, and she's saying she will finally agree to progress their relationship or agree she caught feelings. (""And I'll shoot it if that's what you ask"") But she also points out that things have changed and if they were to both drop the cold facade and really look at each other, the dynamic in their friendship has changed so drastically. (""But if you just take off your mask, you'll see that everything has gone wrong."") Perhaps she wants him and likes this change, or perhaps she thinks that they've changed too much for this to be. I personally felt as if she wants him and thinks deep down, he was being just as cold as her from the get go. 

This next part also gets more ambiguous. (""Now everybody's dead""). I feel like he shot her down or backed out, or put an end to their relationship. Perhaps because he felt they changed too much, or he is no longer interested after actually getting what he had been begging for so long. 

""She says 'babe, you look so cold'"". She sees him as he is and he is now playing the cold lover. She assumed that role at the beginning, but now he's the one ignoring calls or denying a relationship. Her heart is broken and they are both miserable. (""The sky is gone, the sky is hidden"") 

The title ""robbers"" is more obvious, demonstrating the fact they rob love and affection from each other, and while she was the one doing this in the beginning, in a twist at the ending he shot down any chance they had so now all the bridges are burnt. Its a deep ass song, and I haven't been able to stop listening to it since hearing it!

About a couple who are in love with each other. Although the video shows them both smoking and doing drugs together. I believe he feels as though she is like a robber, who stole his heart, his mind and everything he owns and made it a part of her, making him hypnotised by her love.

Now that Daddy Yankee is on Interscope i am sure there will be further collaborations. I heard it said that DY wanted Eminem,Dre and 50 to be on his next album.

This is about the fallacies and ignorance and narcissism of certain psychedelic enthusiasts. It's a masterfully humorous song, and full of truth.

The part where he says ""Me, the chosen one. They chose me, and I didn't even graduate from fucking high school....""

It's a sort of slap in the face to all the psychonauts and self appointed mystics and shaman who walk around acting as if, or believing, that they have been granted special access to the mysteries of life. That they have tapped into some fount of knowledge about all the Big Questions that have eluded mankind since day one. Never mind the fact that many, more powerful, minds have been unable to give us definitive answers to these questions... they have been granted special access to the answers because...why? Because they took acid and believe in ufo's? 

No, because they are special, they have been chosen. It's a sort of narcissism, to think that you are so important that you get to know the mysteries of life that nobody else gets to know, and that you should simply be granted this knowledge and responsibility because you were wise enough to ingest a chemical that has been experimented with for most of the last century, by millions of people, some of them likely much more talented and intelligent than you.

The ""Rosetta Stoned"" feeling is a common occurance on lsd. I had it happen a few times when I used to take it as a teenager. You get this overwhelming feeling of having discovered some deeper, hidden meaning about life, a major revelation of some kind. But somehow, by the time you are sober again, the feeling is gone. Some faint echo of it nags at you, because it felt so real, what was it? Should have written it down...shit the bed...

Ok, so next time you take acid, and it happens again, but this time you are prepared, you brought your pen!
So you write down the essence of your revelation, this refinement of knowledge that has eluded mankind, but now you, the chosen one, can tell everyone, because you wrote it down! Good thinking!

You come down, and later feel that tug in your mind...what was it... oh yeah, the piece of paper! You pull it out of your pocket and read:

"" A circle and a square are really the same thing!!!!""

"" ""Pink should be cherished and respected, it s here to mitigate aggression.""

"" If I try hard to honor you, you will try harder to honor me.""

"" The important number is 3!""

Huh?

Is this some gibberish, and some paraphasing of ancient and well know pieces of advice like the golden rule masquerading itself to you as something you invented on your own? What happened, it doesn't feel as overwhelming to read it sober, does it? 
Hell, none of these ideas are new, and all of them have been descibed and debated in much clearer and understandable language than this psychedelic obscuritan drivel anyhow...

			I think you have a great interpretation of this song, but I don't agree with a few of the basic principles here.

Maybe someone with more experience in natural psychedelics can correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I know psychedelics are all about the death of the ego. I can agree that some people would be more susceptible to becoming narcissists, but for the majority the exact opposite effect is much more common. Selfish desires are dropped, bad habits are seen and easily fixed, and one feels sort of compelled to do good, live simple and try to set a good example for the rest of society.

As far as gibberish or strange thoughts while tripping. Well, it's very similar to dreaming. We all have dreams sometimes where we think of something that just seems so important or mind blowing, then when we wake up we realize it either was a metaphor for something else or was just a random memory concoction. However, this does not mean that all dreams are meaningless. Same principle for psychedelics. Sometimes you might have a strange thought ""The banana peel is THE BANANA ARMOR!"" But you might also think ""Wow, I just realized I've been being an asshole to everyone I come in contact with, because I had this bad experience in my childhood. Hmm, I shouldn't let this weigh me down, I know I can fix this. I can be better!"" These sorts of ""revelations"" can be carried over to sober states.

As far as ideas being genuine or new, no ideas are really genuine. You can say nothing that has not been said before. I don't think this makes our words meaningless. Everything you say and do has an effect, and that effect has an effect, and so on.

Also, I do not believe LSD to be as beneficial as psilocybin. Who knows if the acid you are getting is pure? For most it is almost impossible to know for sure, and this to me seems dangerous. That being said, it could be possible more of the irresponsible type could be attracted to acid. Irresponsible people could be more likely to become narcissists. That's just my opinion. DMT is a whole other territory than either of these.

All of that being said, everyone is different, so it's impossible to tell what kind of reaction or trip one would experience. I do agree there is ignorance in the psychedelic community, just as there is ignorance in every place on this earth. No group is perfect. You should always expect to see the bad side of any sort of people. Religion has shown this very well.

I didn't mean to attempt to negate your comment, I actually believe you interpreted this song very well. I just happened to see it, and would like to give my input concerning psychedelics and narcissism, since I know many people will be reading these sorts of comments and could develop a false sense of how psychedelics work. Go read a hundred psychedelic trip reports, and tell me if you think natural psychedelics breed narcissism. You might find the opposite is true.

			""This is about the fallacies and ignorance and narcissism of certain psychedelic enthusiasts. It's a masterfully humorous song, and full of truth.""

Ignorance is a lack of knowledge... a lack of knowledge that you displayed when you made this comment. Alex Grey does the artwork for Tool and was also featured in the film ""DMT The Spirit Molecule"". Similar artwork from the bands music video ""Parabola"" was featured on the cover. The film is filled with what you call ""psychedelic enthusiasts"" including Alex Grey himself, and explores the experience of DMT. It even hypothesis's its experience to be spiritual in nature and has connections to sacred artwork. 

So why would Tool make multiple songs (Parabola, Lateralus, Reflection, Rosetta Stoned, etc.) that made fun of the very person who does all the brilliant artwork for the band? Do you know how retarded that sounds? But of course when you lack knowledge and you can't help but express your opinions, you're bound to show the world how stupid you are.

			I liked your interpretation, although I happen to agree more with Moiraine.

Nature is wise and some humans are and some aren't. Nature offers some plants or natural substances that may enhance or may not our perception and even our consciousness if they're used correctly (sometimes even without the will of use them as they should they can cause some positive effect on anyone).

The key word is IGNORANCE. Ignorance of the people that don't know and don't use any of those substances (natural or sinthetic), just as ignorance of the people that use them.

I think (this is not related to the song or maybe a little) that there's an unespecific path to reach a deeper level of awareness that may help to purify our lifestyles and our minds.

			I think you're pretty spot on here. I did a project on Tool for one of my college religion classes and I used parts of this song. My professor proposed basically the same theory: that Maynard is mocking the phonies out there who trip on psychedelics and discover the meaning of existence.

Moiraine has very valid points as well. Maynard is not saying that the ideas and revelations that are brought about by drugs are meaningless. It is simply that they are not answers to life that need to be shared with everyone. The person in the story believes that he is ""the chosen one."" No one is any more chosen to gain knowledge about our existence than anyone else.

I think that Introverse's comments were unnecessary and rude. If that's your opinion then share it, but don't cut other people down. Also, Maynard and all the members of Tool let drugs like acid and DMT heavily influence their art. Maynard is not trying to discredit anyone who allows that to change their thought, and TheJackyl wasn't saying that. He is merely mocking those people who believe that they are special and more gifted than everyone else because of their drug use.

Just because you came up with gibberish doesn't make it a universal rule

Besides, ""Tool"" basically means drugs (and sex) are a means to unlock the mind, as used in most shamanic cultures. Hence, it's most unlikely that the meaning of this song is : ""ah, drugs! they make you see rubbish , a' right!?""

3- btw, you were right about the number 3!, and i'm not (especially) stoned, so ...;p			






			I think you have a great interpretation of this song, but I don't agree with a few of the basic principles here.

Maybe someone with more experience in natural psychedelics can correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I know psychedelics are all about the death of the ego. I can agree that some people would be more susceptible to becoming narcissists, but for the majority the exact opposite effect is much more common. Selfish desires are dropped, bad habits are seen and easily fixed, and one feels sort of compelled to do good, live simple and try to set a good example for the rest of society.

As far as gibberish or strange thoughts while tripping. Well, it's very similar to dreaming. We all have dreams sometimes where we think of something that just seems so important or mind blowing, then when we wake up we realize it either was a metaphor for something else or was just a random memory concoction. However, this does not mean that all dreams are meaningless. Same principle for psychedelics. Sometimes you might have a strange thought ""The banana peel is THE BANANA ARMOR!"" But you might also think ""Wow, I just realized I've been being an asshole to everyone I come in contact with, because I had this bad experience in my childhood. Hmm, I shouldn't let this weigh me down, I know I can fix this. I can be better!"" These sorts of ""revelations"" can be carried over to sober states.

As far as ideas being genuine or new, no ideas are really genuine. You can say nothing that has not been said before. I don't think this makes our words meaningless. Everything you say and do has an effect, and that effect has an effect, and so on.

Also, I do not believe LSD to be as beneficial as psilocybin. Who knows if the acid you are getting is pure? For most it is almost impossible to know for sure, and this to me seems dangerous. That being said, it could be possible more of the irresponsible type could be attracted to acid. Irresponsible people could be more likely to become narcissists. That's just my opinion. DMT is a whole other territory than either of these.

All of that being said, everyone is different, so it's impossible to tell what kind of reaction or trip one would experience. I do agree there is ignorance in the psychedelic community, just as there is ignorance in every place on this earth. No group is perfect. You should always expect to see the bad side of any sort of people. Religion has shown this very well.

I didn't mean to attempt to negate your comment, I actually believe you interpreted this song very well. I just happened to see it, and would like to give my input concerning psychedelics and narcissism, since I know many people will be reading these sorts of comments and could develop a false sense of how psychedelics work. Go read a hundred psychedelic trip reports, and tell me if you think natural psychedelics breed narcissism. You might find the opposite is true.			

			""This is about the fallacies and ignorance and narcissism of certain psychedelic enthusiasts. It's a masterfully humorous song, and full of truth.""

Ignorance is a lack of knowledge... a lack of knowledge that you displayed when you made this comment. Alex Grey does the artwork for Tool and was also featured in the film ""DMT The Spirit Molecule"". Similar artwork from the bands music video ""Parabola"" was featured on the cover. The film is filled with what you call ""psychedelic enthusiasts"" including Alex Grey himself, and explores the experience of DMT. It even hypothesis's its experience to be spiritual in nature and has connections to sacred artwork. 

So why would Tool make multiple songs (Parabola, Lateralus, Reflection, Rosetta Stoned, etc.) that made fun of the very person who does all the brilliant artwork for the band? Do you know how retarded that sounds? But of course when you lack knowledge and you can't help but express your opinions, you're bound to show the world how stupid you are. 			

			I liked your interpretation, although I happen to agree more with Moiraine.

Nature is wise and some humans are and some aren't. Nature offers some plants or natural substances that may enhance or may not our perception and even our consciousness if they're used correctly (sometimes even without the will of use them as they should they can cause some positive effect on anyone).

The key word is IGNORANCE. Ignorance of the people that don't know and don't use any of those substances (natural or sinthetic), just as ignorance of the people that use them.

I think (this is not related to the song or maybe a little) that there's an unespecific path to reach a deeper level of awareness that may help to purify our lifestyles and our minds. This may be achieved with or without the use of any of these substances but they may turn this path a little easier for those who are willing to pay attention instead of using them only for recreation.

Continuation of Lost Keys, its his answer to the doctor: ""Picture this if you will"" how he was captured by aliens or a mighty power that told him to tell everyone the world was going to end.
In the beginning its a tedious song by my favorite part develops and in minute 8 of the song, Maynard reaches a great pinnacle of the song with his voice: 

Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position. 
Such a heavy burden now to be, the one. 
Born to bear and write you all the details of our ending. 
To write it down for all the world to see. 
But I forgot my pen. 
Shit the bed again... typical. 

Great finale

@a7a8a9a1 















This is what I get from it, it may not be what you get, and that’s totally fine.  Keeping in mind the three languages on the Rosetta Stone and the above quotation.

There are three narratives that need to be deciphered in this song.  At the beginning we have the narrative of events told by the guy who is still suffering the effects of LSD to the doctors.  The garbled sound of the lyrics seems to accentuate the nonsensical lyrics themselves.  Then we get the second narrative, his inner thoughts.  This helps us understand the first narrative, he cant explain himself because he is still really stoned, but what he has to say does make some sense.  We are missing a third narrative, which is that of the aliens.  
So then what is the Rosetta Stone, his key to unlocking the cryptic message?  The title suggests it’s the LSD.  It is what allowed for the alien experience and makes the first nonsensical narrative possible, then the second more rational narrative.  The reason we are missing the alien narrative is because we have an unprepared individual with no frame of reference, he forgot his pen.  So he ends up missing the point.  You get what you can from the Rosetta Stone (LSD or the actual stone used to decrypt the hieroglyphs) but once you decrypt, you don’t need the Rosetta Stone anymore.  Once you figure out how to read Hieroglyphs you don’t need to translate through the stone again, you do it because you understand it.  Much like once you reach a bit of spiritual enlightenment you can “get there again” because you understand it.  The story teller was not prepared and therefore did not have the frame of reference to understand the new perspectives he encountered.  It becomes a sort of response to “Third Eye.”

What makes this song cool to me is the humor used to poke fun at the stereotypical high school drop out that trips out just to trip out.  Tool makes some great stuff.

			This comment is from 8 years ago. I wanted to tell you all that the message from the aliens is still there, but it's only how humans can comprehend. The protagonist can faintly remembering the idea, he just needs help putting it all back together. It's on the ""tip of his tongue"" and he's trying to spit it out. The best way to describe what the aliens told him is to imagine playing 5 different rhythms, each limb of the body doing something different and the 5th rhythm being when they are all put together. However, this doesn't even scratch the surface of what the aliens were trying to say, it's just the closest thing that listeners have to relate to it. It must have been crazy, and there's no doubt it was inspired from when Maynard was abducted by aliens when he was younger when he tripped on acid. OR DID HE JUST HALLUCINATE THE WHOLE THING?

“I think psychedelics play a major part in what we do, but having said that, I feel that if somebody's going to experiment with those things they really need to educate themselves about them. People just taking the chemicals and diving in without having any kind of preparation about what they're about to experience tend to have no frame of reference, so they're missing everything flying by and all these new perspectives. It's just a waste. They reach a little bit of spiritual enlightenment, but they end up going, 'Well, now I need that drug to get back there again.' The trick is to use the drugs once to get there, and maybe spend the next ten years trying to get back there without the drug.”

Dude, they aren't running out of ideas.  You can't expect this to a rehash of the highly enlightened stuff that was 'Lateralus'.  Look at 'Aenema'.  Just 'cuz the lyrics aren't completely mind-boggling, that doesn't make them any more amazing.  Tool is far from losing their edge, though this album is a little laid-back.  Songs like this prove Tool still knows what they're doing, and that they are one of the most amazing bands of the last decade.

"
944,Round and Round.json,"
(first verse) i think that it's saying that everyone's life is the same, and that people think they're original and individuals but we're not really. And the words circling and ""round and round"" kind of suggest the same, and that it's never ending.
""you don't have to hold your head up high"" as in you don't have to feel special, and proud all the time. 
And in the chorus, i think that he's saying that there must be another reason to life than this ^ and that he won't give up until he finds an answer.

All the emptiness inside you
Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
We're setting up to fail
You don’t have to make it right
Just hold your head up high

and then in the bridge ^, he's saying that you think you don't have a purpose in life and that that's ok you don't have to fix it, just be proud of who you are.

yeah sorry. i'm not really good with words :P

@catdragons 















The Imagine Dragon’s song Round and Round relates the authors hardship in finding a purpose in life, while observing the falseness of the lives around him.

In a way that neither condemns nor agrees, he tells how many live their lives lying to themselves thinking they are more than what they truly are. “We think we're making our own way”. Here, he relates the error in feeling in control of one’s life telling how people are all born with the same mindset, and are “all living the same way”, and they can’t escape it. In addition, he sarcastically points out the falsehood in self-righteousness. “You don’t have to hold your head up high”. Although he is critical of people around him, the tone of the song indicates he is simply disappointed and wants more. 

Although his inclination is to hide from the truth he decides to confront it. “I won’t run away this time, till you show me what this life is for”. His persistence is truly what sets him apart from others. While everyone else abandoned hope of finding what was real, thus becoming callous to their doubts, he sought to answer these questions even though it meant perseverance and waiting. 

Basically, the song tells people that if one doesn’t seek answers and face the darkness in life, they end up living a lie.

@pepperg 















To me this song seems to have multiple meanings. 

For one, it could be a love story. Partially because I've had something like this makes me think of happen to me. I think it could be about a guy who falls for this girl, or vise versa. But this guy won't give up on being with her anytime soon, hence: ""I won't run away this time"". That's basically all I think for the love theory. Someone who won't give up on love. 

The other meaning to me, could be about life going on and on. We are the way we are, and there's a reason for that. Life goes on, and we'll each be our own individuals, and no matter what, nothing is going to stop that. Or maybe you're afraid of something happening. For example, someone who's afraid of death. There's nothing anyone can do to prevent it; life goes on. Or 'Round and Round'.

My opinion on the song meaning is part of a love story. They keep on doing the same thing over and over again and it keeps going on, but thinking each time is something different. Unless you show him he is wrong, he is not going to run away nor change his opinion. Suffering from lies and getting pushed, but protected by their past love, one step at a time, waiting patiently. The point is, The pain can be healed, but without a source, you wont be able to fix it. You dont need to change it! JUST STAY STRONG!

I think everyone is hitting it right either a love song or about life. My opinion is, it's about life. One verse (witch is the reason why I looked this up in the first place) ""you don't have to hold your head up"" I think no one has really gotten the correct message along with that. My opinion is that it's saying you don't always have to be strong. You can break and it will be okay. Although it does say later in the song, ""just hold your head up high"" I think they mean it's okay to break but after a while but yourself up and be strong. Don't always be weak.

			This seems sort of likely if you run along with the themes of most of there songs, since most of them have got the theme of you can break but you need to keep strong.



I believe this song can have many meanings to many people but here is what I believe it means. 

I believe the first verse refers to the fact that we are all part of the same life and we don't realize or words and actions effect others and we all try to escape our words actions by hiding them under lies and secrets.

When it says ""You don’t have to hold your head up high"" I believe it refers to the pride we all feel,  that many will protect with their life. 

""We are afflicted by fiction"" I believe refers to the great plague of lies every one of us adds to. 

""Building a case for eviction"" refers to the destruction those lies will cause. 

""Guarding a tower of ancients"" refers to all the lies and secrets of the past you must continually cover up. 

""Shooting down arrows of patience"" refers to when someone begins to uncover your lies and secrets it hurts (as if being shot by an arrow) and you must cover it up and patiently wait for it to pass by, your mind painfully circling with every second that passes. 

""Round and round"" the endless cycle of lies and secrets.

""I won’t run away this time"" refers to the fact that you must stop running from the secrets of the past. 

""Till you show me what this life is for"" there must be more to life than the lies and secrets.

""I’m not gonna let you change my mind"" make up your mind today to stop running from your past and don't let anybody tell you different. 

""All the emptiness inside you
Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
We're setting up to fail"" people will try to give themselves a sense of purpose by telling lies to fill an emptiness they feel and only making that emptiness feel even greater than it was before. The lies are only setting them up for failure And the only way to truly fill that emptiness is by telling the truth. 

""You don’t have to make it right"" you may not be able to fix the lies of the past. 

""Just hold your head up high"" replace your pride with courage to tell the truth and stop running from your past or you'll become stuck in an endless cycle of lies and secrets.  Have confidence in yourself and who you are!

I really don't know but...I relate to this song. It's a girl living fast but wants the best, you know,  a good relationship with a good man. But she's a bit damaged. She's trying her best, but us girls who have big personalities an love smoking and drinking have a hard time.It's hard to get over being hard. You want love but you aren't sure. You're weary of promises and emotions because you know better. I'm a traveler who doesn't know how to stay, and i think I'm chasing love and home, but I'm not there yet. Thank you to Miranda who has made this real. I feel like her. I want those things, but i don't want them at the expense of myself

I have been reading about the true self which is how we are when we are born and we are supposed to be free and happy but we get told not to do things,told to do things we dont want, smacked, judged, controlled, shamed for being alive. The shame remains inside the brain/body having learned from parents and school and it becomes automatic, judging and controlling us from the inside. 'It' learns do do things to avoid abandonment from parents and the true self underneath is constantly screaming to reconnect with us, which is the fear we feel, so we drink, smoke, party, distract ourselves from the true self fearing the shame but wanting to reconnect. It is like having a small child and constantly ignoring it and or abusing it and it is screaming and you cant stand the noise and distract yourself. All it wants is love and no more shame and this conflict is going on in our minds unconsciously. On the surface we have cravings,copulsiveness and addictions that seem to have no reason to be there. I think what they call the ego is a screaming frightened and abandoned energy reacting to inner and outer shame. It's emotions and energy are constantly being suppressed and drugs are a powerful way to release it by force. If we can do what we truly want without any fear or judgement and notice when we feel shame from within and the feelings that come with it we will feel happy without needing anything from out there. There is a cure from all this dysfunction, that is all it is! :)

			I knew it was something like this, and why I was so fascinated by it. Basically, it's sung from the perspective of the unconscious, which is sometimes synonymous with the inner child. Innocent and impulsive, the inner child wants it needs met, but struggles with the higher conscious world's demands of work, stress, complexity and the issues that arise from not being able to have those met, further tormenting the unconscious until it surfaces from this repression through destruction and addiction.

Innocent and impulsive, the inner child wants it needs met, but struggles with the higher conscious world's demands of work, stress, complexity and the issues that arise from not being able to have those met, further tormenting the unconscious until it surfaces from this repression through destruction and addiction.			

I think this song about dealing with an addiction, perhaps an alochol addiction considering that Metallia was once called Alochollica.

@abrooke01 I looked it up on Google and it seems more that it was just a nickname given to them by the fanbase and such; I don't think they were actually ever officially called that.  But yeah, I agree with you on the song meaning.

uhh... since I once heard James Hetfield say that this song is about addiction, that is what I'm going to go with here. If anyone here has had the unfortunate experience of dealing with addiction you could see where it would make sense. Those of you who interpret the song as being about evil aren't far off as being addicted to drugs and/or alcohol is a bitch and sometimes leads people to do things they wouldn't ordinarily do. 
the lines ""I'm your life, I'm the one who takes you there....I'm the one who cares....do my dirty work scape goat......pay the price, pay for nothings fair.""  really work for the addiction scenario.  The sad fact is that you can turn your back on your friends and family but you can't turn your back on a drug. And once you are controlled by a substance,  and i mean really controlled by one it really changes your persona.

			I agree, 
also the lines reinforce the whole addiction/ alcoholism scenario that you mentioned.
""Hey
I'm your life
I'm the one who took you here
Hey
I'm your life
And I no longer care

I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
sad but true""

I've also heard many similar songs lyrically that are about addiction, one being ""Mr. Self Destruct by Nine Inch Nails""

I think its about a persons drug addiction, (or alcohol addiction which may be more likely), but, I think its from the perspective of said drug/alchohol, as if the item the person was addicted to was talking to the addict, corrupting him in a way but also telling him how it is, and what the item is telling him, is ""sad but true""

I thik this song is talking about God, but not in a possitive way. I feel like this song is supposed to be sang from the perspective of God and he is talking about how he says that he is everything for us, but it's not actually true. It says ""I’m your life
And I no longer care"" which would be God talking and it's true, God says he's our life but doesn't seem to care. This song was probably written to make people think logivcally and realize that god is either evil or imaginary, and i think that what they believe is that he doesn't exist and they're right.
Sorry if a offended anyone.

Ever had that one person that you felt you could never live without? Even go as far as to call them your ""other half""? That's how I feel whenever I listen to this song. You're so attached and you never want to let go. But than they leave you, and you don't feel like trying (or living) anymore. Even when they leave and you know they'll be back, you hate it because they're not with you anymore, until next time. You give your everything in the relationship, but they don't give anything back or they just leave.

@amirbe 















When it came time to film a music video, though, Shelton — who's been married to Miranda Lambert since May 2011 — chose to let an actor play the lead role. Smart move. It's a fairly steamy clip, after all, filled with PG-13 love scenes and slow-motion shots of a woman bathing in a tub of red wine. Shelton lurks in the background, sipping his drink and acting as a sort of non-participating narrator for the whole affair. Also, to drive home the fact that he's a loyal family man, he filmed the entire clip in the Ladysmith, the boutique bed and breakfast that Lambert opened last fall in Tishomingo, Oklahoma.

With a slightly different soundtrack, ""Sangria"" could double as a promo piece for the Ladysmith. The place looks great, its walls covered in reclaimed barn wood and Christmas lights. Over in the Losa Lounge, where the song's characters share their first drinks, a vintage jukebox sits in the corner. Later, when they hit the bedroom, they're surrounded by smoked glass and a headboard that might be as old as the building itself, which was built in the early 1900s. The Ladysmith may not be the cheapest lodging in the superstar couple's adopted hometown — if you want a room with its own bathroom, you'll be paying at least $250 a night — but ""Sangria"" makes it seem like a worthy destination…assuming you don't mind some pinot noir stains in your bathtub.

The song isbased on the personal experience of Doc Pomus (he wrote the song), who had polio and used crutches to get around and could not dance. His wife, however, was a Broadway actress and dancer. The song gives his perspective of plaintively telling his wife to have fun dancing, but reminds her who will be taking her home and ""in whose arms you're gonna be.""

			That meaning is pretty clear to me, it is interesting to hear the background.  I can't believe how many people interpret is as an uplifting song (although it does have a great upbeat beat).  Great for weddings, some guy commented.  WHAT?!?  Are you nuts?  The guy's girl is out getting hot with some other guy, and he is just hoping she ends up with him at the end of the night.

this is such a fun song :).  

basically, a guy is comfortable with the fact this his girl may dance with other guys because he knows that for the last dance, she'll be with him.

and she'll be going home with him :).

definitely going to be the last song played at my wedding reception.

The song is pretty self explanatory. He thought he would be with this girl forever but things didn't go as planned. Even though he loves her, he knows that staying with her will only hurt her more. He has to leave her in order to find what it is he's looking for. I think this song captures that feeling of not wanting to leave a person, but knowing that you have to, and the emotions that come with not knowing how to do it.

I am glad that true Christianity is not a religion at all....it is simply a relationship with God.

The pope is a king, the cardinals are dukes, bishops and arch-bishops are barons, priests are earls, and the congregation are the peasants that make up the majority but contain very little power. The Muslims have 2 groups, the Sunnis and Shittes who have been fighting ever since they began as individual groups on which ideology is right.

I came to this Idea, because in 10000 days he is talking bad about most cristians, which I now extended to religious fundamentalists in general, too.
What do you think about it?

			This song is about the inevitable atrophy of intimacy, which comes through a breakdown in communication channels through the participants (lovers) unconscious thoughts, feelings and behaviours.  But Maynard offers us the possibility of intimacy's redemption - he sings 'I know the pieces fit' - confirmed, still, presently - implying that even though the pieces have fallen away they would still fit if retrieved and re-applied.

@PhilosopherKing78 

Taking your point a bit further, it is about observing the dual nature of our minds, a cognitive dissonance and being aware of this afflictions various resultant forms of manifestation in our lives. It is a schism of our left and right brain hemispheres causing a split between our sacred male and sacred feminine characteristics, a separation of Yin and Yang, a fracture between logic and intuition, dis-harmony between the analytical and holistic thoughts of our minds.

With a fundamental understanding of this song and our minds we can observe the schism of the internal (disharmony of the mind) causing disharmony in the external (our world, our lives). You know the pieces fit because you watched them fall away.

When we can find unity once again, once we can reestablish harmonious communication within ourselves, resulting in harmony in our lives... we can make the pieces fit once again.

I have to agree with a lot of what everyone has said... the main fact I HAVE to agree with is that Maynard incorporates so many different meanings into his songs that almost anyone who makes an interpretation is correct, because he makes the music, and expects people to make their own interpretation and apply it to their own personal life... however i'll just tell it the way I see it, which is probably far from the truth, but it's my own personal truth.

For a long time I considered this song from the relationship stand point.  I still see the strong arguements made to the relationship testament in this song... it very well could deal with 2 depleted lovers... and how although once the pieces were all there, yet after losing everything they had and breaking into those ""pieces"", he wishes to re-find them... bring them back together... I mean that can even be seen in the video (but I'll make a different point on the video later) where in the end they come together, reforming the one... which is what i believe a relationship does.  It takes 2 people and forms them into 1 body... 

But that's not even what this interpretation is about... after a long time of pondering over it, I've come to realize I think the song is about the religious aspect of it all... there are a lot of Tool songs that deal with religion... so... here goes nothin.

Okay, the hardest area for me to cover is who the song seems to be coming from... I don't feel that Maynard meant for this to seem as if it's coming from his mouth... maybe these words are meant to be from Christ? but my best feeling is that the words are simply from any believer who can realize what has happened to ""faith"" because of the blunder known as ""religion""...

At one time, the ""church"" was one body.  It was a singular unit, set on one system of beliefs that everyone who had faith followed... there was none of this ""denomination"" shit...
""I know the pieces fit, cuz i watched them fall away"" (saying that he knows religion should be one body, even though it's not. he's seen the separations)
""Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing"" (rotten and burned up, to put it into different terms... when he says fundamental differing, i think he's showing the basis for the break... that from the very FUNDAMENTALS of the belief structure, there started to be DIFFERING feelings among people, and how they wanted to express them)
""Pure Intention juxtaposed will set 2 lovers souls in motion"" (meaning that although the intentions every time were pure, they were juxtaposed, or twised, and because of that, it sat 2 lovers [of Christ] into almost a square off to see who could be MORE correct)
""Distentigrating as it goes, testing our communication"" (simply saying the square off was what orignially caused the separation into pieces, and it caused a lack of discussion)
""The light that fueled the fire then has burned a hole between us so we cannot see to reach an end, crippling our communication"" (the light of passion that originally fueled our fire [love] for Christ is what, in the end, tore us apart and burned a hole between us... it's caused the end of the communication as well)
""I know the pieces fit cuz i watched them tumble down. No fault, none to blame, that doesn't mean I don't desire to point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over bring the pieces back together, rediscover communcation"" (I think here the meaning is that although no one is directly to blame for this break, because every ""piece"" that was broken was done in the name of righteousness.  Still, he thinks he's right, so he wants to be able to point the finger, say the OTHER was wrong. Yet still he wants to see the separate temples topple over, and the pieces brought back together, so they can reunite under one belief system.""

I know the end of that last interpretation was a bit shaky, because i say that the meaning of the ""temple toppling over"" was the separate temples, so they could be reunited... but i think my theory is backed up in the next paragraph.

""The poetry that comes from the squaring off between, and the circling is worth it, finding beauty in the dissonance"" (although the separation needs to end, the writer is saying that the separation NEEDED to happen... because the church split, and each went it's own direction, the poetry [writings, findings, ideals] that came from the separation, and the fighting was worth it.  It brings new truths back to the faith, thus strengthening it.)

The next paragraph just restates the others... that the whole was broken into the ""pieces"" due to the fighting and coveting.  The writer knows that they MUST return together. otherwise the separate pieces will fall.  They must grow, and strengthen, and reunite.

At the end, Maynard says ""Cold silence had a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion between supposed lovers"".... I think what he's saying is that the breaks have cause us to lose true LOVE for our counterparts (the other pieces)... and we're SUPPOSED to be lovers of Christ, or the one true god (whatever your belief states that that is)... but how can we be if we can't even get along with our fellow believers?

Okay, to wrap this all up... I'll refer to the video one more time... although it can be seen as 2 separate people becoming one, i believe it's the ""church"" reforming into one unit... I mean notice what happens to the 2 separated people [who represent ""denominations""]... they almost seem to be trying to outdo the other.  I mean one even stands on his head during the song.  It seems they're trying to show that they're the BETTER group (which you can't deny happens today). Yet in the end, the 2 come together, reforming the one true body...

Thanks for reading my entirely too long interpretation... I know a lot of what I've said isn't right, but I like to believe that my belief is pretty close.  However, once again, Tool's music is meant for you to make your OWN interpretation, so you can apply it to your own life... Once again, sorry this is so long (as are all of my other interpretations).  Continue to keep posting, and keep open that third eye...

suggestion: when the christian church was formed, it was by saint peter and saint paul, the TWO caretakers and preachers who, after jesus died, were left to carry forth the word.
saint peter brought the church in one way: individualism and personal interpretation of religion, the preachings of love and tolerance (from jesus), liberalism
saint paul brought the church in another: organization, mass production, the preaching of the book of revelations ie apocalyptic predictions, and persecution, esp of non believers...

perhaps the schism could be based on these differences that once worked together as opposites but were no longer functional and seperated into (more or less) totally different views on christianity?
it is a type of relationship: a the relationship of different and opposing (sometimes contridicting) characteristics of religion: a caring and forgiving god...a vindictive and vicious god (mother...father)

this song is hard for me to read but i feel like he is saying he is broken and hiding who he is but when he is with people who he feels comfortable with he lets down his guard and they have a good time:""While you're doing fine, there's some people and I Who have a really tough time getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky""
this makes me think of being at a concert where you let your walls down and you just live your life to the fullest and feel one with all the people.

The song is to God. He's saying there's no point in trying to hide anything from God, because God is all-knowing, and knows his heart from the inside-out- hence there is a screen on his chest. In the chorus, he talks about trying to be cool and make himself look like he has everything together- efforts which he says in the previous verses are futile. In the second verse, he basically says that he's messed up, but so is everyone else, and it's okay that we're all messed up because God loves us regardless- the reason God sent Jesus to Earth was because he knows every single one of us is a sinner. This is also the essence of the bridge- he's saying we're broken people, almost in a celebratory manner, because again, the fact that we're all broken just means that we each need God's grace.

I think that this song talks about him trying to hide himself from God.  He says, ""I do not know why I would go
In front of you and hide my soul
'Cause you're the only one who knows it,
Yeah you're the only one who knows it"" Also, he repeats ""we're broken people"" at the end.  This, with the fact that they have Christian background, makes me believe this song about him hiding himself from God, just as Adam did in the garden.  Also, ""having a hard time getting through this life, so excuse us while we sing to the sky"" is something that Christians do to praise God.  They sing and praise God.

I think this song is about having depression and trying to hide the bad thoughts from the person/people you care about the most. ""And I will hide behind my pride/ Don't know why I think I can lie"" Is saying how when we are are troubled or having one of those days where the depression is stronger we'll put on a face and ""gode behind my pride"" when we know we won't be able to lie forever. I think it could also tie into self harm, as we can try to lie about it but it always comes out.
And when he he says ""painting the mental picture that's in my brain"" It describes the way a depressed person might feel. I don't think this is a religious song like many are saying, I feel like a lot of religious people try to take songs about depression and relate then to their faith, which is fine, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. This is just what the song means to me.

I can't tell you what Tyler meant when he wrote this song but I can tell you what it means to me. 

Screen is a song sung to myself. I'm the only person who I trust to ""know my soul."" I have a hard time processing my emotions so my long-time method of handling them has been lying to myself about how I feel. I religiously live life with a screen on my chest because I've thought it makes it easier. You fool yourself into believing that you're okay and that things that affect you, don't. 

""I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool.""

I found strength in this false sense that I had my emotions under control. But eventually those delusions were shattered and the screen became transparent. There's a voice in my head which now counters my lies, saying ""Why are you trying to lie to yourself? I'm not fooled."" I feel like that voice is sarcastically mocking me when Tyler says:

""While you're doing fine
There's some people and I
Who have a really tough time getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky.""

Eventually, I listened to that voice beyond the screen. Because it feels like the first time in forever since I've actually been honest with myself and it helps me to trust myself more (because I don't). The first step to achieving emotional stability (for me) is accepting that:

""We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people.""

I feel like this song means different things to different people. For me, this song is about trying to hide your depression/suicidal thoughts from the person you love most. Of course, that person knows you better than that, and can tell when you're not alright. (""Don't know why I think I can lie"") This song, like many other TØP songs, is about putting on a mask and hiding the fact that you are *not* okay. But, that's just my interpretation, I know everyone has their own message that goes with this song.

Selene by the group Imagine Dragons could be about a girl who striving to be on top of the world and is lonely and heartbroken.

If you dig deeper into the time of Cleopatra Queen of the Nile, her daughter Cleopatra Selene and her fraternal twin brother Alexander Helios.  Though the only living survivor of her family I believe that the song could parallel her ""eulogy"".
The following epigram by Greek Epigrammatist Crinagoras of Mytilene is considered to be Cleopatra Selene's eulogy.

    The moon herself grew dark, rising at sunset,
    Covering her suffering in the night,
    Because she saw her beautiful namesake, Selene,
    Breathless, descending to Hades,
    With her she had had the beauty of her light in common,
    And mingled her own darkness with her death.  

More info just click the link en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…

I may over analyze sometimes

@Slade18 















As one of my favorite songs of the album, I think this is a reflection of love & heartache. & I say reflection because of Selene sat he goddess of the moon.

But I think it's about a girl who's heartbroken & refuses to see the good, or finds it difficult to forgive. It's like you're trying to reason with someone who has a broken heart but they only see what you've done wrong, & it's almost as if it didn't matter who you were or what you did... It would have been an inevitable discovery. ""Typically I was a validation on your sleeve"" as if to say ""all guys are the same"" (the ever-famous line used by pouting women). ""I can see it in your eyes & now they're crowning met he Caesar"" like you rest he bad guy. 

To me it's all just an act by the girl. The man has serious feelings for someone who has only ever been hurt in the past & so she refuses to see the good, & she's in love with an idea or maybe even a member of her past that she can't get over. So she dates other guys hoping to move on, ""love is clueless & destiny is wishing"", but in reality she's the barrier for moving on. Instead, she finds fault in every man, & decides that nothing is worth it.

""This is my heart, it's not he line, Selene"" goes both ways. They're both saying they're putting their hearts on the line, but only the one who isn't emotionally damaged is REALLY putting his out, because he's the only one who really has something to lose.

That's just what I think though.

I believe the song to be Octavian talking to Brutus.  One thing that supports this is the line: ""Cleopatra is the only one you loved.""  Brutus marries Cleopatra.  Then he is torn to pieces because Caesar was a father to Octavian and him and brutus are his only real family he is in touch with.  Then he fought and won in the battle of Phillipi and won afterward Brutus Killed himself. The song goes ""this is not what i expect this is not what i expect and now they're crowning me the caesar.

@Chnpo I hadn't thought of it that way, thanks for taking the time to write it ;)			

I agree with Chnpoon 

I thought it was about Augustus (Octavian) talking to Mark Antony and might have been upset/angry about his suicide and his betrayal.

With “I was a validation on your sleeve” Octavian and Mark Antony were allied and managed to defeat the liberators who were responsible for the death of Caesar. Antony Possibly attempted to treat Octavian as a subordinate.

and “Cleopatra is the only you loved” (Possible angry due to the fact he is married to Octavian Sister but is with Cleopatra, Caesars love interest)

and “I can see it in your tears and now they’re crowning me the Caesar” (Caesar and Antony were allies but after his death, Octavian takes his place with the Senate declaring Antony a traitor)

However the Chorus completely goes against this theory.

However it could also mean this......

What he wanted
""To the center of the pain                - Pain
Through your tattered window pane  - Romance 
To the middle of your heart""             - Want her Love.         

A man who badly wants the girl or attempting to use her pain to get to her. 

What Happened 

""This is not what I expect, this is not what I expect                       - Unexpected
I can see it in your tears and now they're crowning me the Caesar"" - Shes Sad

He has upset her, without realizing possibly become powerful in the process

Why it happened

""Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen       - Her Home, she likes someone else
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing""     - He is clueless.

He blames love and Destiny or/and her's firm decision to stick with a different lover? 

And whats on the line 

""This is my heart, it's on the line""    - Fear

He fears that he will not longer feel or fall in love again.

About a man who loves a girl who loves someone else, and in his efforts to change her, he has made her cried and ruined his chance/friendship and even possibly becoming powerful and feared. (Caesar) 

Just my Interpretation.

I think it is referencing Alexander The Great's relationship with his father; i.e. his father loved Cleopatra (of Macedonia) to suit him a rightful heir, as Alexander's mother was not of Macedon. ""Validation on your sleeve"" may be referencing that Alexander was a great millitary general at the time his father ruled and was nothing more than that.

I think that this is about Dan Reynolds and his wife, Aja. They are in a band called Egyptian together, which could be part of the line ""Cleopatra is the only one you love"".

983,Semen.json,nil
984,Semi-Automatic.json,"
I have always thought this song was about going though your day without even thinking about it. Your life just becomes routine and when you do think about it, its terrible and depressing. lines 3/4, ""Taking my only friend I know, / He lives a lie, his name is Hope."" His life is nothing except the idea that it will be in the future, and he feels like that's a lie now too. The chorus ""I'm never what I like / I'm double-sided."" He has two sides the side he shows everyone is the one he doesn't think about, the conformist who does what fits in, not what is right. then there is the real him, the person he wants to be. It me a while to decide what ""I kinda like it/ When I make you cry/ 'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside."" I believe it means He likes it when he disappoints people because he is doing what he wants, not what they want. And the paradox of his emotions vs. his actions twists him. And the the next verse about the horrors of the night, survival of the day, friends shrink as his fears grow. It goes with the verse after it about relief for the day coming but he knows it will go away at night again. So even though he doesn't like the way he is living his life at least trying to get through the day will distract him from all his scary and depressing thoughts he has at night. Thoughts that make him question his life and his friends. Then after the chorus repeats twice, As far as I can tell, he prays and decides he will ""live on"" and then he is ready to ""stand [his] ground/ Waiting for the night's return."" He will fight off his fears. 
I don't know if it is what Twenty One Pilots had in mind when they wrote it. Its what I got out of it though.

So I'm not too sure about anything but,
""I'm semi-automatic,
My prayers schizophrenic
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on""
Basically I think, that he doesn't think what he is doing first. He is so used to what the world tells him to do that he doesn't even give it a second though. 
Schizophrenia means ""split from reality"", it is a mental illness where patience experience social isolation. Although the most well know symptom is hearing voices, sometimes to the point of not knowing the difference between real voices and the voices inside the patience's head.

So either Tyler is hearing voices during and after his prayers, or that he is isolated from God during his prayers. 
I personally think the second one. The struggle to connect with God is a common theme for TØP songs. However, hearing voices is also mentioned sometimes. I still think that isolation better fits this songs context. 

Despite the no-questions-asked conforming to society and the isolation from God experienced, Tyler goes with it.

@maddi11259 















To me, this song represents what someone with depression/anxiety feels about the night. At least for me, the night can be dangerous. I start thinking in circle and becoming anxious. In the night, there is no one to talk to except for myself, and sometimes I don't really trust myself. ""The horrors of the night melt away under the warm glow of survival of the day.Then we move on, my shadow grows taller along with my fears and my friends shrink smaller as night grows near."" When the day comes around, our character in the song feels safe, he survived the night, he is going to be safe for this whole day. 
""I'm never what I like
I'm double-sided.
And I just can't hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry""
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.""

When the night comes around again, the other side of him takes over and he snaps. He may hurt those around him because he can't control his emotions. He says things that hurt those he loves, but it makes him feel better, because he was able to release that blind fury that builds up from the internal struggles that become hard to fight when the night comes around.

@atollon9 















I think that this is one of their more overlooked songs-but it's not a meaningless, empty, one only meant to be catchy.
The name is what throws people off the most, you would assume it's about self harm like ""Guns for Hands,"" but it's more about personality.
""I'm double sided/ and I just can't hide/ I kinda like it"" Is one of the stanzas that repeats constantly, which I think means two personalities- One at night, and one during the day. During the day, you're happy, cheery, etc, but at night, when you are alone in the dark, you begin to worry and overthink and drive yourself crazy.
Another thing that points to this is the "" I will be saved/ for one whole day,"", meaning you will be saved from worrying for another day. When the light comes, "" I will rise and stand my ground/ waiting for night's return"" meaning you will stop overthinking.
I'm the type of person who overthinks and goes a little crazy at night, freaking OUT about everything, making promises to myself or goals, hence the ""My prayer's schizophrenic,"" . I think it means that your judgement or thoughts are so clouded by overthinking that you are praying to, or thinking about, problems that are nonexistent.
Overall, I think this song is about how night is not a time for partying, like so much social media tries to tell us- it's also a hard time for many people, the ones who overthink and worry.

When I go over the lyrics, I can clearly see how he associates the 'dark' with depression like in the lines;
""I will be saved for one whole day
Until the Sun makes the hills it's grave""
It's easy to think that maybe he means that the dark brings with it suicidal thoughts, and he is safe as long as the sun is shining, but when I read the lyrics again and again, I began to wonder whether the song has anything to do with the 'physical' night and day at all.
My interpretation of this song is how he is trying to be at peace with himself, because we aren't 'what we like' we're 'double sided', we're just two-faced humans, with the night and day just the different sides of us. 
I was also dwelling on the lines - 'My prayers schizophrenic' because i couldn't make out whether he was actually talking about actual 'prayer' per se, because sometimes lyrics are like codes, you have to decipher them, they are not always what they seem, but I think it's just about the formality of a prayer, about how we are 'semi automatic' without actually praying because of our belief, but rather because it makes us feel better about ourselves.
The part which made me tear up though, was the part about his friend-'hope' Who 'leaves a lot' I guess it's just how we cling to hope, because it's our only way to make it out of this vicious cycle of depression alive, but he goes away, too often and we're just left alone, in the 'darkness'.

This concept of being ""double-minded"" or double-sided is from the Bible, especially the Book of James. So many of twenty one pilots' lyrics come straight out of the Bible. Double-minded means wanting to be one way (loving and serving God and trusting his will) but inevitably doing the opposite (doing something/being someone you don't like/being far from God or doubting his will).

Anyone who thinks the guy is a douche in this song is a complete idiot. The song is about him being with a girl who has a boyfriend and is only using him for sex. He wants to build a relationship and connect with the girl but all she wants is casual sex (whilst dating another guy I might add). Then when he's about to have sex with her, she says no, so basically she led him on the entire time only to crush his dreams.

@azbn96 You have to admit that he's a bit of a f***boy, though. As soon as the girl tells him she doesn't want a relationship, he basically says, oh, well, I guess I'll just f*** your friends instead then, even though they also have boyfriends.

Matt described this song as being about ""Your typical, prudish seventeen year old girl who doesn't know what she wants."" He also said it's labeled as very brash, but he intended it to be very romantic. Essentially it's about wanting sex or connection from a girl when they can't make up their mind about it, pretty romantic if you ask me. I love the anthemic feel of it

To me, this song symbolizes a specific situation. I think Matt is singing about a guy who is longing for something more than just sex with this girl. Ironically, all they ""seem to do is talk about sex."" At the end of the song, it truly begins to express how frustrated he is that he couldn't feel anything with her. ""They've all got back combs anyway, you've all got boyfriends anyway""---all of these girls are the same to him, and he's just looking for something different; something more than SEX.

Well. Since no one else has commented, I'm going to put forward three possibilities for the lyrics: ""I love your friend when I saw his film, He's got a funny face but I like that because he still looks cool""

1. He means that her boyfriend has a funny face but didn't have enough space in the song to add the extra syllable, hence ""I liked your friend ...""

2. Its from an actual and specific situation that he has personally experienced and so listeners will not be able to relate to this part of the song in the same way that they can with the rest of the song

3. It highlights that he wants to impress her by showing that he likes everything about her, even her friend with the funny face.

None of these explanations seem quite right but it's all I can think of so far.

i think this song is about a guy thats having sex with a girl that has a boyfriend.
and the guy really likes the girl and shes only in it for sex.

the guy wants to fill the boyfriends shpes because hes saying hes better than the boyfriend and will treat her better but shes telling him no because she still wants to be with her boyfriend

@kmT87 















I have a slightly different interpretation that I haven't really seen discussed on here. The song is about sex, yes, but its about doing everything except fucking. Here, I'll explain my thoughts. 

So the first stanza is talking about making out in the back of this guy's van. It says she wants him to use his hands and his tongue being shared which is, to me, probably indicative of french kissing or oral sex. 

He's dropping her off afterward and all they talk about is sex and, like most everyone else, I have no clue about the friend in the film. Maybe it just them talking about a movie they saw that night, IDK. 

The next part is them in the guy's room and he's ""about to fill his shoes"" which I take as a euphemism for having sex, the full on intercourse, and she says no. They've done this other stuff, but she says now, she's got a boyfriend. I think that ""filling his shoes"" works as a metaphor for having sex with her and also filling his shoes as a boyfriend. As others have said he does want to be more than just her make out buddy and sex, to her, signifies a step beyond just casual making out our mouth stuff. 

Then on to another time (I'm guessing) and she's making her way down, to blow him, and he's thinking, well shit if we're going to do all this, we might as well just fuck, but she considers the full on fucking as crossing the line between what she's willing to do as long as she has a boyfriend, and also there is this level of commitment that goes along with it for her that she's not willing to give him. Which is why he mentions her pierced tongue in the very next line as she's using it on him. 

After that he's saying he would date her or her friends and be their boyfriend, but they've already got boyfriends and they're basically indecisive girls. 

I can't really put my finger on why this song is so good, but there's this sense of real youthful sexual frustration mixed with loneliness and the longing for something greater than what someone is willing to give. There's a lot of sadness and unrequited desire going on which is easily identifiable with anyone who's ever had a crush or been in a friend zone. It's quite nice to me because I feel like what could be a relatively shallow song has an underlying depth of feeling.

this song is obviously about having sex.

""'Round these fields in the hot summer sun
Over by the gate Lordy here she comes
With a basket full of chicken and a big cold jug of sweet tea""

your sitting at the bar or in a restaurant and hook up with the waitress or bartender.  then you go back to your place.  could be.  i know a few guys who have hooked up with hooters girls.

""I make a little room and she climbs on up""

you invite her into bed.

""Open up the throttle and stir a little dust""

foreplay.

""Just look at her face, she ain't a fool to me""

foreplay turned her on and shes ready to go.

CHORUS:
""She thinks my tractor's sexy
It really turns her on""

his tractor is obviously his penis.  he's say that his penis makes her horny.

""She's always starin' at me
while I'm chugging along""

shes staring at you while your going down on her.

""She likes the way it's pulling while we're tillin' up the land""

you do her so she orgasms.

""She's even kinda crazy 'bout my farmers tan""

she likes his body but likes how he does her more.

""She's the only one who really understands what gets me...
She thinks my tractor's sexy""

hes saying shes the only one who does it for him right now and he does it for her.

""We ride back and forth till we run outta light
Take it to the barn, put it up for the night
Climb up in the loft, sit and talk with the radio on""

when your done with sex and you sit in bed and talk afterwards, was it good for you, etc.

""She said she's got a dream, and I ask what it is
She wants a little farm and a yard full of kids
And one more teeny wenny ride before I take her home""

they talk about possibly keeping the relationship going.  she tells him she wants kids and shes wants more sex before she goes.

""Well she ain't into cars or pick-up trucks
But if it runs like a Deere then her eyes light up""

talking about what kind of guy does it for her and how any guy can turn her own.

that just what it means to me.

I firmly believe that this song is about his failed relationships with people (as agreed by sirlenopow) due to his depression. As a person with depression, it gets harder and harder to maintain a healthy relationship because you don't feel like talking to anyone. As such, he 'shot, shot, shot a hole' through everything he loved by pushing them away and hurting them by doing so.

@issmith 















The situation happened me continuously during these two years, so I am very familiar, perhaps too familiar, about the meaning of this song. 

This song is an apology from the singer to a friend he loved romantically and confessed his love to. Unfortunately, the women he displayed affection to does not feel the same way back; in this case, their previous relationship was destroyed. 

The first phrase is an apology: ""I'm sorry for everything, oh everything I've done."" The singer is apologizing to the women he loved for not being a good friend but instead risked the friendship between them for ""romance."" The second part of the story describes the current situation of the singer: although he still loves the women, there is a barrier between them now since he confessed his romantic attractions toward her. ""Oh I'm wishing you're here // But I'm wishing you're gone"" implies that he loves and is afraid of meeting the woman again. The chorus, ""From the second that I was born I think that I have loaded a gun,"" implies that the singer acknowledges that he had hurt the woman since he broke the friendship between them by confessing his love for her. 

Skipping over the repeat of the melody, the bridge of the song is, in my opinion, the darkest and most expressive part of the song. ""In the meantime, let it go // At the roadside // We used to know // ... // At the bay side // Used to show"" evokes the pleasant times that the singer had with the woman he loved when he did not confess his love to her; when they were still close friends. The next part of the bridge, ""And there's always time to change your mind // Oh there's always time to change your mind // Oh love, can you hear me"" implies that although the woman rejected the singer for his love, the singer still hopes openly for her to accept him; for her to change the mind and accept his love. 

Overall, I feel that this is a very depressing song, especially since the exact scenario happened to me two years ago.

@zombielover 















This song is all about an apology to the woman he loves. He feels torn apart and lost in his life. He's looking for a way to escape and he's taking things for granted and realizes he's messing everything up. He's letting everything drift away and wants to be heard in his pain. He's shot a hole through everything he's ever loved. He's wishing in this particular case, he wishes the girl he loves were there. In the meantime, he's trying to let go of the people he loves. At the end, he says there's always hope and time to change the things that have happened leaving the song on a somewhat hopeful note. Overall, this song is in relation is a testament to failed relationships and his apology since the moment he was born. Therefore causing this song to be named ""Shots"".

3. classical -- the song starts w/ string music (from ""Dream On"")

lyrically, it has just as much depth -- classical seriousness to discussion (about politics, legal system, etc., other serious topics), but a huge rock/rap edge to it

brilliant lyrically & musically

I remember hearing this song when it first came out so I was like 11 and thinking that even back then this song is one of those ones that no matter what kind of music you actually listen to, where you're from or whatever you can relate to it in one way or another.

""They say music can alter moods and talk to you
but can it load a gun for you and cock it too?""

This line reminds me of how people tried to accuse Marilyn Manson for the Columbine Shootings.
Ignorant fucks, it goes with anything really if you listen to metal or whatever it doesn't mean you're some murderer to be or because you listen to hip hop doesn't mean you're a thug or whatever it's up to you.

I AM this girl, right now. This explains my relationship with this guy I've been with for a while. I think it's disproving what love songs say love is really like, and the stereotypes of what people think relationships should be like. Opposites attract, yes. And most of the time real soul mates, if you believe in such, are really so much alike and so different, and that's how love works. And people may think you're a weird couple, but they don't understand love as is and how it works. Fairy tales don't work that way. There's not always happy endings to the story (especially if you've read any of Grimm's fairy tales). Love songs are more of an exaggeration of what people think real love is like.

It doesn't surprise me that people would really turn this toward religion. As against religion as Maynard or the band may be, i don't get that from this song.

Being someone who struggled with different addictions i can definitely relate to every line in this song. 

""There's a shadow just behind me,
Shrouding every step I take,
Making every promise empty,
Pointing every finger at me.""

Drug/Alcohol addiction promises alot but there is always a price. People get high to feel good. However, You will feel empty when you aren't high, but you will be judged when you are. Hence the reason it makes ""every promise empty and pointing every finger at me""

""Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the finger rests.
Murder now the path called ""must we""
Just before the son has come.""


Addiction stands like a butler that follows you and like a butler it promises to help you through your day and the analogy of the butler on the finger as a way to use. Alot of drugs will lay on your finger especially if your snorting.

""The path called 'must we'"" references to me the ""Rules of the world"". Kind of a Damned if you do Damned if you don't kind of thing. Addictions will tell the user that they need to not be concerned with what ""needs to be done"". Just sit back and use/drink/smoke/whatever.

""Jesus wont you Fucking Whistle
Something but the past and done
Jesus won't you Fucking whistle
Something but the past and done""

Reaching out for answers but feeling like your past is the reason you won't ever find forgiveness or peace.(I mean come on how many of us have felt the negative effects of a night drinking/partying/smoking/whatever and gotten sick and cried out to God even if you don't believe he exists. ""God if you get me out of this i'll never drink again"".)  Asking ""Jesus if you are real all i want is a whistle"" or ""God if you are real now would be the time to show it"".

""Why can't we not be sober?
I just want to start this over.
Why can't we drink forever.
I just want to start things over.""

This is the argument every person has at one time or another during their time of addiction. (if you haven't then congrats you are the first i've ever heard of.)

""I am just a worthless liar.
I am just an imbecile.
I will only complicate you.
Trust in me and fall as well.
I will find a center in you.
I will chew it up and leave,
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down.""

The reality of what our addictions bring in the end. And i'm not talking about the recreational or social users, i'm talking about the ADDICTS who need it. Those who cant function in their day without whatever their addiction is. (i'm not condemning, i was there at one point too and i know how that battle goes.)

So there's my take. it's all based on personal experience so i could be way off. I'm not personal friends with the band so obviously i can't say this is what they meant, but when i listen to this song, this is what it tells me.

			I have read a few comments regarding this song, and for once I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised to read some people actually believe in many respects that this song is primarily about God and the proof of his existence. I believe the reference to being sober refers to those who are not drunk on believing and or following God. This like MANY tool songs is about God...period!!! Maynard isn't ""so deep"", ""so mysterious"" he's a puppet, a pawn for the devil!!! The only reason this band is where they are is because they sold out to the devil for talent and fame!!! This band will burn in hell unless they repent of their sin and turn to Christ!!! It always astounds me how 90% of the time people read these lyrics and interpret them, that people almost always turn to God or Christ in the reference and justify it as though ""well its not really about God"" but Maynard is just using it as a metaphor or drug addiction or insert your favorite load of garbage. The bottom line is God or Christ is blasphemed in dozens of Maynard written songs, and it's no coincidence, or happenstance but rather deliberate! Wake up! You people who channel these songs into metaphors and other arbitrary concepts are choosing to change the meaning of the songs to justify the fact that you as well as I know these songs are in fact evil wicked and wrong and you just want to justify your lifestyle because your conscience bears the true witness of the Godhead and you are simply refusing to change your life to live for God!! Quit justifying your wickedness stop serving the devil and see that these men in this band are evil and this song is no exception!!! They are puppets given fame and glory and riches by the devil for a purpose to lead fools astray! Satan is the God of this world, and whether you choose to serve God or Satan you are serving one or the other no matter what! Start paying attention to what these people are brainwashing your minds with people!!! All rockstars promote and encourage wicked behaviour and sin! Everyone in this band is FULLY aware that they are serving Satan and that they are on their way to Hell! Maynard promotes the devil and the occult and anyone who even scratches the surface of their image and music/lyrics knows this so stop ignoring it people! Be advised! Turn to Christ and repent! I once was fooled and beguiled by this band over 20 years ago, and now I know what they are and what they stand for! They are damning millions to hell!!!

Maynard creates a character that epitomizes self hatred.

This song to me paints a picture of the loop this man gets caught in, where he hates himself, and absolutely wallows in it. Instead of looking for change, he persists in this stubborn cycle of nostalgia and depression. He just wants to start it over, but he's too fucked up by now to do it.

This is one of the only Tool songs that i don't see the ""light at the end of the tunnel""

			the light at the end of the tunnel is in 46 and 2.  which is a continuation of the shadow reference in begginning this song.  in sober he is ""stalked"" and controlled by his shadow self (see carl jung) and can't push through till he faces and accepts it in 46 and 2.  At that point real change can occur.  oddly enough this has personal meaning for me because i learned about shadow self and jung in therapy while getting sober myself.

@Tunes24 agreed. I do think it may be because of alcohol and drug abuse as well. This is his personification of himself at his worst and lowest. Absolutely correct too @minty33

As numerous people have said before, yes, the chorus is a double-negative. ""Why can't we not be sober"" is the equivalent of ""Why can't we just be drunk"". I don't know if anyone else said this already, but I think Maynard was being clever with this song; the narrator is a drunk and a selfish hypocrite. Yes, he is an alcoholic. The shadow behind him is his CONSCIENCE. It follows him everywhere no matter how much he drinks and ""points every finger at him"" (AKA he knows he is responsible for his own faults, but will not accept it). ""I just want to start this over"" refers to his excuse for drinking, he wants to lose himself in the liquor and ""start over"", or in reality act like all his problems don't exist. He knows he is just a worthless liar, and is not willing to do anything about it. Everyone who has ever cared about him, he only made their lives more complicated by causing them the pain of watching his addiction consume him; they trusted him to take care of himself, but he let them down (trust in me and fall as well). The people who loved him watched as he destroyed himself (I will find a center in you, I will chew it up and leave), and despite numerous attempts at rehab, no matter how good things looked, he always reverted back to drinking (I will work to elevate you, just enough to bring you down). ""Trust me"" is a contradiction to what he clearly says earlier (trust in me and fall as well), he tells other people to trust him, that he can take care of himself, when clearly he cannot. ""I want what I want"" reinforces how selfish he is, he doesn't care that he's hurting others by hurting himself, he wants to drink and he will continue to do so. Its a sad story in my eyes. There's lots of people like that in real life I think. Of course this is just my interpretation though. All music is interpreted differently by different people.

@HammerFloyd  This is the best writing of what I felt when I was listening to this song. Thank you so much for writing something so correct in so few words.

@HammerFloyd This is exactly right .... This is from the perspective of the alcoholic who is pissed that everyone keeps telling him to stop drinking. ""Jesus won't you fucking whistle something but the past and done"" has nothing to do with Jesus or religion. He is saying ""Jesus"" as in a curse - like ""Jesus F-in Christ, would you shut up and talk about something else"" - he's saying this to the people who are always on his case.

Even though this song annoys the hell out of me, I have to laugh every time he says ""Some Beach"" cause it sounds like a hillbilly mushing ""Son of a bitch"" together into a two-syllable word (sumbitch).

I think that today's youth gets sidetracked from what love really is sometimes. One of my friends told his girlfriend he loved her after they had been going out for three days- he hadn't even seen her in person, only got her phone number from a friend. I think I'm pretty sure what love is, but then again, I'm only 13. I think that JB might know what love is. I think that its something you have to experience yourself and for all we know, Justin has been in love more than we imagine.

According to Frank Sinatra, this is the best love song ever written.  I tend to like George's love songs better than the Lennon/McCartney love songs just because they're much deeper, sweeter, and more sincere.  The video had Ringo & Maureen, Paul & Linda, John & Yoko, and (of course) George & Patti.  Although, George and Patti latter divorced, this song is still one of the most sincere and sweet love songs I've ever heard.

@0cool 















My interpretation:
Boy meets girl
She is the most beautiful (inside and out) he's ever come across
So boy is going to be honest with the girl.
Boy can't promise forever, b/c he can't predict the future
But boy would love to promise forever, b/c girl knows everything 
Boy is thinking and compliments him perfectly.
Girl does for and teaches boy things he's always dreamed of
Boy cannot pin one thing and physical beauty has little to do
with his awe of said girl.

Yes George did write a few great songs, but how can you say hes better than John one of the ALL TIME greatest. George was better than Paul though. Pauls songs are only good for hearing not listening too.

Someone commented that this song is based on a James Brown song, which is wrong.  It's based on the James Taylor song, ""Something In The Way She Moves"", which was released in 1968 by Apple Records.  George and Paul both worked on James Taylor's album with him, and George used the first line (and title) of James's song as a sort of temporary first line to start writing a song, but ended up keeping it.

			Thank you!! I've read lots of different comments about how this song came to be written but this is correct. Paul actually played the bass on James Taylors first version of ""carolina in my mind"" ('68, not the '72 version) which was from his self titled album and his only album with Apple and incidently the first artist other than the beatles to record with Apple Records. In Carolina in my mind he has a line ""with a holy host of others standing around me"" which was a direct reference to being in the studio surrounded by the beatles - but this isn't the comments for James Taylor songs so I'll press on. George had intended to change the first line of the song but as the song materialized and he worked out the other lyrics, he decided to leave it in.

I believe this song was a message for his friend E.Clapton:

""I don't want to leave her now,
You know I believe and how.""
and also:
""Something in her style that shows me.
I don't want to leave her now,
You know I believe and how.""

Until this part, GH was speaking about her, 
but now he turns to Clapton
as he changes ""She/her""(Pattie)for ""You"" (E.Clapton): 

You're asking me: Will my love grow ?
I don't know, I don't know.
You stick around, now: it may show!
...I don't know, I don't know. (this three really emphasized
and I would say angry or at least annoyed! Just hear him again.
It seems to me He`s telling him: ""I cannot agree on your taking her with you""
(in fact some time later Clapton came to GH saying he wanted to take Pattie
with him and GH said some kind of: ""You want her; OK, just take her with you"")
But at that time he still wanted to keep her and wrote his final message to
his friend E. Clapton:

""Something in the things she shows me.
I don't want to leave her now, 
You know I believe and how.""

I really can't say anything more except that George Harrison (in my humble opinion) was by far the best Beatle.  If it wasn't for him, they never would've experimented with drugs and they never would've left their bubble gum pop era.  Not that there's anything wrong with their earlier work... It's just their later songs had SO much more meaning.  That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.

"
1023,Somewhere With You.json,"
This song is about a guy who was dating a girl and they broke up after a long time. The two were completely in love and something happened to cause them to go their separate ways. Now that some time has passed, they are both going out with new people (""If you're going out with someone new, I'm going out with someone too""), but the guy cannot seem to get the girl off his mind and keeps reminiscing on their memories together. He goes through some of his favorite memories and then says that no matter what he's doing, he would always rather be with her. He even goes as far as to say that no girl will ever compare to her because he would rather be with her than any other girl he meets (""I can go out every night of the week, can go home with anybody I meet, but it's just a temporary high, 'cause when I close my eyes, I'm somewhere with you.""). It says that if they see each other out one day, they won't speak and he knows it but, even after all this, he's still always going to be with her in his heart (""If you see me out on the town and it looks like I'm burning it down, you won't ask and I won't say, but in my heart I'll always be somewhere with you."") It is a song expressing the love that has not left even after all the time of separation that they have had since the breakup.

			I don't think he's actually going out with someone new.  ""If you're going out with someone new, I'm going out with some one too""- he's just saying he's with someone to save face.

Also, I am currently obsessed with this song because it perfectly describes where I am with my ex right now.

			I completely agree. I think we gave all felt this way.  iKnow from my own experience there will always be that someone special and sometimes it's hard to explain ""why"". 
I don't think he I necessarily seeing someone seriously in theis ""song"" he is just finding meaningless people/situation to fill the empty space but it isn't working. :(   I can relate to this song...

My favorite line are this:

You laid me down, whispered in my ear
I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you....

Awesome lyrics n awesome song.

To me this song is about two people that are best friends and for some reason they never ended up together. He would always rather be with her but he doesn't think she has the same feelings for him. And even though they never were together she still always turns to him with the problems in her life and no matter what he will always be there for her. I see that song this way because I have a best friend that I am in love with but would never want to ruin our friendship by taking things to the next step because I never want to be without him. So instead I love him from a distance because I don't know if he has the same feelings for me and Im too scared to find out.

			Oh my goodness! I know your message was written a while ago, and I sincerely hope you've told him how you feel by now! Life is SO SHORT, what if you're wasting all this time and HE LOVES YOU TOO? I say, TELL HIM!! :) I am a hopeless romantic, but he very well COULD just be afraid to tell you, too!

And if not, you won't waste any more time wondering! Right? I wish you luck ;)

to me this song is about a relationship that ended and they're going out with new people, but the other person wishes they were with them instead... and he's also saying if she called him he'd take her back.

He loved a girl he will never be able to get out of his head. They loved each other with ALL their hearts but there are no signs of reconciliation. He does not know this girl anymore. He just knows the memories still exist in his head and eat at him. He would not take her back (""You won't ask and I won't say"") because I assume she left him and when she left, a part of him died. Death is irreversible.

I absolutely love this song!

This song hits home, I see it as this... This guy loves this girl after all of this time. Theirs something about this girl he can't get of of his mind. Hes replaying all these great times he's had with her because its pretty much the best times he's ever had. Hes telling her that no matter who he's with its never gonna measure up. Theres that one person thats gonna make you laugh the most, make you smile the most and just fill your heart. This is that girl! She moved on and he'd like to think he has too but he hasn't. Hes playing back his memories with her....Personally i find this song sexy in a way, if you've ever had this much passion with a person you could never find it anything less then sexy. 
Too respond too csnowman00... I think the ""then i'll go i'll go i'll go"" part means this... Shes saying ""I hate my life hold on too me"" Hes saying oh if you ever decide to leave (HIM - the new guy shes with, saying shes not happy) then hes saysing i'll go with you... I'll leave with you.. we can be together.. I don't know thats how i see it. Awesome song though.

He is still and always will be in love with her. Its as though he was just along for the ride but loved her so much he cant get passed it. She says ""i hate my life hold onto me""... she is unhappy but in his arms she felt safe. I think she ran away from his love out of fear. I believe she does love him. ""You wont ask and i wont say""... in my opinion means she would rather leave well enough alone and he knows it so he lets her be. She is with someone else to convince herself she is fine and he cant be with someone else without imagining its her he is with... very sad.. but its my life to a T. And again just the way i see it..

@ts474 















Well this is a lot different of an answer than some of you have given but to me, this song is about a guy being with someone (as in married) but being in love with someone else. The reason is that I dated someone who was married (he was in an open marriage--his wife was my friend and she actually encouraged us to date, then changed her mind, but he later told me that he was in love with me...) and this was a song he told me reminded him of me when we were breaking up. So basically I think of it as the guy is married but in love with someone else and he'd rather be with her than his wife; that he's always thinking of her, and although he may seem happy to outsiders, he's only pretending for his wifes' sake.

Also the line that says ""If you ever decide to leave then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go""...a lot of you are interpreting that as being what the girl is saying, but I think it goes like this....
Girl-"" I hate my life, hold on to me...""
Kenny-""Oh, if you ever decide to leave then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go somewhere with you."" 
Although of course for me it's reversed with me in Kenny's POV. I miss this guy so much and if he ever left her I'd go anywhere with him.

"
1024,Son of Sam.json,"
its not about the son of sam killer, or relationships. its neither. its about discovery and enlightenment. 

shiva is the destroyer.

when the world reaches the point where it is turned into a hell, shiva comes to destroy everything, as sort of a savior in a sense, before we become too evil. shiva destroys everything so it can begin again fresh.

the person in the song is describing his philisophical enlightenment, he believes himself to be the destroyer, so he is going about doing what he thinks his job is. the son of sam reference is doubt. he fears his cause may be in vain, and that he is just insane (a-la son of sam killer)  

in the end he is going to sleep, forever, as shiva opens his arms up to him, because he fears he is indeed just like the son of sam killer, so rather than live with it, he decides to kill himself.

@soulbot 















I can't help but think this song is about David Berkowitz (Son of Sam.) This guy ran around killing women in the 70's.

""couple killer each and every time""
""acting under orders from above""
""the clouded mind""

all references to Berkowitz

Berkowitz claimed demons controlled him and a talking dog told him to kill the girls. He later told the truth in prison that he really killed these women because of his shit relationships with his mom/other women and he would masturbate after killing these women. Berkowitz claims to be sorry for everything he did as of 2002, he's rotting away in jail and claims to be a Christian now.

As far as the reference to Shiva, she would be more..creative than destructive. I guess maybe this song is about good vs evil type of thing? The whole ""Shiva opens her arms now to make sure I don't get too far"" I guess too far out of her reach. Maybe he's saying he's creatively destroying himself. I mean, he did kill himself in the end. He was awesome though.

			I think this song is using Berkowitz as a metaphor. I think the song is saying... I'm a slave to my demons, the same way Berkowitze was a slave to his.

The Shiva reference is also interesting, because while Shiva is the destroyer, the destruction is done to clear the way for a new life (told the boss off made my move).

The overwhelming feeling I get from this song is ""I don't know what I want to do with my life, but I'm driven to throw everything away and try to find something else... even though I don't have anything to find.""			







+1








 
			I agree, I don't think it's actually ~about~ David Berkowitz. That seems a little too obvious for Elliott's usual style, so I agree that it's a metaphor rather than actually being about Son of Sam. Especially since he says 'I'm a little like you, more like Son of Sam'. If he were actually writing about Berkowitz, why would he say 'like Son of Sam' rather than just... Son of Sam, ha ha. Or Son of Satan which is what Berkowitz started out calling himself in the earliest letters to the police.

But I think you're right about the 'I don't know what to do with my life' as well. I think the song is expressing a feeling that he has the compulsion to destroy things, including good things in his life, and that if he continues to listen to this compulsion (like Son of Sam), he will end up with nothing. King for a day but with nothing for the rest of his life. It's more about desperation and kind of a self-aware habit of self-destruction, of ruining things for himself for the thrill of the moment rather than any long-lasting benefit. Acting on impulse rather than having self-control. It's one of his most interesting songs I think, and it reveals a lot about his thought process at the time.

But the saddest thing to me is knowing that before his suicide, he had actually moved a great deal forward toward living a healthy and rewarding life, having depression treated and being clean from all drugs aside from those prescribed to him, but in that moment he acted on emotion and killed himself.

This song is about interpretation of oneself and the conflict within.  It gives a sense of awe about what we are capable of, be it good or evil.

We've spawned from the love of a mother and the slap of a docter, to be thrown into the world to make our move, with nowhere to go.

We've the courage to not feel weird being out of our comfort zone, but we don't really have any other choice.

God's embrace keeps us close, but when you look at me, you are not looking at an image of yourself, but at a demon within.

What the hell are we?

Great Song Elliott!

@pete116128 















I think Elliott's father, Gary, is a doctor (retired now). Correct me on that if I'm wrong. Also, Son of Sam WAS a ""couple killer."" He shot at couples making out in alleys or cars with .44 caliber. Usually the men were just badly wounded and one man DID die. So he didn't just kill women, theough his anger was probably more fixed towanrds them. Elliott might be saying that his failed relationships make him a couple killer and that he didn't feel particularly great about it. He felt guilty, and that makes him no better than Son of Sam, because he knew he harbored a messed up love and hate for those women in his love. Since his dad was a doctor whom he repsected and loved, his mom was probably the nurse. Although the images are pretty sterile, aren't they? BTW, Elliott's relationship with his mom was strained. He got along much better with his dad, probably blaming his mom for letting him be abused by his step-dad. ""You tears are cheap"" he once wrote of her. I can understand why he said this song was written without Berkowitz in mind, creativity can be very sub-conscious.

The singer is the killer, thats what makes the song so scary.  He says the killer quotes John Milton on the walls, the singer claiming that the cops told him this, yet he himself quotes paradise lost: ""Farewell happy fields Where joy forever dwells "".

@Beltane 















The narrator was definitely the killer, and as far as I can see there's three clear indications of that provided: firstly, the echo of the early reference to his tale of murder befalling ""a man and his family"" in the question ""are you a family man?"" Secondly, there's the fact that the narrator quotes Milton, as others have pointed out, fitting the killer's MO, and finally and most eeriely there's the narrator's subtly but distinctly too-knowing description of the details of the murder (""those lunatic eyes, the hungry kitchen-knife"").

Brilliant song, gives you a crawling sense of terror and foreboding without ever hammering it's point home clearly.

@cassiusitsover 















This song for me centres around the ambiguity of weather the narrator is the killer and the irony of his wife being named Joy .

gloom, that's an interesting idea i hadn't thought of the inclusion of ""Red Right Hand"" in the song in quite those terms before...

Girgo, I don't think that the character in Red right Hand can possibly be the same as the character in Song of Joy simply for me the character in Red Right Hand is God.  the quote from Milton itself refers to the possibility of God's vengeance on the rebels.  

en.wikisource.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost/…

Farewell, happy fields,
Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,

Doesn't the fact that he quotes paradise lost, almost abscent-mindedly during the recounting of the tale of his children's and wife's murder clarly point to him as being the murderer?  He appears to be further implicated when he claims that the killer ""In my house he wrote ""his red right hand"" That, I'm told is from Paradise Lost"".  

The fact that the narrator first quotes Paradise Lost in conversation and then claims to have no knowledge of it, for me seals the case that he is the killer.  

affe, I don't see any evidence of the killer suffering from a split personailty or of this song being a kind of retelling of Jekyl and Hyde.  

I think this song is about a family man and doctor whose wife became depressed and he grew bored of her and in revenge (the quotation of Milton ""His Red Right Hand"" supports the theme of vengeanvce if you look at it in it's original context) he murdered them and took up the life of a vagrant to kill others.

GravityAlwaysWins I think that it is the latter.  I think the quotation from paradise lost 

Farewell, happy fields,
Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,

summarises not only the oncoming of Joy's depression but of the narrator's desire to murder his family.

You are right about narrator/killer being the ame. The absolute worst part isn't the past, but it is what happens after the story ends. These lines are building something up:

""Do you, sir, have a room?

@JASGripen I always thought there was some kind of ""warning"" or ""intimidation"". In a way he told the story to induce pity in the ""family man"" so that he can be hosted. In another way, he's intimidating him, if you let me in you're beckoning the murderer in your house. It seems like a riddle in a cold night, and he gives the warning when he says:
""Well, one night there came a visitor to our little home""
I always thought it was strange, I know he's the assassin, but why instill a doubt in his host?

was his insanity the cause of joy's depression, or was her depression the cause of his insanity? if the latter...what was wrong with her?  and even with the children?

Definitely the killer - that's what makes the song. Without it, it's just some guy telling the tale of his dead family to some other guy in the woods......who cares? It also would remove any tension or suspense this song had if he was NOT the killer.

And surprising to me, the thing that proved this to me initially was the one Milton quote no ones mentioned.

"" 'The sun to me is dark, and silent as the moon'.....do you sir have a room,....are ya beckoning me in?""

Or, basically, ""here's a John Milton quote Mr. Family man, are you well read, do you understand that i'm admitting to you that i killed my own family? How bout that spare room? You inviting me in here or what?

			'The sun to me is dark, and silent as the Moon,when she deserts the night, hid in her vacant interlunar cave.' from Samson Agonistes. In the context of the original poem, the lines equate darkness with death and light with life. Also, note the personification of the sun as feminine, and the use of the verb deserts, which in the poem reflects Dalila's betrayal of Samson. This imagery might be used to mirror Dalila's betrayal of Samson with how the narrator feels toward his wife and by extension children, i.e. she betrayed him by turning melancholy.

I think Dressed2Depress had it right, in that the narrator resented Joy's depression, since it robbed him of his own happiness.  The narrator hints that Joy was guilty in some way when he asks if it was ""an act of contrition"" that caused her sorrow, suggesting that she deserved it (in his own mind).  Also, he makes sure to point out that the daughters were ""their mother's children,"" which could only add to his sense of loss and feelings of resentment.

By once or twice I mean a couple hundred times"" could refer to urinating in the mop bucket, egging a house, being drunk, or cheating on Selena with a bunch of other girls. ""I'm missing more than just your body"", ""But you know there is no innocent one in this game for two"", ""Can we both say the words and forget this?"", and ""I'm not just trying to get you back on me"" show how he let Selena down. The rest of the song could apply to him either letting us or Selena down.

To me, this song is about not being able to make it work with the one person that you love.. 'the one that got away', even.

It accurately shows the entire development of the relationship, from the excitement of first meeting them (we touch i feel a rush.. etc.) - to the fear of being vulnerable with this person (i've been treated like dirt before 'ya).

He accurately describes how people want what they can't have during the development of a relationship (you want them when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change), but justifies this as he tries to explain that it 'must've been fate':

It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' but I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take

those defensive lyrics, particularly the first line, highlight his fear of this commitment and sets himself up for disappointment.

It starts with his partner no longer wanting him which breaks his heart and he does anything to fix it. This sudden 'roller coaster' and confusion sets him into a spiral of depression and anger which makes him angry that he can't have her so he tries to kill her in his confused and angry state. He's passionately angry over how much he let himself love her and how much she doesn't care for him. 

In the end, the artist put so much trust and knew what was at stake before putting this trust into the relationship, that when it fucked up, the effects were amplified causing self hatred for trusting this person (before i put this gun to my temple i told you this..) as well as the girl herself. 

This song isn't just about any relationship. It's about that one person you love the most....

Such strong lyrics, Eminem pwns as usual.. best song on the album IMO

My interpretation for the song, taking in consideration also the video, is that everything that is said in the lyrics are just thoughts about getting in an emotional relationship. People, who believe in extreme love but were hurt badly because of this, sometimes take the decision to remain cold all their lives and not show emotions, because if feelings are involved things can get ugly and dangerous. The song is a fight between him and his subconscious for not opening up. The lyrics represent the subconscious, who is reminding him how love is evil. He meets someone new that wakes up his feelings and the subconscious wants to threaten her to stay away, his falling in love and it’s exactly how he thought it will be and he needs her help to end it. He tries to explain himself how much love is in him and how badly it’s going to end if things are moving further. 
The only way he would open up for her is if she will convince him and promise him that it’s not going to hurt him, but nobody can make such commitment and he knows it.   Although he will remain cold because of love’s nature, he wants to be remembered by her that he exists, their love cannot be saved because it’s too late, someone hurt him badly before and he cannot be the same. He compares himself with a racket ship which can go far into space. She is very close to him, (Earth — Moon) and from all the stars from a clear night sky he aims at her (The Moon). Telling her somehow what sacrifice she is considering his potential, but still, he “aims” at her.

Why doesn't enyone else besides d32h9, gr1fter and myself see that this song is cleary about his battle with addiction.  I have to admit after first hearing the song I did think he was talking about a previous relationship, but listening to it more than once, it made more and more sense that it is the addiction he is talking about.  C'mon now people think outside the the box, like EM does, his words have a deeper meaning. He did and interview on sirius radio and he said the song is about the addiction.  It really doesn't seem like him to have more than one love song on this album...just saying.

			Well it does sound more like a relationship

""your heart's the moon""?

sounds more like a person to me

""imma show you what it's like to hurt""?

i didn't know that drugs, which are inanimate, can hurt

""i put both hands on your throat""

you can't kill drugs either

This song is by far, my favorite song by Eminem, aside from When I'm Gone, I especially love these lines
""I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes, my body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength, there's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries no lengths, why do we say that till we get that person that we thinks, gonna be that one and then once we get em it's never the same, you want em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change"" 

That whole verse is so true for me, I always have liked people who have had no feelings for me back, then once they do, I move on... it's so frustrating.

@iliketointerpret1 















This is Eminem's attempt at producing a sad love song, he succeeds immensely. Eminem tells his story of love from a different point of view which we're all not used to hearing. This song starts of with Eminem describing the feeling that Kim gives him and ends with him wantinging to kill her. I think this song shows the versatility that Eminem has in making music. This song is powerful, and like most of Eminem's songs, full of real emotion. 

Favorite line:
""love is evil
Spell it backwards I'll show ya""

There are various recordings and various spellings (stackolee, stagolee, stagger lee, stack a lee) of this song going back decades.  With it's explicit lyrics, Nick Cave's version most closely resembles 'The Great Stack-a-Lee' by Snatch and The Poontangs (a band led by Johnny Otis), in 1969.  The line ""I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one fat boy's asshole"" is actually from another Snatch and The Poontangs song called 'Two-time Slim'.

Stagger Lee songs are rumored to have come to America on slave ships- I've read that he's been killing poor Billy for centuries and centuries.

It is very rappy, I love that! Cave is a brilliant satirist, and if there's any good place to take the piss out the rap phenomenon, it'd be Murder Ballads. It's got a fantastic bass line, metronomic rhyme-droppin', and of course, all that fucking profanity. Absolutely genius. One of my favorite songs he's done!

1036,Stan.json,"
Now that Eminem is highly prased as a rapper today, I can actually look back and see the deeper meaning of this song. It is very morbid and no doubt one of Eminem's most controversial songs. However if you analyze the overall meaning it's really brillant. First I agree the Stan part means ST as in stalker and AN as in fan, symbolism of Stan. 
When you think about it, a lot of Eminem's songs are about his personal problems as well as society's problems. I think he used himself to represent a society problem, the media and music influencing people. Stan becomes so obsessed with Slim, and lives his life for Slim. I think he's trying to show the person's side rather than the music/media. It almost reminds me of the Columbine Tragedy, many people thought Marilyn Manson's music had an influence on the boys behavior and indirectly caused them to shoot innocent people. I think Eminem is trying to show that music may influence it, it is always initially the person who has the problem and not the music. You can clearly see Stan has mental issues which leads to his suicide and killing of his pregnant girlfriend (when he kills his girlfriend it actually really seems to symbolize Columbine because innocent people were killed because of madness). In the end, you hear Slim saying ""You cut your wrists too, I was clowin man, I think you need some help, why you so mad, I don't want you to do some crazy shit."" This part is the strongest in saying how you can't literally take all controversial music or use it to blame people's problems.

@Nancecowa 















I think that this song is to send a warning out to his fans. Of course we all know that Eminem's next best talent is stirring up controversy. If you listen to the songs on The Marshall Mathers LP, there are many reoccurrences of a message that says to his fans that a lot of the things he says should not be taken seriously, and that he doesn't really mean what he means.

I think this song is that same warning, except he's trying to use an example of what would happen if you take him too seriously. Stan is writing to Eminem about how he takes everything that Eminem says seriously, and Eminem writes back saying that Stan doesn't really understand him and that Stan should seek some help. Finally, we know what happened to Stan. I think the point of the song was to send out a message to his fans to not take everything he says seriously.

I don't think anyone should get offended by the way Stan killed his girlfriend.  Eminem was actually trying to send a real message in this video.  Maybe he could have done it less morbidly, but then, he could have been more morbid, as well.  The point is, if Stan had just killed himself, it would have been sad.  But the fact that he took this poor woman and her baby with him adds to the horrific poignancy of the song.  This song was about pain, about someone trying to find himself by living through another person.  And in the end, when his sanity came crumbling down...well.  The part of the song that hit me the hardest was actually at the very end, when Eminem is writing back and suddenly realizes who Stan was, and you know that maybe (lost cause though he was), if Stan had held out just a little longer, all that death would never have occured.

			Adding on to what @adrianosa said...

I think this song isn't just about loving someone. It's about the actual want of a partner. As @adrianosa says, ""He's in pain but he rather have that person close to him, even if it's a lie, than be apart."" What I think he's also saying is that he just wants love. Even if it's fake, someone there to make him feel just a little less lonely.

Here's a story...
Someone I knew, who killed himself, was pretty lonely. He felt like he was alone for a long time despite friends being with him and such. Later, come to find, that he would use online hookups intended for quick sex (also, like the song says, a one night stand) and would pay them for it too. Then, after investigation, he never did have sex with any of the people he payed to hook up with. Instead, as they said, he asked for them to just cuddle with him and watch a movie or such, then they would go.

Stories like that exist everywhere. People being so lonely and wanting love, but not actually wanting sex; Pure, innocent, true love. Sam Smith says ""Oh, won't you stay with me?
'Cause you're all I need
This ain't love it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me""
He knows it's not love and he knows she thinks the same, but he just wants someone there with him.

Only at the beginning does Sam Smith say anything that blatantly meant sex, which is a ""one night stand."" But he says it himself, he's not good at that. He doesn't care for the sex or for a quickie just to feel better.

This is a problem I've experienced and many others have too. Not wanting a lover for sex, but for the love itself. The person you can hold dearly in your life, and without having someone like that for so long, even if it's fake, anyone can fill the void at the lowest point. As I'm sure everyone knows, desperation can cause people to be irrational as long as it makes them feel better.

Just my addition and opinion

Beautiful song,before I interpret I'd just like to say that this is a wonderful song no matter the meaning. I think this song is about needing someone,and not really caring who that someone is. It's about being so fragile and broken that you feel like you'll fall apart and then someone offers you companionship. I think the woman or man was simply looking for a good screw, not knowing the agony inside him.""Deep down I know this never works, but you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt.""

I think this song is bittersweet and he's writing about the emotional connection that you get after being intimate with someone. 

She's told him it was just a one night thing...maybe for her it was to just get over an Ex or whatever but after being with her, he realizes that he has feelings for her which are sadly not reciprocated.

I personally believe this song is about when you develop feelings for someone you are sleeping with ... You know they don't feel the same way as you do but you're willing to be okay with that because being with them helps you deal with the loneliness that you feel ... You know that nothing is ever going to happen between both of you.... But they ease you pain and that's all that matters to you

Here's my take on this song and I think some people may have been through the same situation. What started out as innocence between two people friendship or otherwise when one of them eventually fell in love with the other person.  But the other person is mostly likely married from my take on ""and deep down I know this will never work."" But because he loved her so much that he is willing to settle for the few stolen moments he has with her.

This is personally what I think it's about just from listening to it a few times.

The guy in this song is just getting out of a relationship that has left him feeling heartbroken and empty. So he goes out and has a one night stand trying to forget his ex.

But he is in such a fragile state that he finds comfort in having that girl there, even though he knows there's not going to be anything out of the relationship.

All he wants is someone there to hold him.

My interpretation of this song is about a man who is heartbroken. He has a series of one nightstands trying to look for a similar feeling of what his ex partner made him feel. He knows is out of character for him to have nightstands because he has always been in a relationship . But he feels so lonely that he needs love even if it's for just one night which helps him ease the pain he is feeling from being heartbroken. It's clear to him that these nightstands with these women is not love but still wants them to stay with him after sex even if it's just to lay down with him because that's all he needs to ease his hurt.

This song is about we as individuals & society as a whole being overstimulated with superfluous bullshit, including sexual titillation, that we have become numb to the subtle beauty of things, & must always be striving for more (over) stimulation to the point of brutal perversion, (as in fist fucking up to the shoulder which is tantamount to killing). While fist fucking in this song is metaphorical, it is also quite a literal example of our societal perversion due to our materialistic drive & loss of spiritual connection.

I couldn't listen to this song initially, thinking it was simply a naïve rebellion in profanity, but in fact this is very much a rebellious song, however it is rebelling against the very quality many people consider so important today; the freedom to satisfy ones desires to the utmost, the greatest trick of our consumer driven existence. I find the juxtaposition of the song's lyrics with the brutality of the music interesting, the music portraying the quality of over stimulation with the exception of the beautifully  gentle middle break in which there is a mourning over the loss of subtlety. Very clever song. Intensely powerful in its portrayal of the resultant personal cataclysm. This is not a song about the freedom in satisfying debauched desire.

@adarchrds 















The illusions to fisting...extreme sexual activity in order to feel, the progression from a finger tip to knuckle to hand to shoulder...hoping to banish a numbness...requiring something shocking that you don't really want just to feel something...what does that say about a person? I think that's the point of the song.

What I think is interesting is that he seems to explore both POV here...the person being entered, the person who needs the pain to push past the numbness...and the person who needs to do the pushing, needs to force the envelope, in order to feel.

The dichotomy of sado masochism...but more, I think, in an emotional and psychological sense.

			I definitely agree. and I think Maynard also laments that that form of sado masochistic relationship, on an emotional, psychological, and a physical level, has become something that has been accepted to maintain excitement in a relationship or for an individual. It is my belief that he sees modern relationships as something more carnal that require a form self-mutilation in some shape or form to keep the interest, to quell the boredom. Hence ""there's something kind of sad about the way that things have come to be. Desensitized to everything. What became of subtlety?"" What happened to just being happy with either yourself or someone else? ""Boredom's not a burden anyone should bear"" comes across as sarcastic to me because it's not so bad but it's hyped up as something intolerable. That way that things have come to be is pitiable because simple pleasures no longer cut it to keep the interest.

Of course there are so many ways to look at this song because there are so many elements to it: sado-masochism, addiction, desensitization, complacence, the treadmill theory, love and even hate as well. This is irrelevant, but I'm currently studying film (not in school mind you, but I just have a camera and some equipment and my own collection of movies and literature on the subject) and my absolute dream is to make films loosely based on the themes that Maynard writes into his lyrics. I believe these themes can come together to make as interesting a character as Charles Foster Kane, Jake La Motta, or even Daniel Plainview. Sorry for rambling, but I wanted to share the inspiration I've drawn from Tool with you guys.

DUUUUUUUDES ....... Stinkfist is about all the stuff our minds are exposed to by the media in modern society.  We see so much stuff on tv that its desensetized us to reality.  To get our kicks now we need something more. 

All the stuff we see around us should repulse us(the pain caused by the fisting).  But it doesent because we're used to it.

I am fairly certain that this song is about ""borderline personality disorder"".  Could be wrong though.  It portrays a journey of emotion as he slips deeper into the borderline.  I often wonder why things are the way they are.  I don't understand why.  I don't understand why I let one person affect me so deeply.  Two years have passed since she replaced me.  I wake up not knowing what love feels like anymore.  Or if it was love at all.  I still wonder how someone can change within a single week.  I still ache within for apparently no reason.  I am only nineteen years of age and am ridiculously nonsensical for feeling this way.  With music I transcend the bullshit.

This song and many others enhance my experience on Earth.

@Mellow_Harsher 















Awesome song. A guy has clearly fallen hard for his ""dream girl"" (or so he thought ). After all, she seemed like everything he was looking for. Things really took off between them, and and came to a screeching halt just as fast. She doesn't love him anymore. He is emotionally wounded as he struggles to overcome his feelings of unrequitted love.

Moving on is hard, and the girl's not willing to make it any easier. Perhaps she just doesn't care about him anymore, or maybe letting him down easily would be too inconvenient. Whatever the reason, he is hurt, and the pain is so real that it might as well be physically inflicted. Despite the hurt, he keeps returning to its source, ""like a moth to a flame"". Love is irrational and this might not make sense. But the truth is, part of him still loves the girl and wants to be with her. 

Yet an even bigger part of him knows better. To feel whole again, he must fight these feelings and ""move on"". It's a struggle. But he knows he will make it. As he fights his poorer judgment, he searches for ""needle and thread"" (new love) to help stitch his wounds and bring him back to himself.

What if this song is his way of pointing out that men can be abused in a relationship just as much as a woman can be. What if he wanted to leave the relationship, every time he wanted to leave she would abuse him. This happened so often that he didn't know how to go about leaving her?

This is a shot in the dark, but it could definitely be a possibility..

@Hellodoggo 















The lyrics and the film clip are about the open secret of Magianism. Magicians often tie knots when they are weaving a curse and this is what ""stitches"" gives reference to. This practice is where the name wicker comes from because the knots were commonly used to create a piece of wickerwork. There is a price in the next life for practising black magic and ""gonna wind up dead"" refers to both the authors death and the price the Jinn (Demon) he worshipped in the ritual will extract from him as well as the death of the subject of the curse. 

Black magic can be fatal and usually manifests in the form of an accident; I would expect that the person he is singing about died in a car accident.

Don't believe me? You buy into the veil of absurdity that witchcraft hides behind and are distracted by the retarded herbal hippies with crystals right? Real magicians will almost never admit to practising witchcraft and will make a fool of you and cast doubt on its existence if you don't really believe. If you find yourself foolhardy enough to ignore everything you have heard about dabbling in the occult try this.

The next time you see someone with a wart get a viable green pea (without antifungal agent on it), hold the pea and say ""please help"" and touch it to the wart (getting a spec of blood or lymph [wart juice] on the pea will help). Wrap the pea in a piece of paper and later plant it in moist earth and as it germinates and grows the wart will wither and die. Cursing someone with warts is not much harder.

You will not thank me for telling you this if you try it and later die outside of Islam.

""I'm without your kisses, I'll be needing stitches"" [With putting the heroin in him ""Heroin kisses"" he'll be going through withdrawal and will probably start scratching, or doing whatever happens, to himself, during withdrawal]

"
1047,Story Of Another Us.json,"
""Replay the scene over again, 
Before the credits rolling in
Inside my head
I don't recall a single word, 
It hit me faster than I heard
Inside my head"" 

I think what they're saying here is that maybe this girl had been cheating on them, or maybe she had broken up with him, and either way he couldn't get the look of her face or whatever it was that they witnessed out of their head. ""Before the credits rolling in"" I see this as also meaning ""before we're over"" so before they actually end what they had, he wants to look back and make sure that what happened was true or if what's happening is what they really want.

""And now I'm shaking, wearing thin
I've always wondered where you've been
Tell me if you wanted it at all"" 

Maybe this girl was really distant and always out of it, never really there when she's with him. And when he sees her with another guy, he starts questioning if she ever really loved him and if she actually ever wanted there to be a ""them.""

""I got a long-term plan with short-term fixes
And a wasted heart to that just eclipses
And I push my luck and trust the dust enough
That's the story of another us""

Maybe when they were together he wanted them to last a long time aka ""long term"" and only expected minor problems like a little case of jealousy when another guy looks at her or when he leaves his clothes on the floor and she gets mad, but now they're dealing with something more, which is fading love. I think he's upset with how fast he fell and how oblivious he was to the situation, and if it ever became a thought, he would brush it off because he trusted her, and he has a ""wasted heart that just eclipses"" because he might have had to deal with this multiple times before and he ""pushed his luck"" because this time he thought it was going to be different. 

""One last ditch and new beginnings
So take this heart, put yourself in it
This surprise ending I'm depending on
Could be the story of another us""

When Luke says ""one last ditch and new beginnings"" he means that she can leave him one more time, but that's the end anyways, and something or someone new will come along. ""Take this heart, put yourself in it"" means that he wants her to see what he's feeling, and understand what she is doing to him. He hopes for a different ending, and he's depending on one that may end with them being together, but it's a surprise and there's nothing much he can do. 

""Memories are pay-per-view, it costs too much to think of you
I'm hanging by a thread
And ever long before we're done, I see quick to what we've begun
I'm hanging by a thread
And now before our hope is lost
My heart is here, it's such a cause
Tell me if you wanted it at all""

I think that whenever he thinks of her, it starts to hurt too much to handle which is why it ""cost too much,"" and he can barely hold on. He is starting to really see the reality of who they are now, and ""before our hope is lost my heart is here"" is basically translated to ""before we give up one each other know that I still love you and maybe we could make this work.: 

""Drowning beside you
Where I'll be to remind you
We're still first in line for
The front row of last resorts""

I think this part is more on the bitter side of their breakup. What Michael is saying is that while their relationship is dying or ""drowning"" he, deep down, knows he can blame her for what is happening between them. 

_

You may not agree with what I've said, but this is just how I view the song!

This used to be my fav. It probably isn't anymore but it still ranks pretty highly.

Anyway, I always thought the idea was no matter what, the narrator would always love this girl and always make an effort to be with her.

Nick uses a lot of religous imagery to convey a bleak apocalyptic picture which I don't think is a metaphor for the relationship at all but is either a deepistion of the world at large at the moment or an actual description of the world ending as Nick see's it and despite what's going on around him still wanting to only be with his love.

In terms of meaning it is a very similar song, I would argue, as (I'll Love You) Till the End of the World.  

Another possibility is that Nick is describing the death of religion or it's lack of compatability in modernity and decline and failure to remain relevent i particular amongst the intelligentsia.

Heaven has denied us its kingdom
The saints are drunk howling at the moon
The chariots of angels are colliding

It's quite an ambigous song and I still havn't concluded as to what its about other than love, rleigion etc

To me this seems to be about his drugs addiction.

The moment when the highs are not so great anymore and the lows are worse and worse. But still he has been captured and keeps going back.
The second verse describes this perfectly:
""Gone are the days of Rainbows"" 
""For the sea (the low) will swallow up the mountains (the high)""

The recurring sentence ""one more time"" seems also an obvious pointer towards addiction.

Just perfect. This was the song that made me buy everything Nick Cave had recorded. I think it's about star-crossed love, about everything being against you. That third verse is tremendous - ""the sky will throw thunderbolts & sparks/ straight at you"". That's not an accident, it's personal - something is out to destroy them. But he doesn't care. This has got to be one of the most powerful love songs ever written.

@inhumandecency 















I take the description of the destruction of the world to be judgement day, the end of the world.  Particularly the image of the 'ivory tower' crumbling, which connotes civilisation and privilege.  The fact that he returns to 'her' infers that she is the one, the one he is meant to be with, that he will take refuge with.

If we take the 'end of the world' to be a metaphor for difficult times in our lives, times when everything falls apart- this is when he goes to the girl he loves as 'I am captured' which connotes a difficult unbalanced relationship.  Perhaps he is running to her despite knowing it is the wrong thing to do.

The repetition of 'one more time' and 'once again' supports this idea that he is returning to this woman every time things go wrong, and that this is an unhealthy and destructive relationship.

Beautiful lyrics- my favourite is the 'gone are the days of rainbows/and gone are the nights of swinging from the stars'

"
1050,Strawberry Fields Forever.json,"
It seems to me that John wrote this song as a representation of a place that he goes in his head to escape his troubles.  When he was younger, he often took refuge in Strawberry Field.  This song is using Strawberry Field as a metaphor for a place he mentally wanders to forget his stress.				
				







 
There was an error.





@0cool 















The song opens with the chorus, ""Let me take you down cos I'm going to, Strawberry Fields, nothing is real, and nothing to get hung-about. Strawberry Fields forever."" 

It was written during the time of the Beatles, and has both figurative and metaphorical representations. One, it is an actual place John went to visit often - Strawberry Fields being an orphanage near John's home in Liverpool where he went as a young boy to escape his troubles — And two, this song is also using Strawberry Fields symbolically - a place he mentally wanders to forget his stress - yearning for simpler times. He also is frustrated and disillusioned with those who go through life blind to things going on around them, and too there are indications of Lennon's own insecurities about his genius. John invites us to come on ""down"" and join him into a world where there is no fussing, fighting, or killing.

""Living is easy with eyes closed. Misunderstanding all you see.

This is so true when you deliberate about how easy life is when you accept things superficially and don't utilize research. However, John knew that living life shallowly is not really living at all.

""It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out.""

John finds seeing things as they really are is no easy task, but he trust that in the end it will all work out.

""It doesn't matter much to me.""

And John figures if things don't work out ""it doesn't matter much..."" because there is no way he is turning back and giving up on the road less traveled.

The next verse begins, ""No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.""

It's apparent John is struggling with the notion that maybe he is not a genius after all. There's a saying, ""There's a fine line between genius and insanity,"" and John may, at that point in time, have questioned his sanity even for a brief time.

""That is you can't you know, tune in, but it's all right. That is I think it's not too bad.""

John lets us know that the mental state he is in is not a place where many minds ""tune in,"" ""but it's alright."" John's okay with knowing his psychic state is not for everyone, but hopes that there are enough intelligent and well-informed people to acknowledge brilliance and a greater message. Lennon tapped into primal emotions that never left his consciousness.

""Always, know sometimes, think it's me, but you know I know when it's a dream.""

I don't have the facts here in front of me, but I'm guessing John's confused about who he is at times. He reassures us though that even when he may be in doubt and ""thinks it's him,"" he is quite certain he ""...know when it's a dream.""

Before repeating the chorus one last time, John ends with, ""I think I know I mean a yes, but it's all wrong. That is I think I disagree.""

Again, the fine line of genius and insanity is gripping. John want's to agree with society, but he knows society is ""all wrong,"" forcing him to disagree with it's direction and conditions. John felt mankind could build reality from it's dreams.

this song is very deep and a classic beatle favorite. its one of those songs that john wrote that make you think, wow he WAS a genius. i really enjoy the orchestration and arrangement of sounds in this masterpiece. no matter what meaning it supposedly had in real life, it can mean many cool things depending how you want to see it. thats why it rocks so much

@smashingrocker 















I think this song is about youth...when he says ""living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see, its getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it doesn't matter much to me""...I think hes talking about fitting in and the troubles that teens encounter throughout adolescence...and strawberry fields is a place to get away by themselves, and that can be interpreted with ""nothing is real; nothing to get hungabout, strawberry fields forever!""...maybe he's talking about how he can just be himself there until he really finds himself as a person.

That's what I think anyway. Whatever the meaning of this song is, I think we can come to the consensus that it is a great song no matter what it really means.

"
1051,Stressed Out.json,"
I think this song is about growing up and realizing that you are human and that you don't quite live up to the ideals that society tells you you should. For example, society tells you ""Don't care what other people think!"" I think this song references that by saying ""My names Blurryface and I care what you think."" Plus I think Blurryface refers to the fact that he doesn't feel like he is just one person to the world. He is different things to different people, which goes against another rule that society imposes on us which is to have integrity is to be the same to all people.

I think he goes on to reminisce about life when he was younger and life was simpler. You could say ""I don't care what anyone thinks of me!"" and be unique and thrive off of that. As you get older you realize that you can't be so headstrong all the time, because we are just human after all. We care what other people think because we can't always be Superman all the time.

@jwcalifo  That's a good point!  Before I began reading thecomments, I just wanted to put my thoughts to words…

What I relate to while listening to this song is that our childhood days were our best days.  We had nothing to look more forward to other than getting out of school so we could play and be happy.  Sadly we all know now this isn’t the case.  Everybody has got bills up the wazoo, jobs we hate, and lives in which we are less than satisfied with!  Now I may catch some flack here (lol,) but I’m sure you’ll understand.
We’re not the first.  And we certainly won’t be the last who experience this turn point in life.  I’m thinking it from my parent’s point of view.  They are the ones who are struggling to get by.  Oh I could go on and say that their life’s choices put them exactly where they are today.  And look where we are!!  Great song!  I have to say.  But in my humble opinion, I would think that it would be selfish to “wish I could turn back time,” because our parents had to go through what we ""endure"" today.

The actual meaning of this song is that he simly wants to turn back time to the good old days. He misses his childhood and how easy life was back then.

That bit about catching a whiff of a certain smell sending you back to when you were young . . . Gods, I always thought for some reason that I was the only one who did that. It's always there and then gone again, so quickly that I can never even identify what it is, or where it's coming from, and I don't think it's even really a smell so much as a memory of a smell, because I've found that sometimes I can catch a whiff of it when I play certain music ( Genesis, for some reason, brings it up frequently, as does Rush on occasion, and certain Springsteen songs, and sometimes Paul Simon ), but I tell ya, if someone could find that smell and turn it into a scented candle? I'd probably go broke. 

Y'know, it's funny, I'm not a big fan of this band, but this one song? Just that one little line took it from being just an OK little ditty that I wouldn't seek out, but wouldn't necessarily change the stereo if it came on, and turned it into one of my favourite newer songs on the radio.

When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we’re stressed out
that power oh. and thenUsed to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we’d fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they’re laughing at our face
Saying, ""Wake up, you need to make money""
Yeah. YEAH that is just pure beauty!!! I look back on my childhood and just cry. I was a foster child. I was adopted at seven after being sexually abused from my father. he was good but then mom left when i was 5 and bam when i was 6 he changed to a whole other person. then i was taken away at 1:30 one morning wearing only a t-shirt and a pair of barbie PJ pants. I was given to a family who showed me what I should be like but I missed out on a major part of my childhood. And even though I cant I wish i could turn back time, to the good old days when our mother sang us to sleep but now were stressed out.

@jonjonwinny Sorry kid.  Don't want to frighten you or anything.  But it is the choices we make today that put us in the place we are tomorrow.  It's as simple as that.  Some have it easy because their elders are wealthier.  But most of us catch a few breaks here and there.  And I think at those times, we reflect back to our child hood days when things were easier to cope with.  I am one who caught a big break shortly after high school with a job offering of what ALL of my classmates would, ""I don't want to say the word,"" but you get the idea.

this is sad..im not really a justin bieber fan, 
but some of his songs are good,
to me this song means, there relationship would be frowned upon by there friends, family, peers, but they had such strong feelings for each other. they broke up or whatever , but they still love each other very much, but they cant be together like said in the line, ""like adam & eve, tradgey was our destiny"" , 
everything they had is stuck in the moment, meaning...he still thinks of her & the memories they had, hes still living in that moment but doesnt know whether to let go of her or not.

@babygirl90 















Instead of that straight forward relationship business, where it's frowned upon.
I see it to be as Justin is already in a relationship with somebody, but has fell in love with this girl he is describing. 

Here I believe he's realising that it's wrong what he's doing saying:
""You and I both know it can't work, It's all fun and games till, someone gets hurt, and I don't,
I won't let that be you.
I think he's saying that he loves having her to be with and spend time with but doesn't want her to get hurt at the end of it all.

But later in the song it's revealed she's becomed attatched to him and shares similar feelings for him:
Now you don't wanna let go, and I don't wanna let you know, that there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Realising that they've both fallen for eachother...

Here I believe that Beiber is saying how reckless it is to fall in love with someone else:
Now we don't wanna fall but, we're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy, cause I know you can't love me.
Saying she can't be with him becuase he's already with someone, most likely regretting kidding themselves in the first place - 'wreckless and clumsy'.

This continues throughout the song, I think it's him wishing he could have been with her.
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place, cause everything we did and everything we have
Is stuck in the moment.
I think that's bascially saying that if he wasn't taken, and had the same situation, just in 'another time and another place', things would have worked out for them. But they're just stuck living in this world of theirs and are relluctant to let what they shared go.

Just my two cents anyway, it's how it related to me.

no. a crush from a different town had told me to listen to this song because it described his feelings better than the way he could....but basically after i listened to it (and loved it) he said that he fell in love with me when we were together and when we went back to our own towns, all he could do was reminisce..if i spelled that right. he wished we could see each other again. but he said it wouldn't be the same because things had changed.....all of his friends thought i was just another girl to deflower and then he would move on...but he didn't want to cause me the embarrassment or hassle of trying to make something work because he liked me and he didn't want me to get hurt.  so he basically cut off all contact with me....but he mailed me a letter the other day saying....""I'm still stuck in the moment with you""

This is about a taboo relationship ... a cousin? ....a sister? Some intimate relation had to certainly occur as he pines to relive it in another place and time where it is possible. Conventional society is clearly against it.

I don't know if this song is about Justin as I noticed that it is multi-credited: Jonathan James Yip, Jeremy L Reeves, Ray Romulus, and Justin Bieber. It could be about something of any of these contributors.

I mentioned family taboos because they seem to be the most extreme that today's society would still most frown upon. If it is less severe, it is possible that it is anything from a secret gay relationship to some unacceptable relation between people of different races or religions or social backgrounds. I also mentioned the family thing because I can relate personally!

She's reminiscing about a love that she had during the time and it brings her ""summertime sadness."" 

This person is someone who made her feel electric, alive, and in love. She feels so invincible with this person that she could die and still be happy. Thinking about how much she loved this person and how this person may have been the best person she's ever been with, it brings her sadness. ""Even if you're gone, I'm going to drive."" Yes, this person isn't a part of her life anymore, but she relives her relationship with him by driving down memory lane.

Does anyone else hear ""I think I'll miss you forever like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies""? That makes more sense to me than ""I think I'll love you forever."" 
""I think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky.
Late is better than never.
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive.""
This is my favorite part of the song. It's as if she finally realized how much she's going to miss this person and has finally told them her true feelings. Even though he's gone, she's going to remember and honor how wonderful this time period of her life was. Beautiful...

			Please change him to her, if you watch the music video you will know what I mean.			

Nice. Everybody is so focused in partnership love.

I actually watched a Video, where there was a girl involved, not a guy. Though even before that I already thought it might be someone like a sister, someone who's not completing Lana like a partner would, but is/was exactly like her, a real soulmate. It seems, the sister wanted to suicide, and though Lana didn't, they understood each other enough, that Lana didn't want to stop her, just make sure she says goodbye.

Now when she's gone, Lana keeps doing everything they might have done together (partys, cars, what young girls can do), like in a trance, so she won't break down over her death, still feeling everything they felt together, but also (summertime) sadness and emptiness. And now she's not scared to die anymore, though she moves on. A little bit of an empty shell.

Irritating might be the ""kiss me hard"" part, though girls/sisters can kiss without beeing lesbian, too. On the cheeks, or it might be a greeting or some sort of code...

Besides: sisterhood might be much stronger. Usually the most people fall in love, lose the loved (without them dying), fall in love with someone else, lose them, fall in love again... but a sister you can lose only once (more or less).

Anyway... just my thoughts...

			I like your thoughts, just because something sounds sensual doesn't mean it has to be. Sensuality is an inseparable part of Lana, she could party or doing and still exudes sensual prowess. Besides, the music video features a girl that closed to her heart not a summer fling.

@iLLuSia same here, this song has always made me think of a girl i used to be best friends with who got really into drugs. we aren't close anymore but this song has always made me worry about her. 

i don't feel like this sounds like a romantic love. the video kind of confirms that. it's about a friend. perhaps the same friend that both 'carmen' and 'this is what makes us girls' are about.

I think this is her reliving some sort of fast-paced, almost destructive relationship with a guy. You know, one of those ""I'm deeply, dramatically in love with you, I'll die without you"" kind of things that almost every girl has at one point. And now, she's looking back with melancholy nostalgia, because it was passionate and dramatic and beautiful, but also not meant to last. The whole summertime sadness is the beauty of this ephemeral relationship that ended too fast, and can never be recovered.

""Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above all sizzlin' like your stare
Honey I'm on fire I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore""

Here she's remembering it, and feels like she's so much more wise and experienced from this.

Total obsessional love, the Lana Del Rey all-in masochistic approach to relationships.

Her guy leaves her as the Summer begins. Since she's addicted to him like a drug, her Summer (which should be a good time of year) isn't. She sings ""I think I'll miss you forever."" She will never get over him. With him, she could die happy. Without him, she just wants to die. That's her summertime sadness.

@yhtrownu 















There is only one thing that I can think of that is inherently and characteristically sad about summer & that is the fact that it has to end/is temporary. It seems like Lana is singing about something that is happening and she knows its great and enjoying every bit of it that she can, but she also knows that it has to end eventually & how much she will miss it once it's gone.

@lildragon 















She has lost someone dear to her.  A lover, I think, because of the line, ""kiss me hard before you go.""  This *could* be directed at a close female friend or sister or other family member but to me the line is more passionate and sexual than that.  I hug my little sister hard when I'm not going to see her for a while.  I kiss my lover goodbye.

She feels his presence this summer, as she does every summer because it is the season in which he died.  The elements remind her of him and freshen her fading memories.  It could be his spirit or wishful thinking but it's all the same to her.  It's been a while since she lost him.  She misses him madly and is somewhat happy just to feel him around.  Which is why she tells him, ""Kiss me hard before you go.""  She knows when the summer ends she will have to go back to trying to live without him, instead of just letting the depression consume her as she does at this time of the year.  I think it is this idea that inspires her to commit suicide in the first place.  She can't bear the thought of going back to trying to forget him.

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above all sizzling like your stare
Honey I'm on fire I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

She feels his intense gaze on her (""sizzling like your stare"") as she she dolls herself up for the occasion.  She is sort of delirious and euphoric at the idea of being reunited with her lover in the afterlife.  She feels ""alive"" and ""on fire."" She feels this energy ""in the air"" and all around her.    She's not afraid.  Nothing could ever hurt her worse than losing him did.

""Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight""

She senses him in the passenger seat as she speeds down the road and this gives her confidence.  If her suicide attempt is successful, she knows she will die happy.

""I think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies
Late is better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive, drive""

It has been so long and she still misses him deeply.  Because it doesn't hurt any less now than it ever did she thinks it won't ever get any better.  She considers the possibility that they may never be together again.  They are so close, yet so far.  She's a bird who is in love with a fish.  She doesn't care.  Even if he really is lost to her forever she would rather bet her life on the chance of being with him again than go on without him.

			I'm glad you all like my interpretation!  From the time when I wrote this I have since watched the music video and that has changed my perspective on the song a little bit and so thought I'd update!

In the music video, it is clear that the song is about another female, could be a friend/ sister/ whatever.  In the video, the friend commits suicide by jumping off of a ledge.  The singer later does the same.  The lyrics, ""Late is better than never,"" mean she feels like she should have been with her the first time, because where one goes, the other does as well.  She is hurt because she doesn't know why she would do that without talking to her or anything.  She thought they had this wonderful connection, and she knows they did, but she still is very hurt by the fact that her friend was in so much pain, so much so that she killed herself, but she wasn't able to help her and potentially knew nothing of it.

Technicalities and broading aside, whenever I hear this song I think of human connection and how stunningly beautiful it can be.

			Wow! I think of the song in a different way now!			

			I caught the general idea but I now understand those details. It really is a better song than people give it credit for.


			I'm glad you all like my interpretation!  From the time when I wrote this I have since watched the music video and that has changed my perspective on the song a little bit and so thought I'd update!

We've all had the too good to be true type feeling. While it's happening, it's already beginning to dissipate. The excitement which overcomes us, triggers the fear that over take us. Whether it's a passionate summer fling that burned quickly or a long lasting relationship that started on fire but never really quite caught on. Either way, the chemistry seems to be unmatched by any other flame that's lit or died out.

I've listened to the song and watched the video quite a few times. So, I think that this song is about moving on from an ex-boyfriend/girlfriend who has passed away, maybe unexpectedly. Lana sings that she's sad he/she died, but she is trying to move on, even though she will always miss him/her. Kinda like the Power of Goodbye by Madonna. She tries to kiss goodbye the summertime sadness that his/her death brought her. 

I think the ""drive"" part could be about moving on, but also, like Lahhva said, could be about reminiscing on their time together and celebrate their past relationship. Have no regrets and only remember the best. 

The video is interesting, because it is quite literal to the song, except that the roles are reversed and the ending is not so positive. Lana (I'll use the actors' names) is the one dying by committing suicide. Jaime King is wearing the red dress and drives a car with her bad baby (i.e. Lana) on her heavenly side. However, unlike in the song, Jaime fails to move on and commits suicide. 

Finally, I find it interesting that the girls don't end up together in heaven. I think it means that the relationship was passionate love - that is, it was a summer love more than anything. It was not going to last a lifetime anyway. In short, they were not soul mates, but they had fun for a short period of time. In the song, Lana embraces that part of her life before embarking on another chapter. 

Anyway, that's my interpretation. Great song and video!

In two different articles and Wikipedia, they're described as lesbian lovers in the music video. I took it as though they were lovers, it just had that kind of feel to the video with certain shots of them together in romantic ways. If some of you are refusing they're lesbians because you're biggots, then fuck off with your stupidity.The rest of you that refuse they're not lesbian lovers, just passionate about eachother, could be. Maybe the articles are wrong, who knows.

			Yes, I agree with you, there is no doubting it. The Video is literal enough. And the words spoken by Lana, at the very beginning, ' Remember I love you...bye' confirm everything that follows.

I can see a lot of my summers in this song - playing baseball, drinking wine and listening to the radio, the Yoo-hoo bottle (I had an addiction in high school), wearing a bathing suit under my clothes to go swimming...the song is supposed to invoke old memories, and it does...nice job, Mr. Chesney.

This song is absolutely amazing . .! All his collaborations are good & just like ""No Air"" this will probably be a hit. The music video looks awesome too!
I agree with dancehalldrugg, the person was depressed because their life lacked of something, in particular, someone. They found that person, who gave them the reason to change their way or outlook on life. 
Their love and acceptance brought out the happiness, confidence and the courage in him. Whenever he's with this person, she seems to bring out the invincible side or 'protective' streak in him, a side he never knew he had until he met her. Love has the power to conquer all and I guess the concept is shown through this song.

Being lost and not knowing where life will take you....feeling like there's nothing worth living for.
Slowly killing yourself emotionally.
But then someone comes into your life, and everything changes.
You feel like you can do anything.
You feel like nothing can stop you.
Whether they love you like you love them or not, your love for them has changed you.
For the better.

Dude, it's a *parody!*  

Eminem's just making fun of all those songs out there that are like ""I think I love you baby, I think I love you too...""  etc.  He's basically saying that they're full of shit and guys who say those things are most likey paying their girl lip service to score.

He's also saying (between the lines) that girls who buy this BS are stupid; he's not slamming females in general.

It's strange how intellegent his lyrics can be.

im sure a lot of people are gonna get pissed off by this song but im a feminist, and i think this song is kind of sad.  it says a lot about him.  His mother was a drug addict, and it sounds like his wife was a cheating drug addict, so of course he doesn't trust women!  Doesn't sound like he's met one that is worth his time.  If a female came out with a song like this no one would blink an eye, but its true, women can be just as cruel as men.  I wish the best for him, hopefully someday he'll meet someone who really cares about him, so he wont have to put up anymore walls.  Eminem is awesome.

I got a laugh out of the comments on here though, all the women saying they love him, et cetera. He's talking about you kind of people in the song... 

Regardless, though, I like the beat and the fact that Eminem is not reserved in his songs. Anyone's who's been with a shallow or slutty girl may not feel this passionate but they can definately relate to an extent.

@Revelation 















i really can't understand why everyone can't lighten the hell up and laugh at this song, cause i think it's pretty funny. I am a female, but unlike many people who've already posted, listening to this song does not make me want to jump Eminem's bones, nor does it make me want to cause him bodily harm. how can you get pissed at him for speaking the truth? yeah there are women out there who are sluts and liars and only want to hook up with him because he's famous or rich or whatever. more power to him for calling them on it. does it make him sexist if its true????!!!!! Furthermore, the majority of the insults in the song are directed to the following types of women: Sluts, Hos, and Bitches.  I don't fall into any of those categories, so maybe that's why i don't take it so personally.
also, guys are liars and sluts too, we all know that. if a chick sang this song would you all be jumping on her calling her sexist?? probably not, but there's the double standard.

tazzy:
 he said you want what you can't have, don't touch what you can't grab, end up with two back hands...
*to back hand someone generally means to bitch slap them as far as i know, so he probably means you can't have me, don't touch me or you're gonna get smacked* 
that's what i get out of it anyway.

@BrianNeville 















A lot of things in this song are funny (yeah, the anthrax lyric is ""pure eminem"" as someone said), but it's also a very melancholy and touching song...
The thing I love about it (and about a lot of Eminem's music), is it isn't nearly so mindless as some of the rap you hear where they're just pure ""sex fuck bitch whores ima gangsta woo drugs""
There are actual meanings and stories behind his lyrics, and real feelings, and the sounds within the songs give his music a huge touch of personality. (This is partially in response to the person who disagrees with this music btw) Even if some people might take the music ""seriously,"" it is unfortunately because they're too stupid to listen to it closely, and that is something that is unavoidable with any medium (and I don't think that a stable person will actually imitate what they hear in this music anyway). As far as bad treatment of women in his music, yes, it is unfortunate, but it isn't bad treatment of women, and a lot of his songs are really mocking more than anything. (And he does seem to love his daughter and care for her greatly, which implies that it is more that he's jaded, than that he's just inherently an asshole, especially what with bitterness at his mother and his wife, etc etc)
Anyway, regarding this song specifically: it isn't just about hating on women, really. At least, I think it's more about encountering all these fake, whorish women (and perhaps he just attracts them, or it's partially because of his outlook, but nonetheless). It's basically the outpouring of a very very hurt individual who has put a barrier. The lyric ""maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll some day grow"" is very important in this, as well as the lyrics when the girls are talking about being unfazed, in which they're portrayed as trying to prove they can be trusted, even though they more likely just want to hump the guy (and again, vice versa ... eminem obviously feels the same way)
It's just a statement of his state of mind saying that relationship(s?) have fucked him over and he's just too sick of it to care anymore - for now.

this song is basically about how he loves her so much but he feels trapped because of her suspicions. he's like don't throw our love away and keeps trying to convince her of his innocence 

he can't let go of her love but he just can't keep going on like this - it has to end and he's promised he's never lied - love the song!

Most disingenuous song ever.  If he loved a woman 'too much' why not spend all his time with her?  There's no room for suspicion then.  He wanted to bully and nag his wife into suspending disbelief so that he could keep doing what he wanted to do.  He wore a jumpsuit because he was an emotional toddler.  It's too bad that nobody counselled him well enough for him to live a better and longer life as his voice was a beautiful thing.

Anyway, it's about two people that don't trust each other and can't figure out what to do with thier relationship, they sound like they both need help.  maybe that's why the chorus is so repeatitive.  It represents the monotnous cycle of indecision and procrastination.  Niether has the guts to be honest so they make up fears of the other lying.

The girl is addicted to drugs(heroin probably) and she's spending her money she earns as a waiter and her husbands money as well. While the singer is the drug dealer thats why he tries to keep her husband away from her so he can have her  money.

Thats why he is saying

I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time""

			Well mrsbrunomars how can he say ""i want you back"" if he's looking for sumone he's never met?			

			maybe he lost that dream of ever finding that perfecct girl for him,  and he wants that dream back.			

I believe it is about a girl who he loved and she meant everything to him. It may or may not have ended on a bad note,but she moved away, or they lost touch completely. He was the one to break up and it was a mistake and so he has been regretting it ever since. He never got the chance to say sorry for hurting her, and now lives everyday of his life hoping that somehow she could hear him. Anyway, thats what I think of it, its truely a beautiful song, written from the heart. This is why Bruno Mars is different from many other Artists who write love songs :).

I agree with the dream girl theory I think he's saying that whether people believe him or not he's not going to give up on finding love and he believes that there is a girl somewhere in the world who believes the same and though they may not have each other they take comfort in talking to the moon hoping there words someday get to each other and that the other talks back

First let me say this is such a beautiful song! I am in love with Bruno Mars's voice!

For me this song is about someone who's love is separated by distance which keeps them apart. And whether their being apart is due to distance (ie. long distance relationship) or just because they've separated and no longer see each other, it's about that moment when the night is clear and you look up at the stars and the moon. You think of someone you love and you hope that they're looking up at the sky and thinking about you too. Because you know if they are, then they're that much closer to you.

@willowcatherine 















I first heard this song around this time last year, right after I had met this guy on vacation (2,000 miles from home). he and I only had a few weeks together so it was very short lived, but the lyrics fit perfectly once I left. 

Now, however, I've had a change of heart. I lost my best friend in the world (he was my high school sweetheart as well) just last weekend. and every single word fits how I feel. I literally stare up at the sky and talk to him, and just pray and pray he hears me and is talking back, even though I can't hear him. it's a small town so that's about all everyone talks about, and I have more than gone mad on several occasions. 

My interpretation is that he lost someone extremely close to him, whether it be a best friend, a girlfriend, or even a sibling. you could all be right as well though, it could be about a break-up or an ended long distance relationship.

I think this song is so beautiful. It's about a guy longing for a girl he once had. Now all he has is the moon. He stares at in longing for her, talking to the moon in hopes she'll hear him and want him back! I love this song, Bruno Mars is very talented.

I think this song is about a girl he lost because she died or moved far away
""I sit by myself
Talking to the Moon
Try to get to You
In hopes you're on
the other side""

I dont think they necessarily broke up on a bad note, but she left him or just isnt around anymore for whatever reason.

This song was actually writen when the band was traveling through mississippi and the bus broke down and had to wait for the bus to be fixed. so they walked to a gas station and purchased some tall boys and wrote a song about it...im guessing while they were waiting

This is a song describing the author's faith. He wants everyone to know that he is helpless without God and must rely on Him for hope. The author knows he's not alone. 

The rap goes into a beautiful picture of salvation in Christ. The author found himself a passenger in a broken-down hearse (hopeless life). The driver (God) planned a new route, though. A taxi (Jesus) appears, and the author was packed into the back in his coffin. When the author opens the coffin, he sees he's been fighting against his inevitable death, but couldn't get out on his own. When he asks the three men up front (the Trinity) what happened, and they explain what they had done. They assure the author he can hope. He's been freed from his death, his guilt, and his fear.

			Agreed!			

@dmmcd Thank you for this spot-on interpretation!			

The last stanza is really something to marvel at. So much is happening there. I found some really neat imagery in there, all you have to do is dig a little.

""Then there were three men up front""
This represents the three persons of the trinity.

""All I saw were backs of heads""
God shows himself, but not always in the most obvious ways. This line is setting up what is about to happen.

""And then one turned around to say""
Which person of the trinity showed their face? Oh yeah. Its Jesus. Jesus is the nly one to ever come to earth in the human flesh and TELL us the way to heaven. This line is also setting up this next part.

We are going to break up this chunk, but stay with me here.

-1-""We're driving toward the morning sun""
-2-""Where all your blood is washed away""
-3-""And all you did will be undone""

1. Jesus tells us that we are on our way to heaven. He tells us how to get to heaven.
2.This is pretty chilling to me, but the blood of Jesus is talked about a lot in the New Testament. Especially at the crucifixion. It is said that Jesus took away our sins on the cross with his blood.
3.Back to him taking away our sins on the cross.

Twenty One Pilots uses the metaphor of a car in several of their songs. In most of the songs, a car drive is a metaphor for someones life, i think this song is no different.

It sounds like to me that This last part is about him and God.

@theycallmesam9 I completely agree. However, I think ""Where all your blood is washed away"" is coming from the perspecitive of the redeemed person. I believe that its refering to his blood spilt in life through struggles and slips in faith, where God wipes away the pain and suffering.

Man, this song just means everything to me. I'm not religious whatsoever, but it just for me describes my struggles with depression, the night, and starting over. That last line of his rap is just... so powerful for me. I love it so much and I can listen to it on repeat for hours.

@rachel1114 















I agree with much of what others have posted here, but I wonder how many appreciate the allegorical significance of the taxi cab itself. Unlike the hearse, which takes its cargo to a cemetery or crematorium -- or even an ambulance, as some have suggested, which takes a patient to the nearest hospital -- a taxi cab symbolizes true free will: it'll take its passenger wherever he or she wants to go, with no predetermined destination. Of course, the same could be said of a limousine, but a taxi cab -- most especially a ""beautifully PLAIN taxi cab"" -- is affordable by anyone, the common man as well as the rich man. I believe the songwriter is telling us that salvation is a free will choice that's open to everyone.

And to those arguing that the last lines of the rap represent a hospital and/or post-hospital therapy instead of Christian salvation, I respectfully suggest you consider the writer's choice of words more carefully. We go to hospitals to treat our ailments, and we go to therapy to learn how to cope with our lives. But these lyrics describe a more fundamental forgiveness only possible through salvation: having our sins (blood) washed away, and undoing whatever harm we've done.

@rvidil 















Okay honestly, to me this song is like...i can listen ro it as many times as i want without getting bored of it.
In my opinion this song has to do with the religious concepts. Like the three men are the trinity and all he could see were the backs of heads, God presents himself in different ways. The hearse is what carries the coffins to the cemetery and when the three men stole him from his ""fate"" (death, or like hell) they put him in the taxi. Which was his second chance at life, his other way (Jesus).

@Vicky0618 















I really, REALLY don't feel like this song, or any of their songs in general, is about faith or God or any of that feel-good shit.
Everyone knows their songs are primarily about mental struggles and mental illnesses.
So here is my interpretation:
This song is about depression.
The narrator (not necessarily Tyler) is struggling with his feelings about someone, and fighting their own brain in an attempt to be happy for once. ""You're by my side until my dying days"", ""a breathless piece of death made just for you"".
Aforementioned narrator is feeling particularly low, and starts having suicidal thoughts.
The narrator attempts suicide somewhere between Verse 2 and Chorus 2.
Then, the story becomes more interesting.
My colleagues were right here in saying that Verse 3 (aka the rap) is a metaphor.
But it's not about finding faith.
The last verse is a metaphor for the hospital visit and therapy after the attempt.
""We had to steal him from his fate""=saving his/her/their life
""The hearse ran out of gas""=the narrator couldnt go through with the suicide attempt
""A beautifully plain taxi cab""=an ambulance
""Where my fingernails had fought""=the scars from cutting his/her/their wrists
""Someone must have picked the lock""=the narrator felt that someone or something freed him/her/them from their suicidal thoughts
""Morning sun""=a bright and happy future
""Where all your blood is washed away and all you did will be undone""=could refer to the ER or therapy

@Ninjachibi117 I find it hard to believe that you really don't think any of their songs are about faith or God if you have spent much time listening to them, especially their most recent Blurryface album. Each album has songs about  faith. I do agree that this song is more ambiguous than others, and I think your interpretation is interesting. I do think that this song is about Tyler's faith, but I agree that it is written in a way that incorporates depression and maybe it does even parallel a suicidal state of being. 

Back to the faith in their songs thing. I agree that pretty much none of their songs are ""feel-good shit"" faith based in the way that a worship album may be, but in my opinion they are about God. With an open mind, re-listen to""Illicit Demand for Proof"", ""Addict with a Pen"", ""March to the Sea"", ""Doubt"", ""Polarize"", Not Today"", ""Goner"".

I even think that there are references to a faith based struggle with depression in a lot more of their songs, but these are the ones that I think focus more around the theme of wondering where God is in the midst of depression or acknowledging that God exists and trying to reconcile that to whatever the author is feeling.

I say all this as my opinion, so please don't be offended. I do feel strongly about their lyrics though, as I am a Christian and I have experienced the suicide of my mother about 3 years ago. So I find their lyrics very poignant to the way that I find myself feeling towards God or what have you. I would be glad to expand upon why I think some of those songs are about Christianity if you are interested in my opinion.

@Ninjachibi117 @Ninjachibi117 well Tyler is a Christian so it goes without says my that he believes God is what saves us from death. However, that does not exclude the fact that this s By could be about depression as well. I'm pretty sure it is. However, many of the twenty one pilots song a incorporate God in them fairly explicitly and I do think that this song parallels many Christian aspects. So I'm going to have to disagree with the notion that this has nothing to do with religion. For Christians religion is a way of life and it is experienced in every instance so it would make sense for him to incorporate it here. Addict with a Pen, implicit demand for proof, doubt, Holdikg on to you, Trees, Oh ms believer, A car a death a torch, isle of flightless birds, heavydirtysoul, and the judge all have God in them. Also the main point of Christianity is that Jesus died to forgive our sins: to wash away our blood. Just my thoughts

I just don't think his songs are strictly about his faith. I really like the idea of the rap being a suicide attempt- and him finding his way back to sanity- which he needed his faith to do, and relied on that. But I don't think any of his songs were written strictly about his faith. They're not a Christian band, but he does express his faith freely.

No girl, thank u for this song! Congrats to Ariana Grande for releasing a pop song that is basically the anthem for girls who have been in their fair share of failed relationships! Ariana has been in the public eye a lot lately and honestly, I think the world has been waiting for her to make some kind of statement since the death of Mac Miller and since she broke off her engagement to Pete Davidson.  In the song, she says that her ex’s taught her love, patience, and pain and that she turned out amazing because of it. Which honestly is a message I love. This song is setting a great example to a lot of girls out there that it’s important to love yourself, and be in a relationship with yourself, and that you don’t need a man to be amazing. 

I especially love how relatable this song is. Usually, girls tend to bash and hate their ex boyfriends for hurting them but Ariana sends the message that she’s actually thankful for her ex because of how she turned out. Her releasing this song is the best clap back that she could have given to her haters out there that even though she’s been through hell, she’s still on top. Ariana Grande turns lemons into lemonade. I applaud her for her maturity and for her using her voice in an inspirational way.

@AngelXFlowers 















Ariana is bringing us another one of her famous move on and love yourself breakup songs. As in her previous songs, Ariana reminds us that loving ourselves is the most important and that no matter how many failed relationships we have, there will always be a next one. The part of this song that really stands out is the first verse where she takes a moment to thank all of her exes individually for the lessons they taught her. She shows us that having animosity isn't necessary after a breakup, because each relationship teaches us something, even if that person wasn't ""the one."" The entire second verse is dedicated to the reflection inward and how much can be learned from being on our own, too. Ariana continues to cement herself as a queen in the music scene, not only with her female empowerment jams, but also with messages of love and gratitude.

Man I cannot believe nobody has said anything about this song yet, this is crazy. Well alright I guess Ill just tell yall my story cause there's nothin to figure out bout this song. This song means a whole lot to me cause my dad is actually in rehab right now as I right this recovering from alchoholism. Weve tried to stick beside him this whole time but it is the hardest thing in my life to sit there and watch my family destroyed because of this disease addiction. My mom has done a great job for the past say 12 years covering everything and trying to get through this. Hes been through plenty of rehabs but none that actualy worked permanently. Recently before we took him to rehab this time which is hopefully the last I havent had a father. I mean how could I when he wasnt there and the only time i saw him was when he came outta his room to go get beer. And I know this doesnt sound like that bad of a story but for a kid who has to cover up his tracks help his mom cause shes always stressed and then deal with a little brother its been horrible. Its finally coming to an end and I am so thankful. This song just means alot to me cause it reminds me of so much of what we go through. Well i guess thats all I have to say.

""Well, they started talkin bout steps you take

The hearts you break 
And the price you pay ""
For every action there is a reaction and there's always a price you have to pay for decisions that you make.  Made me think a lot. And realize that it's not just me; there's someone out there right now that can stand up and repeat my life word for word, made me feel a little less alone.

This song makes me cry everytime I hear it... My dad and two of my uncles are alcoholics, and we've been trying so hard to get them to stop drinking, for so long now, but they never quit, so it really tears my family apart. I made my uncle listen to this song, hoping that it would get through to him, but it didn't which was suprising because it's such an amazing song and really rings true to his life.

To me, this song is all about how a man's alcohol addiction tore his family apart. He has now admitted and accepted that he has a drinking problem and is seeking help at a 12 step meeting and he wants his ex wife/girlfriend/SO there to support him. Beautiful song.

This song makes me so sad. I was married for 12 years and alcohol completely tore it apart. My wife was one of the most beautiful, sweetest people you could ever know.. when she was sober. Booze turned her into someone I didn't know anymore. She tried hiding it for the longest time, but that only works for a while. The lies and BS that came with drinking just got to be too much. I begged her to get help, and of course an alcoholic's reasoning is that they can quit anytime they want. Well, we split up 4 years ago. I just recently went home to finalize a divorce with her, and it was the first time I had seen her in that 4 years. It is so sad to see what alcohol does to a person. She used to be beautiful and sweet and now... well, things change. Deep down, I know there is still love between us, but as long as she refuses to accept her problem, then there is nothing. I just hope one day she sobers up and realizes what she lost. One step at a time, honey...

It's definitely about a guy going through AA; Most country songs are not that hard to figure out; Leave the difficult lyrics to the rock category! However, I find it rather disturbing that this is the same guy that sings, ""I'm gonna sit right here & have another beer in Mexico"", plus the obscure tracks, ""Tequila Loves Me"" & ""Got a Little Crazy Last Night"".

Okay, uh, look. If you wanna just keep doing the same old thing, maybe this idea is not for you. I for one am not going to compromise my artistic integrity. And I'll tell you something else, this is the show. And we're NOT gonna change it.

Never will I ever utter never to myself
Fall in love with defeat, throw my endeavors on the shelf

Lemonade connoisseur life's lemons coming out

I remember Peabody mice crawling up the shower
Now it's motorbikes, warm nights out in Maui
And white bitches and light skinned women be smilin'
DC star, a PG legend
MoCo phenomenon holmes I'm all of it
Yeah, they all love it though critique Jon Lovitz
And whack hoes hatin' on key out in public
See, welcome to fame where most of us is gon' change
If you never do, still niggas look at you strange
Niggas mostly assume, niggas make up they news
Once you made it you cool, they label you brand new
Really in subconscious
They see a star no longer the underdog
So nobody wanna walk with ya
They all talk like you think you was a god n'shit
But you the same that you always is
Yeah, they all convinced but all for shit
This all be different if you had an office key, yeah
And I'm the same, on e'erything I love, or everything I love

So the more you see, it's few niggas speakin' like me
So they put me in the box with he, and he
And them which is more of a circus than a fair
They work to get there so to work to get theirs
I'll be nothin' but a replica lookin' in the mirror
Respect still there but ya boy's right here
We apples and oranges but everybody pears
They say I'm Lupe, they say I'm Lil' Wayne
They say I'm too Jay to portray new-lay
They say I'm too nice to be a rapper
The prerequisite is gun clappin' so what happened?
They label me a backpackin' nigga on fashion
I laugh at 'em, though Mr. West I ain't mad at ya
See, he in his soul mode, I'm in my go go
Only thing in common is these fuckin' Matsumotos
Yeah live from the SoHo, and hoe told me I'd blow Joe
See I rap like a lifetime blown nose (?)
All I know is I'm merely ??
Meaning I'm lesser than a god but higher up than ya'll

I love this song! It's so true about how a mother thinks of her children... My father is the youngest in his family and my grandma has alzheimer's disease, she doesn't remember a thing and has quite facinating hallucinations but that's beside the point. Yesterday during Christmas my dad was late because he had to work, but all my grandma would say was ""when's mitch getting here, he's coming right""... But she didn't make mention about other members of the family not being there. Part of that is probably that he visits her house everyday to see how her and my grandpa are doing.

When my grandmother on my dads side passed away this song came out around the same time. And i will always remember that because when my dad heard the news and left to Illinois from California to go see her. He was too late she was already in a coma and they to decide then what to do. 

""I got a call in Alabama, said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly.
'Cause your momma really needs you, and says she's got to see you,
She might not make it through the night.""

Thats exactly what happened.... it still makes me cry to this day to see the look on his face when this song comes on the radio.

This song is about a man who can't forget his ex girlfriend.  At the beginning of the song he ""finds a box of memories"" which is easy he finds things in a box that remind him of his ex.  Once he starts remembering, the feelings start flooding in and he must start drinking to try and forget, but the thing is ""her memory is getting the best of him"" causing him to drink. Causing him to get angry ""punching the walls and carrying on like i've gone insane.""

Just a sidenote... Wouldnt ""closing in on my fifteenth year"" actually make her thirteen?
Your fifteenth year is when you are fourteen (like the 18th century is year 1700 to 1799), before turning fifteen and since she is ""closing in"" means she isnt yet, which would make her thirteen? Wrong?
Still, one of his catchiest tunes ever.

			No. First off, nobody thinks like that when they're thinking about age. Second, centuries are labelled like that because there's no Century 0. So the 1st century was 1-99. When people turn 1-year-old, they have literally been alive for 1 year. 12 Months. Someone can be in their first year, when they complete that we cap it off. 1 year old. Then they start on their second year and we cap that off. 2 years old. If someone is closing in on their fifteenth year of being alive, it means they've been alive for 14 years and at most 11 months People figured out this age counting thing awhile ago.

I know this was posted 6 years ago, but seriously...

			I think @Straylite is right. The fifteenth year of someone's life is indeed the one between fourteen and fifteen, so if she's ""closing in on her fifteenth year"", that means she's thirteen going on fourteen. When you turn fifteen you've already completed your fifteenth year.

This one hits home with me, so i understood it from the get go and many of james' songs are about this very upbringing, it's common knowledge he's got daddy issues... however, he never got the chance to get back at his father.

Born to push you around 
You better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh [ daddy is abusive ]
You hit the ground
Mouths so full of lies [ he tells you it won't happen again ]
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting [waiting for the day you can get back at him ]

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes [where he gets revenge]
When you stand up and feel the warmth
but the sunshine never comes
No the sunshine never comes

Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time
God I'll make them pay [ either both parents sucked, or he was bullied ]
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray [ kill him, his blood on your grey life ]

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here [this isn't love, it's abuse]

			I agree			






			I agree			

I like all of the interpretations I've seen. I've been listening to this song a lot likely and for me, it takes a more general perspective on everything I've seen. When I coupled the lyrics with the instruments, it came together for me.

Born to push you around
You better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground
Mouths so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

The idea of ""just stay[ing] down"" when in the eyes of some kind of adversity (someone ""born to push you around"") is of course suppose to be the opposing voice of the songs message. The person goes to hit the ground i.e. having some sort of struggle such as being bullied or maybe failing at what someone aspires to be great at. The ""mouth so full of lies"" could be akin to naysayers surrounding this individuals or even to those trying to console the person saying ""things will get better"" which tends to black your eyes because it doesn't get any better or because the negative things said only hurt you. Classically, this individual is weak and meager and just hopes whatever they are going through will end.

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
but the sunshine never comes
No the sunshine never comes

This individual sits around waiting for the day he will be free of whatever problems he has- the day that never comes, the sunshine that he won't feel because the sun won't come. 

Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time
God I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this gray

This individual has been pushed by whatever problem he has so much that he crawls inside of himself and hides, hoping that one day he can make whoever caused the pain pay for what they did. But again, this is all ""wishful thinking"". He speaks in the future but it has never happened. We see that ""the day that never comes""- the day of redemption- doesn't come because these individuals are sitting back and taking it and not standing up. In a way its about making that day come, not waiting for it.

The music goes from sad, depressed and painful to full of angst, passion and energy as the lyrics come to with 

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison
I suffer this no longer
I put it into
This I swear!
This I swear!
The sun will shine
This I swear!

There is no love because the problem has been overthrown by ""the prison"" (the problem entrapping the individual). He must deal with his problem head on, fully facing it and create his own sunshine because it won't simply come to him. And this individual swears he will break free from his problem and feel that sunshine.

After this, the music becomes immensely powerful and full of passion, the same passion we see during the chorus, but that passion ends and becomes a sad melody again because the individual simply gave up and waited. Now, the power is in full force because the individual had sworn to make change and to take all of the empty promises they had made in the second verse and make them happy.

I believe this song is about standing up and fighting, not sitting back and waiting for the good times to come. You have to make your good times and fight hard and energetically for them- The sun will shine, this I swear.

This song is so powerfully emotional and raw. The lyrics fit the music and the song is a masterpiece and my favorite of the whole album.

Its about his relationship with his penis 

Born to push you around - sex
You better just stay down - uncontrollable erections
You pull away - masturbation
He hits the flesh - masturbation 
You hit the ground - girl kneeling down to give head
Mouths so full of lies - he shoots in her mouth
Tend to black your eyes - skull fucking
Just keep them closed -[legs] 
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth - Cum runs down her legs after sex
but the sun shine never comes - masturbating outside
No the sun shine never comes

This song is supposedly based on Beethoveen's short relationship with his one true love. The meaning is pretty obvious: she's telling him to forget about his worries for now and just spend the night with her.

Very beautifully written and performed, in my opinion.

I adore this song so much.  Don't take for granted what you have because someday it may be gone.  When I get married, I want it to be exactly like this, if being that perfect is possible.

When I hear this song, I think of riding in an old pick up truck with a guy who I was so in love with and his best friend and those two young men just singing their hearts out. It's a song that every generation can appreciate. The young generation is looking forward to all of ""the good stuff"" and the older generations are glad they've lived it.

1106,The Grudge.json,"
Just like schism86 said, i had this post before the site re-vamped...  I'm just gonna copy what I wrote before.. It's hella long, so only read it if your REALLY interested.

First off, sorry this is gonna be so long, I'm gonna disect pretty much every line
Well guys, I'm not here to clear anything up on the meaning of this song, cuz I don't know it for sure.  I like to think my interpretation is right (some of you are probably closer though), but it's open to everyone's views, and I love reading what all of you think.  But anyway, here goes.

I think unlike most songs, Tool is pretty straightforward on this song.  It doesn't seem allegorical, but it is quite deep.   To be honest, after buying lateralus and hearing this song, it became my life motto.  I hate grudges, and I can't stand holding them now.  It just seems so childish.  

I think Maynard is almost throwing the idea of grudge holding back into the faces of people that do it.  He's making fun of them for such a savage thing.  Like the first line... 

""wear the grudge like a crown of negativity"" (go ahead, put your grudge out where everyone can see it, let everyone know that you're mad and that you want to be that way).

""calculate what we will and will not tolerate"" (decide exactly what you want to get mad over that would make you hold a grudge. this way when it happens, you can keep putting that crown back on)

""desperate to control all and everything"" (you don't want to be on good terms.  you WANT the grudge.  if you can control the grudge, you can control the person you hold the grudge against.)

""unable to forgive your scarlet letterman"" (although they know they've done wrong, you won't forgive them under any circumstance)

""clutch it like a cornerstone, otherwise it all comes down"" (clutch the grudge that you hold like a cornerstone, because you know if you don't then the grudge dies. you don't want that)

""justify denials and grip em to the lonesome end"" (come up with excuses to continue holding the grudge, and stand by them until the end, even when everyone hates you for what you're doing, hence lonesome)

""Terrified of being wrong, ultimatum prison cell"" (you're scared to death that someone can prove that you have no reason to hold a grudge.  you worry about it so much you put yourself in your own little prison over it)
[Remember this whole time, I believe Maynard's making fun of the people that do this.  Almost reverse psycology by showing them how stupid it is]

Then I have to agree with 'Insecure Dilusions' idea on the Saturn thing.  Saturn was god of all greek gods.  he was sooo worried he could be overthrown he ate his children.  Yet Zeus was the one thing that Saturn overlooked.  That one thing overthrew Saturn and killed him.  Hang on to the grudge like saturn would, because if you don't you'll be humbled in your ignorance.  And later he says ""ignorant to the damage done""... ignorance isn't stupidity, it's not knowing about something.  in this case, Saturn was ignorant to the damage done to himself until Zeus killed him.

""unable to forgive and we're sinking deeper"" (you won't forgive, and for this you're slowly creating a larger grudge)

The grudge begins to define you, confine you, even control you.

Again to the Saturn reference for almost the rest of the song.  Saying that Saturn, almost as if, takes over your body.  He and you become one, you make the decisions Saturn chose.  And not until you end the grudge will he quit tearing you apart.

Finally Maynard quit's criticizing and simply tells them what they need to do.
Give away the (corner)stone.  Let the oceans take and transmute this cold and weighted anchor (that was your grudge, holding you down).  Give away the stone.  Let the waters take and transmute these leaden (heavy burdensome) grudges into gold.  LET GO.

And thus ends my entirely too long interpretation.  However, this is what I believe and exactly how I feel.  This pretty much explains my life motto.  I thank each of your for your time in reading such a long and drawn out post.  You deserve a pat on the back for putting up with my jabbering.

More than likely that part of the song has to do with Galileo debunking the earth centered concept of the universe. 

Saturn is the most notible celestial object that follows a retrograde motion in the night sky. Makes sort of a circle loop shape. 

This of course proved the fallibility of the church

I still don’t know what’s meant by, “choose 1 or 10” though.

The line “unable to forgive this scarlet letterman” was a book written in 1850 about a woman who had an affair and is forced to wear the red scarlet letter A around her neck.

""...Saturn ascends, Choose one or ten...""

However, when it says

That obviously means Saturn's orbit, and can be another metaphor. 

But the ""...Choose one or ten..."" is very confusing.

@madson4562 Hey! I think your interpretation is spot on. My only speculation is that I personally think this whole thing is directed towards himself, like he is telling himself how ridiculous all of this is, but he still holds this (or these) horrible grudge(s). The reason I think this is because the long (and epic :3) yell at the end of this, sounds like all the anger, anxiety, and desperation built up from this grudge is let out in one long and painful yell. But, I don't know, I think this because when I listen to this song, that's I how I feel, I listen to this song when I am overwhelmed or when I am hating someone, so I can let it all out and remind myself that the grudge is nothing more but pure stupidity

Sorry for the length of this.  It's a paper I wrote in school about the grudge.  Let me know what you guys think.


    Letting go is the sometimes the hardest thing to do in life.  Moving on is hard whether we are facing a death or holding a grudge.  Both circumstances take an emotional toll, but they can be amplified by an unwillingness to let the past rest.  Perhaps the hardest part about situations like these is that the longer we hold on to the past, the stronger its grip is on our lives.  The Grudge, by Tool, is the first song from their album, Lateralus.  Simply defined, a grudge is a “feeling of deep-seated resentment or ill will”. A grudge is more than a surface unwillingness; a grudge takes on a personality, it grows in strength, and it eventually controls our life.  Destruction is the only outcome for someone who cannot escape the deadly grip of a grudge — he has to let go.  
	In the first line, Maynard James Keenan, Tool’s lead singer, describes the grudge as a “crown of negativity”.  Crowns are usually seen as something glorious, brilliant, and beautiful; Keenan takes this symbol of power and authority and twists it into something dark and terrifying, but the idea of power is retained.  He is almost saying we are imbued with some sort of negative power when we allow this grudge to define us.  He goes on to say, “Calculate what we will or will not tolerate/ Desperate to control all and everything”.  With this false sense of power created by a grudge, the person becomes filled with a sense of being able to control everything around them.  Typically, with the presence of a grudge comes a plan for revenge.  A person wearing this crown of negativity is oftentimes so blinded by it they are unable see the limits of their power.  
I believe the next line, “Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen,” is an allusion to Nathaniel Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter.  The antagonist in this book, Roger Chillingworth, is seeking revenge on his ex-wife.  He believes that she has committed an act of adultery against him.  His quest for revenge consumes him so much that it affects his external appearance.  His ex-wife’s lover, Arthur Dimmesdale, dies before Chillingworth is able to exact his revenge.  Chillingworth soon follows him.  His life had become so intertwined with his grudge that they were interdependent.  When the source of power, the target, of his grudge was gone, the life drained out of him.  He died with nothing.  Just like Keenan said in his song, “Clutch it like a cornerstone/otherwise it all comes down/justify denials and grip it to the lonesome end”.  A cornerstone is the source of stability for any building.  It needs to be solid and immovable.  Similarly, a grudge provides stability for a person’s life, no matter how false that stability is.  Friends around us may point out how silly we are, but the holder is blinded by power.  Part of us is, “terrified of being wrong,” as Keenan says.  In the eyes of the holder, if he is found to be wrong, he will be put in an ”ultimatum prison cell”.  
	If the song ended here, we would be without hope — locked away in a prison cell, left to our own devices.  But Keenan tells us, “Saturn ascends/choose one or ten/hang on or be humbled again”.  The reference to Saturn ascending is an astrological idea of changes in life associated with the completion of a revolution by Saturn around the earth.  At this time in life, a choice has to be made.  When he says “one or ten,” I believe he uses this to express to polar opposites.  There is no middle ground; either the grudge is given up or held on to for another period of life.  The one glimmer of hope here is the presence of a choice.  Despite all of the power the grudge has, we can still choose to cast it away.  
	Even though Keenan provides a way for escape, he does not want us to become complacent; he reminds us of the only outcome if we choose to hang on to the grudge.  If we are “wear[ing] the grudge like a crown/desperate to control/unable to forgive,” then we will be “sinking deeper”.  This begs the question, deeper into what?  I believe when a grudge comes to be, it is born out of reason.  We were wronged in some way, but as a grudge lingers in our mind it begins to create a false reality.  The truth we see with our eyes becomes distorted when it passes through the filter of the grudge.  The grudge becomes “defining, confining, [and] controlling”.  Our real self is buried away within our subconscious; seemingly powerless to regain control.  So we continue downward.  
	Then “Saturn comes back around to show you everything”.  Now is the time to make a choice.  This stanza is the first time in the song that Keenan refers to the grudge as a stone.  He says, “[the grudge] drags you down like a stone”.  The other option is to be treated like “a child, light and innocent”.  The process of separating ourselves from the grudge is not easy.  We have to completely humble ourselves to the level of a child.  He is saying there must be a return to innocence; all of the unnecessary weight in life must be eradicated.  All the “[calculations of] what we will or will not tolerate,” and the “[desperations] to control all and everything,” serve only to complicate and fill our life with meaningless pursuits that waste any chance we have of living.  We must be like a child because only a renaissance of innocence will bring freedom from this “cold and fated anchor”.  
	Finally, Keenan begs us to “give away the stone/let the oceans take and transmutate this cold and fated anchor/give away the stone/let the waters kiss and transmutate these leaden grudges into gold”.  His imagery of the oceans and waters is an allusion to baptism.  A thorough cleansing is necessary for change, but with change comes reward.  If this trial in life is endured, then “these leaden grudges will be turned into gold”.  Perseverance breeds greatness. 
	Keenan breaks down in the end of the song.  He lets out a passionate scream — I envision him falling to his knees with his hands on his head.  He knows he must let go, has to let go.  He begins whispering “[l]et go, let go, let go…,” over and over, almost chanting it.  The song crescendos as he chants louder and louder until he is screaming “let go!”  He knows where the grudge is taking him; he sees the destruction waiting for him if he cannot let go.  Change is never easy, but he has to try.  
	A grudge begins in reason but transforms into a powerful entity capable of destroying lives.  The only way to escape the endless spiral of increasing desperation to control everything around us is to choose to change.  No matter how attractive the crown is, we need to take it off.  Maynard James Keenan begs us to throw away “this cold and fated anchor,” but no one can make us let go, it must come from within.  In the end, it is up to us…it always has been.

1107,The Heart Wants What It Wants.json,"
Selena Gomez is ready to wear her heart on her sleeve. ""I have been waiting to share this with all of you,"" the singer tweeted Thursday. ""The video for my new single 'The Heart Wants What It Wants.'""

The black-and-white video opens with a voice recording of Gomez, 22, talking about being wronged by a man, presumably her on-and-off boyfriend Justin Bieber, 20. Fighting back tears and revealing little details, she says, ""When I was on stage and I was thinking of...I felt like I know...I know him, though, and I know his heart and I know what he wouldn't do to hurt me. But I didn't realize that feeling so confident and feeling so great about myself and then [to have] it just be completely shattered by one thing, by something so stupid. But then you make me feel crazy, you make me feel like it's my fault. I was in pain.""

""You got me sippin' on somethin' / I can't compare to nothin' / I've ever known / I'm hopin' / That after this fever I'll survive / I know I'm acting a bit crazy / Strung out, a little bit hazy / Hand over heart, I'm prayin' / That I'm gonna make it out alive,"" Gomez sings. ""The bed's gettin' cold and you're not here / The future that we hold is so unclear / But I'm not alive until you call / And now I bet the odds against it all / Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear / You might be right, but I don't care / There's a million reasons why I should give you up / But the heart wants what it wants / The heart wants what it wants

I think this song is about loving someone that you know is no good for you deep down and yet you want to continue loving them no matter how much it is destroying you in the process. It's about how we each endure spectacular breathless moments and heartbreaking tragedies simultaneously in our pursuits for love. Sometimes the pursuit is in vain, but we secretly cling to the hope that this one will be the lasting love that we have been looking for and that we are deserving of. In the end, you and your love are irreversibly changed either bonding perfectly together or by each developing the strength to love oneself more and walk away.

 This song is about being in love with someone who is toxic and not knowing whether to stay or leave. Like the artist, Selena Gomez, her mind is telling her that he’s bad for her but her heart is saying “stay” She’s describing an emotional pull towards this person. Her significant other is the one guy that she’s drawn to. And no matter what her family and friends tell her

1108,The House That Built Me.json,"
What is it like to leave a place you love, experience life, but realize that you are not fulfilled?  Even more so, what do you do when you return home to rediscover yourself but all you encounter are the memories that echo your brokenness?

Throughout the verses of this song, Miranda introduces the occupant of her old house to its history, while switching to her current struggles in the chorus.  She starts with a brief introduction of the house and then ventures to more specifics once inside.  The climax of the song hits when she realizes that she has done the best she could in life but has managed to lose herself along the way.  Her current attempt to rediscover herself is evident in the visit to her old home.

The great thing about great songs is that they can have different meanings to different people.  Songs can also have varying meanings for the same person, depending on their life stage and point of view.  I find this to be the case with “The House that Built Me.”  When I first heard this song, I thought of when I left home for college and a professional career.  I often thought of what it would be like to go back and if I would find restoration of the sadness that I experienced with leaving home for school.

However, after listening to the song again, I have discovered another meaning that relates loosely to the “Parable of the Prodigal Son” in the Bible (Luke 15:11-31).  This parable describes a son that leaves home, squanders his wealth, experiences heartache and poverty in his attempt to live on his own, and  then eventually returns home to his family.  Similar to the parable, Miranda sings about how “you leave home, you move on, and you do the best you can.”  Like the prodigal son, there was a realization in Miranda’s song about how in doing what she thought was best, she “got lost in this old world” and forgot herself.  In the song, however, she returns to a home occupied by another, and no mention is made of where the family is.  While listeners may not know the specific reasons for leaving, there is a bittersweet perspective given when visiting her old home.  While the prodigal son was able to reconcile with his family, the main character in this song was not as fortunate during her visit. 

This particular view of the song reminded me that there will be a moment when it may be too late to receive restoration in the way we may desire.  There is an appreciation for one’s past and a longing to be made well again, and it is through this that we find an emphasis on not postponing healing.  The song leaves me questioning where will she go after her visit?  What type of healing was she able to experience?  In her taking “nothing but a memory,” did she not find the repair that her heart needed?

			Yeah that's kinda what I love about this song; it doesn't really leave you with the assurance that she found what she was looking for.  It ends on the same bittersweet note that it starts with.  It's depressing in a way, but also kind of cathartic.  It's an outlet for feelings of loss and sadness.  And also I wanted to tell you that that's an interesting connection to the parable of the Prodigal Son that you mentioned.  That's one of my very favorite of Christ's parables in the Bible.

			This song is great and pretty much describes me too and along with are whole family. My siblings, my parents, and I all spent our time in our old house; we all grew up together there. My brother got married, moved out of the house, then we moved to a better house. Then my sister moved out and got married and now I believe it's time for me, which moving on is probably the hardest thing ever for me.

 We had the best dog ever at our old house, but she passed before she could live in our new house. That house I lived in built me and all the things we did there while growing up will be nothing, but a memory.

Then my sister moved out and got married and now I believe it's time for me, which moving on is probably the hardest thing ever for me.

 We had the best dog ever at our old house, but she passed before she could live in our new house. That house I lived in built me and all the things we did there while growing up will be nothing, but a memory.  			

Absolutely love this beautiful song. You can almost see yourself in twenty years time saying the exact same thing to the new owner of your old house. It has a nostalgic tone to it that really touches my heart every time I hear it. I can listen and listen to it and never get tired of it's powerful and emotional words. Did she find what she was searching for? Closure? Fulfillment? I don't know... But I certainly hope she did.

			Awesome song...just so beauitufully written!  The lyrics just speak volumes how I grew up, you love your childhood and I think just deeper meanings into thanking parents or whoever raised you and thanking them and if you could just get one more chance to 'revisit' it to and have that one more memory.  Sometimes I feel that way just looking back to appreciate it all.  Where it is states losing your way sometimes you can feel like that and for me at least I reflect back on how I was raised and that is all I need to make it thru the day.  Great song. Thanks for letting me share my thoughts.

this song truly means alot to me and probly always will be. I had to move away from my old house after my dad past away and it exactly tells how i want to go back and just remember the good times its sad and i cry everytime i listen to and most of my old pets are burried there to.

I love this song because I relate to it. I lived in the same house in Kentucky until I was eleven and it was just a trailer on two acres, and my mama would cut out pictures of Home and Garden Magazine, Southern Living, O Magazine, you name it, and arrange the rooms and she bought books that had blueprints for houses in them and would dream about her ideal home and Daddy did his best to breathe life into it and make that old, silver trailer into a real house. 

I was so young and so free and I was me. I just wish I could go back and be me again, but I've lost myself along the way and I just don't know where I forgot who I am or when I lost what I've been missing, but I just want to knock on the door of my old house and ask to look around and try to find what it is that I've lost. I remember my bedroom was so small and had a funny shape to it, but I just want to go back and run my fingers along the window seal where I nearly broke all my fingers when my brother dropped the window on them when I was three, I want to look under the bed where I hid from monsters when I was six, I want to knock on the hollow spot in the wall Daddy covered with Spackle because the door knob went right through it when I was throwing a fit when I was five. 

I just wish I could pay my respects to my beloved dog, Bingo, one last time, and somehow find what I've lost. I just want to remember again and be myself again. 

Basically, that's what the song is saying and I cry every time I hear it. I hate everyone who does a cover on it because none of them capture the emotion behind it. They think it's a pretty song and move on. They hear the lyrics, but they don't listen. They don't know what she's saying. They can't connect to it, they don't know how it feels to lose something along the way and want so desperately to backtrack and go back to your childhood home and try to find it and just remember. They sing it with a smile on their face, a laugh in their throat. I want to punch them in the face. They just don't understand and they never will.

This song brings tears to my eyes. I interpret it as when you're younger and you aren't as thankful for what you have until it's gone. I think everyone will experience this feeling. When you look back and if you're able to visit it again, it makes you so sad because all the memories come back. What a beautiful song with beautiful meaning.

This is just my personal interpretation from experience.
But when she was young she had the perfect childhood. A family with a mom that had big dreams of a perfect house, that her daddy built them. And she was happy, but at some point it was all broken. Probably just because she grew up, and her parents sold the house (or died?(. But maybe her parents could've divorced, and the house was sold to someone else, and she lost that perfect childhood. So now she's tried doing everything to move on and become something new, to fix that broken feeling. But no matter what she can't, because that childhood was a huge part of her life, even if it's not herself anymore..

			That's a saying.  It just means that she's now a stranger to whoever's living in her old house.  And that's funny that you compared this song to ""American Honey"", because I've thought for awhile that the two songs have some similar qualities.  ""American Honey"" is a little happier than this one though.

I absolutely love this song. Miranda's voice is almost angelic the way she shows the heartbreak in a song. 
I agree with everyone, though I do have my own thoughts on it. I get that she wants to go back home to all the memories, and the good times. But why? I think because maybe, she's taken her new life a little for granted. Maybe she feels that she needs a reality check and she knew that seeing everything from her past would help that. Remind her who she is and where she came from. What do you think?

1109,The King for a 1000 Years.json,"
I think he's talking about drugs in this song. The 'line' that he mentions in this song and other songs could be a line of cocaine or something similar. He says he was a king under its control because of how it made him feel so in control of everything and it gave him so much power in his head, but he knows it's also destroying him and he wants to stop using it. He says 'All that I've compromised to feel another high' shows that he knows the consequences of whatever drug it is but he compromises that to 'feel another high'. The dreams mentioned in the lyrics 'I dreamed you dreamed of me' could also be drug induced. 'Is it worth the price' can show the cost of drugs. 'I need to feel like you've let me go' shows how he wants to move on from it but he can't because of the addiction. 'I've had to break myself to carry on' and 'They say it's easy to leave you behind, I don't want to try' could show how difficult it is to quit once you start using drugs, because of the withdrawal and difficulty to function normally. Most people say this song is about an abusive or destructive relationship which could also be true, but I think that the lyrics can be taken more literally. A lot of Y

I agree, the song does have wonderful flow.

At first, I thought the song refered to the anti-Christ ruling for Satan, but that isn't the case as that the anti-Christ will rule for 7 years, and Jesus will rule for 1000 following that, and I kind of doubt that Jesus is intended to be the 'evil king'. That said, I imagine this is simply an original fantasy concept meant to tie-in with the loose concept of the keeper of the seven keys (there isn't really an actual plot line, as far as I can tell, just loose references here and there). Doesn't matter though, because it's still a great song.

I'm pretty sure this song is about the Third Reich, AKA Nazi Germany ruled by Adolf Hitler. Why? Just look:

""Forgotten in his reich of shadows""

Reich - pretty obvious; there are English words with the same meaning but still they used German word. 

""The lord of the evil""

So we have evil dude... most people see Hitler as one of the vilest individuals in the human history.

""A puppet on a string""

While Hitler was more than a puppet, his 'trusted' advisors and military leaders held a lot of power. They just needed his charisma to inspire common people to fight and die.

""For a thousand years""

Hitler promised that Third Reich will last for 1000 years.

Later in the song there are multiple of references to annihilation, executions, fear, greed, hate and obsession - all of these fit the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler perfectly.

I think it's the aftermath of the song ""Keepers Of Seven Keys""
When the keeper locks the last sea and dethrone the Devil, and defeated he tries to Trick or even conquer him with his offer of power. 
And the keeper denny the devil and stand still on your promise.

For real, the evidence that the devil calls the keeper of brother makes me think that in real... The keeper its not Jesus...
THE KEEPER CAN BE OR MICHAEL OR GABRIEL!

							Agree! Of course, this is a love song. Unrequited love. It's like they know each other for a long time. And he's been trying to have her heart. But she never realizes that or never wants to take the relationship further than being ""just friends"".  He's deeply in love, but she never embraces it.

One of the most beautiful and most timeless ballads ever.And one that can hold a deep personal meaning for each listener(in my opinion).

I always think of the 'door' as being somewhat symbolic of someone's heart and the long and winding road as both geographic and symbolic of the long road to gain or regain someone's trust(heart).The singer may have once held the other person's heart(door)or was on the road to doing so,but was 'left standing there',and through all their wanderings they are still 'led back' because despite the door(heart)being so hard to reach it was still the one door(heart)they knew would open to them.

'The wild and windy night
that the rain washed away
has left a pool of tears
crying for the day'
To me this symbolizes some turmoil or other that even once seemingly overcame has left an emptiness and need,that can only be filled by reaching the end of the long winding road and the door/heart though the singer is uncertain he/she will ever get there.The theme throughout the song is uncertainty,will the road ever finally end,and where?
Though definitely a love song,I feel it's very different than the typical love song in the sense that it's about finally knowing who you should be with yet the road there is still difficult.

Technically weezer, this isn't the Beatles last album.  Abbey Road is.  The disappointment and despair of the Get Back sessions led the Beatles to try and attempt one more album before they broke up, which was Abbey Road.  Let It Be came out after Abbey Road though because a different producer was working with Let It Be and he just screwed it all up, especially on the overdubbing of the Long and Winding Road.

The song is inspired by the road down the Kintyre peninsula of Scotland to Paul's home (still owns it) in Machrihanish where Paul retreated to get away from mayhem of the Beatles.  The road is long but it isn't as winding as the song suggests - it's fairly straight in most places. There are actually two roads to his place - the coastal road takes a little longer to drive but the ocean views are indescribably beautiful. Definitely a bit of a nowheresville down there even today but very pretty.

@erasmus11290 the George Michael version blows either version out of the water			

Yes, the song appears to be about the Beatles & many things that was going on in the Beatles life at the time must have inspired it.. I cant disagree BUT there is also a much deeper level of understanding in this song.. it is about one's relationship to GOD

I used to listen to it, it made me emotional & i thought it was a love song ( it matched how I felt about frustrating romances) & other times i thought it is a song about some unattainable goal that has a long & winding road to reach it 9it matched how i felt about my career that never got any better or never moved any further)

BUT then ONE DAY it hit me when i was having one of those spiritual ups & downs.. I was literally & desperately crying out to God for help & this song began to play at the same time & oh my God... this was it.. i got what it is all about

IT IS ABOUT THE LONG & WINING ROAD TO GOD & BACK FROM GOD THROUGHOUT ALL OF ETERNITY... this road has no beginning & has no end.. it always is.... You are one with God but then you separate (this separation is only an illusion) when you are born into a new body & then you return to God when you die & become one again... & this keeps going on & going on for eternity.....

when you cry out & suffer is when are under the illusion that you are separate from God & that you are on an endless & tiring road to God but the peace comes in when you realize that in ultimate reality you are never separate from God & you are never on a road to God becuase you are with GOD always & all ways

@bananamama 















this song is absolutely beautiful.
i think another interpretation of this song is that sometimes one may find the person that they are meant to be with, but due to other circumstances, they are somewhat rejected from having a long term relationship with that person.
anyhow---so i think that this song talks about how you never let go of that one person, no matter how many others your with or what happens with your life. your mind leads you back or ""takes you back down the road"" to that one ""home"" that you found in that certain person.

McCartney: I was a bit flipped out and tripped out at that time. It’s a sad song because it’s all about the unattainable; the door you never quite reach. This is the road that you never get to the end of.

McCartney: I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.

McCartney: It’s rather a sad song. I like writing sad songs, it’s a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It’s a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.

Martin: That made me angry - and it made Paul even angrier, because neither he nor I knew about it till it had been done. It happened behind our backs because it was done when Allen Klein was running John. He’d organized Phil Spector and I think George and Ringo had gone along with it. They’d actually made an arrangement with EMI and said, ‘This is going to be our record.’

Martin: EMI came to me and said, ‘You made this record originally but we can’t have your name on it.’ I asked them why not and they said: ‘Well, you didn’t produce the final thing.’ I said, ‘I produced the original and what you should do is have a credit saying: “Produced by George Martin, over-produced by Phil Spector”.’ They didn’t think that was a good idea.

			According to the Beatles Interview Database 2004, Beatles producer George Martin said Phil Spector's ""overproduced remix"" was ""uncharacteristic"" of the Beatles. According to songwriter Paul McCartney, his ""long and winding road"" was inspired by B842, a thirty-one mile (50 km) road in Scotland that winds along the east coast of Kintyre into Campbeltown, and part of the eighty-two mile (133 km) drive from Lochgilphead.[6] In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric as ""a rather sad song. I like writing sad songs, it's a good bag to get into because you can actually acknowledge some deeper feelings of your own and put them in it. It's a good vehicle, it saves having to go to a psychiatrist.""

Nevertheless, the Spector version went on to become the group's twentieth and final US #1 hit.

I don't know how this one could have gotten past me, but I just discovered this song. I guess everyone else already knew this, but clearly one of the master works of the era, and the amazing cover by Cash will likely seal it as an all-time classic. I want to share some of my thoughts about this song, but I don’t have time to write this as well as I’d like. Please forgive its excessive length. 

First, a note on the music. It's very unusual for a song from the rock tradition. No verse course arrangement, just a building repetition, interrupted early in the song by narration in the same voice. Clearly a product of its time, the studio version is produced as an “alternative” cut with a pretty typical post-punk sound. It’s almost like no one quite knew what to do with this song, including, one assumes, Cave himself. It takes a few listens for it to sink in that there is something much deeper going  on here than the style initially suggests. In later, live versions, Cave seems to have come to grips with exactly what he has here and performs it in a more fitting way. That’s not to take anything away from the studio version. The kind of weird juxtaposition of substance and style make it something that you have to discover and lets you go deeper into the song with repeated listens. The work it takes to pick through the pop veneer makes you appreciate your discovery that much more.

The construction of the song has a great trick that is remarkably effective. The chord progression itself is wonderful, but it’s eight measures long, and seven of them build a tension that is only briefly resolved by the eighth before it immediately returns to uneasiness. It makes the whole song feel incredibly intense and unrelenting, which is analogues to the subject: a man on death row awaiting the electric char. 

Which brings us to the lyric. There have been great song writers whose lyrics stand alone as poetic statement, but this has to be one of the best bits of poetry in its own right released on a rock record. It’s possible that I want it to be even better than it obviously is, but I read a little more into it than some. In the beginning monologue he proclaims his innocence, or at least sort of. “Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know”. Later he talks about his hands and fingers, one evil and one good, of which he observes “That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist”. As if to proclaim his innocence, blaming the whole incident on these filthy five fingers. Tellingly, it is the “kill-hand” that “Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D.” He calls the ring “a long-suffering shackle collaring all that rebel blood”. 

I read all of that to give an ambiguous meaning to guilt or innocence. A man, maybe not cut out of the same cloth as everyone else, doing his best to live as society dictates but finding himself unable to live up to the expectations. It’s a cognitive dissonance that eventually plays out in murder, but a murder this complex man does not blame himself for. This is a character that lives uncomfortably in a world not of his making. And as such, death can almost be welcome, a sentiment repeated throughout the song.

The middle verses about Jesus are the key to the whole thing, I think. He notes the irony that Christ was born and then, after making a life as a carpenter, he is crucified on a work of carpentry. He paints, quickly, a view of Jesus as another character who wasn’t able to live as others expected and ultimately met the same fate he himself awaits. He then goes on to further identify himself as a Christ figure by noting that He now sits on his heavenly throne, but down here it’s made of wood and wire, an obvious reference to the electric chair he will soon take his seat in.

But what to make of that last line: “But I’m afraid I told a lie.” I don’t think this is a confession of guilt. That’s already happened, really. We know he did it, and we know he did it for no reason anyone else could call “motive”. So what’s the lie? I think there’s a clue in the verse structure. The line comes in the same resolve measure that’s repeatedly told us “I’m not afraid to die”. A man who has lived his life with conflicting thoughts once again has to face the fact that what he’s told himself to be true may not be. As he climbs into what he’s convinced himself is the mercy seat, he realizes that he actually is afraid. 

Weather he means it the way I hear it or not, it’s difficult to argue that this song is anything but brilliant. Clearly one of the best songs of the era, maybe one of the best rock songs ever. As an observation at the end of a review about a song that deals with death, I’d say this to Nick Cave. Walk through life confidant that, in a world of mortal men, you have made a mark that transcends mortality. A true masterpiece that will leave a strong legacy.

Great work all. Cave is a master of metaphor and it is good to see so many people care about what he is actually trying to say.

While there are many themes in the song, the predominant one uses guilt and innocence to explore the objectivity of truth. In this regard it is greatly influenced by books such as ""The Outsider"" and Crime and punishment. The ""I begin to chill to objects and their fields"" line is taken straight from Dostoevsky.

From our characters view, having denounced mans right to judge him, God is the paradigm of truth, and the song explores the implications of such belief with great depth and subtle precision.
The uncertainty of his actions and and as such why he would commit them if they were wrong or unjust, leads to the analogies with Jesus, who is the ultimate victim of his own fate. 
 It is fitting that as the song begins to reach it's climax and his disdain becomes bolder that he picks the wedding band, a symbol of Gods holiest institution on earth, as the shackle of his rebel blood, life and spirit, which is suggestive of a truth he can't explore, indicating the fallacy of his God.

The last line ""I'm afraid I told a lie"" is not a submission of guilt, it simply sums up a fearful yet enduring uncertainty on all matters, as he is not sure of guilt or innocence or god or truth or any other yardsticks, right or ability, to measure his supposed crime.

Cash's version is of a different flavor, his emphasis put on haunting nobility, a beat prince trudging towards a destined fate in almost heroic fashion, while Cage focuses on the subjective, with dark, all too human, undertones creeping through the prose. Which makes it, lyrically at least, a far more interesting work.

			great post, i didn't realise there was a 2nd page when writing mine. Yours has, i believe, far more insight than mine. I can definitely see the comparisons and similarities to ""the outsider"". 			

I must say that this song confirmes that nothing is black or white. How can anyone see what is good and what is bad, when we twist it all. So many people has died on a chair, or soo, and ho's to blame for it? Their blood is on our hands. We are no better! Just a bunch of a hypocrites. Can't we learn on a cilling Jeasus. No! There was a lot of ""Jesuses"" throughout the history.  
So, whay would killer believed our judgment, and accepted that he is guilty? 
Just in a moment of death, when he's alone with God and freed from all delusions of a mankind, he realises what he truly has done.
Just my opinion.
Great song!!!

			I donÂ´t agree with you on the last line. He truly believes he, at the very least, had an excuse to commit this crime, as confirmed by the ""of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know"". Also, there is no mention of him feeling guilty in the lyrics. No, I firmly believe the lie he is talking about is when he keeps saying heÂ´s not afraid to die.

well, i agree with that interpretation, but not wholly.

i think that in the last few moments of his life he doesn't know whether he's innocent or not.

if he did it, he's told himself so strongly that he was innocent, that it's hard to accept guilt.

and if he didn't, he's been told so frequently that this is why he's being murdered. this is his punishment.

there is proof, not enough. 
but could i have done it and blocked it out? my EVIL hand wears a wedding band called GOOD. 
is it hiding it's true self?

did he do it?
i think it's all interpretation.

in all i think this is internal conflict for him: what is the truth?

Forget about the context for a moment.  The song is about fear of death and the uncertainty surrounding the gray areas of truth and morality that all of us wrestle with, not just those on death row.  ""Am I a good person?  Did I live a good life?""

Mercy Seat isn't so cut and dry.  Everyone wants to know: Did he get executed for a crime he didn't commit?

Of course not.  With the lyrics as a weak defense case, we see a stubborn murderer using his final breaths trying reconcile the bitter life he had.  

When you're jailed and stripped of your freedom, you begin turn into the victim you murdered.

The song is about how one is always haunted by their incidents of bad karma.

""My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L.
Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D.
Tis a long-suffering shackle
Collaring all that rebel blood""

""Kill-hand"" may be a poker reference - under some rulesets in which the game is short but the stakes are high - but here I think it's simply a colourful name for his right hand, the one which would wield a weapon. 

The E.V.I.L. / G.O.O.D. probably refers to knuckle tattoos, often sported by prisoners. That he's on death row would indicate he's had these applied during a former stretch in general population.

Wedding band would mean good and evil are inextricably linked, and the good balances the evil & somehow restrains it from getting (excuse the pun) out of hand. The lines following would support this idea.

			A point about those tattoos.  They are directly influenced by the 1955 film 'Night Of The Hunter', which was the only film ever directed by the great actor Charles Laughton.  In this film, Robert Mitchum plays a psychotic preacher who has 'LOVE' and 'HATE' tattooed on his knuckles.  He uses the tattoos to illustrate the constant fight that good and evil are engaged in in every soul.  By extension, the tattoos also reveal the struggle between the pious Christian preacher and the callous killer that both reside within his own soul.  The film disturbingly notes that these two sides may not be as far apart as they initially seem....

Cave is very culturally literate, and has scripted a number of films himself.  I'm sure he had this film in mind when he wrote these lines.

This is one of Nick's many songs built around a story, although this one isn't as immediately clear as some of his others. 

It concerns a killer, though exactly what he did isn't explained. He's convicted and sentenced to death, all the while claiming he didn't do it. While on Death Row, he discovers Christianity, and in his final few moments before dying, he confesses (to himself, and to God) that he is guilty of it after all. The Mercy Seat of the title is a reference to the throne of God, and also to the electric chair.

I believe this song is just about Eminem's life as an artist. ""Call me crazy, but i have this vision, one day that ill walk amougst you, regular civilians."" Hes say that he believes that one day he be a normal person and not have to deal with the negitive things of being famous. ""I aint here to save the f**king children, but if one kid out of a hundred million, who are going through a struggle, feels and relates, thats great"" he is saying that he is not writing songs that are for children to relate too, but if there are children, that are going through rough times, that listen to some of his songs to relieve some of their frustrations, then he thinks thats great. ""Im friends with the monster thats under my bed."" Hes is speaking about slim shady, which is his vulgar alter ego. How he is friends with his alter ego, the""monster"". ""Maybe i need a straightjacket, face the facts, im nuts for real, but im okay with that, its nothing."" He his refering to his alter egos video ""my name is"" where he is wearing a straightjacket. He saying that he is really that weird and that he is okay with being that way, cause it doesnt affect him as a person, that he will countiue to be friends with his alter ego, slim shady, his monster, so he will continue to make some vulgar songs that slim shady creates.

I feel like the person is damaged to some extent, possibly from past experiences or failures and is regretting that. The person claims to be ""friends with the monster under their bed,"" the opposite of normal reactions to a thought of that situation. Same with listening to the ""voices"" inside of their head. They reference a person or figure attempting to help them sort their life out and they block this person out. Hopefully anyone that feels they can relate eventually sorts their problems out! There are several references to famous figures in this as well, which add to the uniqueness of the song as well. One of Eminem's more laid-back songs, which I find to be a breath of fresh air from an artist like him.

@SaveTheDay 















Here you go, the original lyrics, whatever is on here is what people think they heard. This is what they actually sing :

I’m friends with the monster that’s under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You’re tryin’ to save me, stop holdin’ your breath
And you think I’m crazy yeah, you think I’m crazy

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can’t be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wantin’ my cake and eat it too and wantin’ it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cuz my ego inflated when I blew, see
But it was confusing, ‘cuz all I wanted to do’s be
The Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when blew steam
Whoo, hit the lottery ooh-wee
But with, what I gave up to get it was bittersweet it was like winnin’ a used mink
Ironic ‘cuz I think I’m getting’ so huge I need a shrink, I’m beginnin’ to lose sleep
One sheep, two sheep, goin’ coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I’m actually weirder than you think
(Cuz I’m..) 

I’m friends with the monster that’s under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You’re tryin to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I’m crazy, yeah you think I’m crazy
Well that’s nothin’, well that’s nothin’

Now I ain’t much of a poet but somebody once told me to seize the moment and don’t squander it
Cuz you never know when it could all be over tomorrow so I keep conjurin’
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah ponderin’ll do you wonders no wonder your losin’ your mind the way it wanders ,yodalodaleheehoo, I think it went wanderin’ off down yonder and
Stumbled on ‘ta Jeff VanVonderen, ‘cuz I need a interventionist, to
intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
’Cuz the very thing that I love’s killin’ me and I can’t conquer it
My OCD’s conkin’ me in the head keep knockin’
Nobody’s home I’m sleepwalkin’
I’m just relayin’ what the voice in my head’s sayin’, don’t shoot the messenger
I’m just friends with the..

I’m friends with the monster that’s under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You’re tryin to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I’m crazy, yeah you think I’m crazy
Well that’s nothin’, well that’s nothin’

Call me crazy but I have this vision
One day that, I’ll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I’m
Comin’ straight at MC’s blood gets spilled and I’ll
Take you back to the days that I’d get on a Dre track, give every kid who got played that, pumped up feelin’
And shit to say back to the kids who played him, I ain’t here save the fuckin’ children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin’ through a struggle feels it and
Relates that’s great, it’s payback, Russell Wilson
Fallin’ way back in the draft turn nothin’ into somethin still can
Make that straw into gold chump, I will spin, Rumpelstiltskin
In a haystack, maybe I need a straightjacket face facts, I am nuts for real, but
I’m ok with that, it’s nuthin’ I’m still friends
With the...

I’m friends with the monster that’s under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You’re tryin to save me stop holding your breath
And you think I’m crazy yeah you think I’m crazy...
I’m friends with the monster that’s under my bed

This song has to be about vampires.....kinda like an Edward and Bella situation. Think about it:

""Yeah I'm a monster but I'm no Frankenstein"" 
""You go 'bout your day baby while I hide from the sun"" 
""If you knew what I was you's would run and hide""
""We would live forever. Who could ask for more. You could die if you wanted. But baby what for?""

It's about a guy asking a girl to ""go into the night"" and become a vampire. lac6589 is right. It has to be in the new twilight or a movie that rips off twilight

Actually when I first heard this song I thought it was about vampires, mainly Twilight as well... but when I really thought about the song I realized it can relate to real people too - Psychopaths. Not the stereotypical psychopaths, either.

@BomNZ How r u now? What is that feeling like, I wonder?			

Yeah I'm also pretty sure it's about drugs or something similar related to seedy nightlife, maybe also a mental issue.  It's left open so it can fit your particular vice!

I think it would be perfect in Twilight or another similar vampire movie though!

However, I do think it was written about drugs or related psychosis.

""I'm complicated/you're as straight as they come""
I have issues; you don't partake in any vices, but I have tons.  (""straight"" also refers to someone who doesn't party/do drugs.  this usage was more popular before the word took on the meaning of heterosexuality.  bruno mars has an old school vocabulary, so it makes sense that he would use ""straight"" to mean someone who refrains from drugs.)

""I hide from the sun"" doesn't have to refer to vampires.  It can refer to seedy nightlife.  He goes out at night because that's when all the bad stuff happens, all the parties.  I myself hide from the sun, and even though I'm pale, I'm not a vampire.  I'm just a miscreant who prefers the night.

""you won't know what it's like until you try""
suggests that it is a particular activity of some sort.  of course this line is great for a vampire parallel.  good for breaking dawn especially.

""cross the LINE""  coke reference?  it's stretching it, i dunno.  otherwise it could be more general, because once you try something you're stuck and corrupted, kind of like drug virginity (lol that sounds so stupid)

""If they say life's a dream
call this insomnia""
lucidity that can be related to drugs, but also any other nightmare of a life, so any major problem.

""'Cause this ain't Wonderland
it damn sure ain't Narnia""
you can't talk about wonderland without drugs.  it's alluding to tripping into an alternate universe, but it's not so great because they have lots of problems.  like using a drug to run away from all your issues.  the fact that it ISN'T is part of a theme throughout the song of something painfully ordinary.  he can't escape from the reality of his own life, no matter how hard he tries.  similar to ""i'm a monster/but i'm no frankenstein"" which of course counters the idea that it's about twilight.
it's saying that the speaker is a real person. ""i'm a monster"" because he has these problems/addiction, but frankenstein represents the supernatural, and I think a lot of this song is consciously going the other direction, about some serious real life problem, and, as i said, the desire to escape but inability to do so completely.  however, this can get twilighty if you want, because twilight makes vampires very ordinary. so...

i wonder if that made sense.  to be honest i'm just procrastinating doing my homework, that's why i gave such a long analysis.

			YES!! I agree completely with your analysis. I think it really is about drugs or related psychosis. Perhaps he knows, deep inside, that he has a problem, but he is still a human being. ""I'm a monster, but I'm no frankenstein""..... maybe he feels like a ""monster"" (or just an out of control human) with this addiction, but he knows he's no ""frankenstein"", meaning he's not freak or threat or wretched human being. I hope that makes sense. 

I also understand the psychopathy theory. I often feel unstable in that sense and can actually wrap my mind around the song in that sense.

I'd also like to point out two more things.  haha.

1.For the twilight interpretation people, I noticed something kind of cool:
In the beginning it sounds like a wolf howl in the background if you listen closely.

2.There are three vocalists on this track, all of whom probably wrote their own verses, so it's very probable that each one took the general idea in slightly different directions that all go together in a way.  which is pretty neat.

I think you could apply this to someone who is gay and wanting someone who isn't, maybe that straight person is a close friend.

Truth of the matter is, I'm complicated (i'm gay)
You're as straight as they come (you are straight . . .)
You go 'bout your day (without being judged for who you are)
while i hide from the sun (because 'coming out' would hurt)

It's better if you don't understand
'cause you won't know what it's like
until you try (try, to be gay with me)

you know I, i'll be waiting on the other side (I'm gay | You are straight)
and you, all gotta do is cross the line (come be gay with me)
I could wait a whole lifetime
but you gotta decide (between straight or gay)
you know I, i'll be waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side (I'm gay | You are straight)

we could live forever
who could ask for more
you could die if you wanted (face all the hate with me)
but baby what for (it's too much for you to handle)


It's better if you don't understand (i wouldn't want you to get hurt)
'cause you won't know what it's like (it would be to real for you to handle)
until you try (unless you try to be gay with me)

you know I, i'll be waiting on the other side (I'm gay | You are straight)
and you, all gotta do is cross the line (come be gay with me)
I could wait a whole lifetime
but you gotta decide (between straight or gay)
you know I, i'll be waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side (I'm gay | You are straight)

If they say life's a dream
call this insomnia
'cause this ain't wonderland
it damn sure ain't narnia
and once you cross the line (to be gay with me)
you can't change your mind (once your gay, you're gay)
yeah i'm a monster (by the rest of society's standards)
but i'm no no Frankenstein
and quite frankly
i've been feeling insane in between my eyes
i really can't explain what i feel inside (being gay is natural)
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide (if you knew if i was gay, would we still be the same?)
Many have tried to go into the night (hide in the closet, it's dark as night in here)
cross over the line and come back alive (open the door, and be free, be alive)
but that's the price we pay when we living on the other side (it hurts to be gay)


you know I, i'll be waiting on the other side (I'm gay | You are straight)
and you, all gotta do is cross the line (come be gay with me)
I could wait a whole lifetime
but you gotta decide (between straight or gay)
you know I, i'll be waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side (I'm gay | You are straight)

(it's better to not cross, you won't get hurt)
it's better if you don't understand 
it's better if you don't understand
it's better if you don't understand
it's better if you don't understand
it's better if you don't understand

			It's most definitely about Vampires. Welcome to the Twilight era!

""You go 'bout your day baby while I hide from the sun."" - Most common vampire lore says that sunlight can kill or atleast seriously harm a vampire, causing them to need to hide from the sun.

""We would live forever who could ask for more? You could die if you wanted but baby what for?"" - Vampires are supposed to be immortal.

Also if you listen close enough, you can hear some wolves in the background at the beginning, which sort of supports the werewolf, twilight, idea.

The day after Cliff died, James completely destroyed his hotel room and among the things he destroyed was an alarm clock. He also got drunk and was out in the street screaming Cliff's name, asking where he was and wishing he had been the one who died. ""I'd rather die behind the wheel"" - behind the wheel of the bus - in the back of the bus, in one of the bunks - is where Cliff was laying when the bus flipped, hurling him out the window and being crushed.

I'm just glad I got to see him live when they opened for Ozzy...awesome bass player.

@Lowman great view of the song. Thanks			

ive heard a lot of different meanings for this song but here is the one that hear a lot and read newsted talk about:
its about the band losing cliff burton..and not knowing how to move on from there..and knowing that theyd give anything to have him back..and hoping that they can move on and not feel the pain of cliff dying forever

also, the lyrics were written by the entire band..and newsted did most of the musical arrangment (yay)

After reading all of your thoughts, I've discovered that I know nothing of the subject matter. But could I possibly throw in something new?  The songs title caught my eye. ""The Outlaw of Torn"" is a historical novel written by Edgar Rice Burroughs around 1914. The meanings you've come up with are present in the character Norman of Torn. It is a short story and could add to the complexity of this song. I am convinced that it has some bearing.

Okay so this outlaw meets this girl and she totally changes him for the better but then she left him or he left her, I can't remember which.  But then he now searches for her because he loves her and what not but he'll never find her, she's long long long gone.  Happen to you?

Its actually

""I'm Outlaw Torn""

If you have seen the S&M live video, he clearly says- ""I'm Outlaw Torn"" -

NOT-""Outlaw of Torn""-NOT


I think it's more he's looking to hurt/kill the person who took his love away.

"
1121,The Pantaloon.json,"
Your grandpa died
When you were nine
They said he had
Lost his mind
You have learned
Way too soon
You should never trust the pantaloon

Pantaloon is a character from a classic play/pantomine called Harlequinade. The other characters are Harlequin, Pierrot, Columbine, and Clown. Pantaloon is greedy, wealthy, and old. His role in the act is his attempt to keep the lovers Harlequin and Columbine apart. This is just some background information, but basically, all you need to know, is that Pantaloon refers to an old man. Indeed, Shakespeare used ""Pantaloon"" as a metonymy for old man.

The intro to the song is an intro to the main character, who lost his grandpa when he was nine. The grandpa is the ""pantaloon"" in this case, but why did the grandfather's death cause the boy to distrust the elderly? Likely because the the old man ""lost his mind."" Growing forgetful, generally declining cognitively. As a young boy, (and for anyone), this is scary and confusing to witness.

Now it's your turn
To be alone
Find a wife
And build yourself a home
You have learned
Way too soon
That your dad is now a pantaloon

The boy grows up, has kids, and now realizes that his own father is growing old. He has just moved into his house, and suddenly realizes that his dad's mental state is going downhill. This is a shock, and it seems to have come ""way too soon.""

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

This part is speaking directly to the pantaloon/old man. Exhaustion and pain have become a part of their everyday life. The hole in the shirt represents a general decay of how things once were. ""And all your friends fertilize the ground you walk"". This line reveals that the old man's friends are dead, fertilizing the ground. In other words, they're pushing up daisies. With the exhaustion, pain, decay, and loss, it's no wonder that they start to ""lose their mind,"" to slip away rather than deal with the sadness of life.

He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air
How he used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now,
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a pantaloon

This rap verse discusses the life of the old man, who is likely the dad referred to in the second verse. The staredowns between the sun and the moon refer to the passage of time. He also used to be a worker at the fair, likely selling something: ""hustling people.""

The old man has ""been around so long"" that he perceives a chair differently than most people. To him, it's like a ""tiny island,"" that provides him a much-needed rest. It's his refuge, and yet it isolates him from others, who still ""glide across"" the sea.

""The end can't come soon enough, but is it too soon?"" This is the most powerful line in the song to me. Is it too early for the old man to die? Or would death be a mercy that would end his suffering? There's really no answer to this question.

You like to sleep alone
It's colder than you know
Cause your skin is so
Used to colder bones
It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmare and your frights

This last verse primarily discusses the sad state of the old man. He's lonely. He's cold to the bone. His fears are the only thing ""holding his bones together,"" or keeping him alive. However, some hope may be offered: ""It's warmer in the morning than what it is at night."" The man's life is approaching its later hours, and will soon be over. But the end of the day does not mean the end of the man's existence. After death, there will be warmth. I think this is referring to heaven.

Well, there it is: It's a song about people growing old, growing crazy, and dying.

@todd127638  - Great explanation!			

@todd127638 This one definitely sounds right!			

From my understanding, ""pantaloon"" is an Italian term referring to a crazy old guy. This is basically about how his grandfather and immediate father went insane from old age and how he's destined to follow in their footsteps. 

""Now it's your turn to be alone, find a wife and build yourself a home.""
This is referring to how even if you have a wife and home it won't stop you from going insane and feeling alone because you live in your own little world.

It seems as if he made every effort to avoid becoming a ""pantaloon"" by isolating himself to begin with. The part that talks about his friends fertilizing the ground and how a chair is a tiny island, is a reference to everyone around him starting families while he slowly becomes the ""pantaloon.""

This is just my interpretation, don't take anything I said for doctrine.

@WinstonChurch Pantaloon is actually a character in Italy who wears pantaloons (which are like tights for men).			






@WinstonChurch Pantaloon is actually a character in Italy who wears pantaloons (which are like tights for men).			

A very simple explanation to the song (using a lyric site who's owner said he met tyler and got the meaning) is ""the pantaloon"" is means death. So basically the person in the songs father and grandfather died and now it's HIS turn. And personally what I think when he says ""now your friends fertilize the ground you walk"" basically means all of your friends are dying and now its his turn. You can easily see why he's losing his mind, when everyone around him is dying and he realizes that he is next.

@ZebrasWithRye 















Ok, this is what I think it's about. 

Pantaloon is basically another word for ""Pants."" In a metaphorical sense, Pants refer to responsibility and growing up, which I think is the overall theme for this song. 
The first lines refer to the loss of a loved one who had been suffering from mental illness, which would be an introduction to the real world, showing that nothing is perfect. As we all know, none of us should know this, it sucks. He learned way too soon that reality is coming and he needs to gain some responsibility.  
The Second line is his father telling him that as he's getting older, he needs to start a family of his own and assume the role of the Man of the House, making him realize, ""I've been raised only to do this."" 
The Chorus refers to how bad things happen in life, such as tiredness, pain, and even trivial things like your favorite shirt being destroyed . Friends will lead you down a road of s**t that'll eventually drive you insane. 
The rap talks about living the life of a grown adult, and how he sees things and how things see him. He wants it to be over, because he wasn't ready for any of it yet. 
The last verse refers to how he wasn't ready for any of this, and he feels alone because he was thrown into something that he wasn't prepared for. He fears that he'll never live up to what everyone makes him believe he has to, and it's those fears that keep him going day to day. 

This is just my interpretation of the song. Don't take it to heart that it's the solid truth, because I know just about as much as anyone else on the matter.

i think tyler's grandfather died when he was young because the adults are telling him that he lost his mind but in reality, the grandfather had mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, etc.) so he killed himself.

@thisistooshort 















I think this song is about him being in a long line destined to go crazy. I googled 'Pantaloon' and as far as i understand it means a crazy old man. His grandfather was a pantaloon, so came his dad, and this song is telling him that he soon will be the pantaloon. He sits in a chair surrounded by all the people as their lives move on, while he is alone and grows old and crazy. He walks the graves of his dead friends at old age, alone without a family, he soon becomes the pantaloon.

@GregYan 















The word pantaloon can also be used to describe pants. Pants are sometimes referred to as jeans. Biologically speaking, it could be a metaphor for your genes (dna). The song is giving the grandpa the pantaloons at the beginning (genes) and Tyler has learned that he shouldn't trust whatever illness he has. He learns his father also has it, making him just like his grandfather. Tyler goes through life as anyone normally would. He later learns that he too has inherited that illness or disease and is saying he is just like his father and it emotionally and mentally tears him apart like a moth is eating through his clothes. Without his clothes (or his sanity) he feels metaphorically naked. 

I hope this is acceptable for some people and makes sense. This is what I thought because my grandpa literally died when I was nine. My dad is just like my grandpa and I am just like my dad so here ya go.

I think the  song is reffering to the pantaloon as a sort of drug/poison.
About how the grandfather died because of it and how the father and the son will follow him. 
Through the song there is an aging process and the  drug is taken to forget it. The young boy didnt trust the pantaloon (drug) because the granfather died from it.

for me this song is about keeping faith, that you are on the right track and one day youll reach to the point of parabol/parabola. its about a special moment when u r as down as ever, but you have felt like this a million times before, and u are tired of still giving blood, givng your everything and getting nothing in return. and u remind yourself that u may allways walk away wich means killing yourself. you'll allways have that option and its the one thing you have, the only thing. and cuz the rewards are so tempting (parabol/parabola) then u remind yourself that you have got to be patient, you have to wait it out.

She left and I wanted to fix the bad blood but the only thing, only option is to move on and no contact. I've been on good terms with most people in my life and so it certainly killed a piece of myself to let it lye the way it did, but there were no other option than to let it go and move on. Just have to wait it out and be patient. The heartbreak will cease and the job will start to make more money soon, which is why I moved here in the first place. It certainly was a test and I just gotta do what I hate because I've gotten too good at it, being patient.

At the Sydney show in july this year, before they played this, Maynard said something like this song is about the vampires that you come across in your life, who try to get you down. Hence the use of ""giving blood"" in the lyrics. It could be to do with the record companies and the industry.

@schism86 















ok, this may be a bit long but here goes what i think of this song. some of my interpretations may seem a bit random, cos when i read the lyrics of this song it totally worked on what i've been thinking about for ages now, so some of it is related to what i personally believe, but if you can bear with me, i'll try make you all see what my view is. 

the vampire is society : in our world it is based on money, with too little thought to what is important to people...""drain vitality"" -we are beaten down by the trials we have to go through everyday to get by in our cut-throat world. i think maynard is saying all the way through that he holds out hope that things will change(he's still giving blood, he has a desire to heal the damaged and broken-he's trying to help the world through his music) and that if he didnt have that hope, that belief that people appreciate what he's doing, and that it is doing some good (rewards reaped...) then he would have ""walked away""...quit the music industry, given up on life...see that to mean what you want. so basically, he's saying he has to have patience and keep hope that things will change, that people will change...but that he still might give up if he doesn't see any difference occuring...

the ""tedious path"" that he has chosen is one of trying to help the world...he's still ""giving blood, keeping faith"" but it is tedious because there is so much opposition to it by society and people who do not want to change things for the better of mankind. 

basically its a fight against the drain of society, a fight against the cruelty in this world : he's fighting it, but he needs us to fight it too so that he can see there are other people who want the change, and so a change can be made. he has to be patient and keep going or else there isnt any hope left for us. sorry if this is all a bit off track, i cant exlain it as well as i see it!

I kind of think this track is about the artistic process, especially in terms of creating for a wider audience. Maynard has said he wants the music to help people heal, or introspect or soul-search. The process of creating music and sharing it is draining, but it's because of his ""desire to heal the damaged and broken met along"" that he continues to do it in this manner.

I'm suggesting that he is a human being, just like you or I, who is very in touch with the seen and unseen reality of life.  Either that or he's just wasted on drugs all the time, but I think that the music is to sophisticated for that possibility.

@Beowulf_Xtreme 















the most EXCELLENT thing about all tool and APC songs (pointed out by headon earlier) Is that they're so heavily layered in metaphors that they can apply to anyone - and any situation.

Almost every song I listen to by them really sums up my ""love life"" at the moment.

I'm desperately in love with the most fantastic girl, and i've had a fair few chances with her in the past - and I have made progress with her.

In The Patient, Maynard sings about devoting himself, keeping faith.

In my situation, I think of how I keep putting time and effort into making this relationship with this girl, thinking someday it'll all fall into place for me.

And the loving embrace to see me through - I usually think of my very close friends who have always comforted me in the situation etc ;)

..... But ...... I'm gonna wait it out ;)

He's calling out all the hypocrites that criticize stoners, but are just as lazy and worthless.  Druggies might be liars, but so are lawyers, there isn't much difference.

People get up on a soapbox and preach about what everyone is doing wrong, but they are standing in a flimsy house of cards.  And people that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, because eventually they get back what they've dished out.

That's a clear reference when he talks about pissing on the black kettle.  Ever hear the phrase, 'calling the kettle black'?  You see everyone else's faults but not your own.

@TeriEsoc12 People who drugs, such as the admission that @pmahones said, are often associated with that stereotype. ""All druggies are liars and can't be trusted"" is thrown around all too much, yet we have lawyers that are paid to lie and protect people that are accused of a crime and still we consider them trustworthy just because they supposedly ""uphold"" the law. The point of the song, which @rock_hawk stated, is just that. They are hypocrites. It is known that druggies will lie to get drugs, which is a stereotype, meaning it's not the same in every case. Your ignorance to believe that stereotype without actually knowing or being apart of a community of drug users is really prominent in the comment you posted.

			*use drugs			

@rock_hawk.  Right.  Also note that it's ""The Pot"" that calls the kettle black.			

This song is about the kangaroo court which was a bullshit court and it’s about the judge who is the one calling the kettle black 'cause he's sending pot smokers (meaning small time offenders) to years in prison while he himself is a heroin user.

""Eye hole deep in muddy waters"" describes a junkie holding up the spoon he just cocked his heroin on to see if it’s right and ready to shot up. 

its about corruption and injustice and how those in a position of power get away with crimes while a small time/first time offender is made an example off and is sent to prison for years.

I really don't think Keenan intended for this to be about any one, specific issue. I see this as a general middle finger to hypocritical demagogues, who do wrong to others for their own gain by hiding behind their perceived authority. That's self-evident to anyone who's heard the saying ""that's the pot calling the kettle black,"" if you add that with a few other references in the song.

Specifically, Keenan did mention marijuana prohibition as inspiring the lyrics, but he did say it's about hypocrisy in general but could apply to many things. In any interview I've heard with him, he seems to play his cards pretty close in revealing meanings of his songs. He's not the type to get on his ""soap box"" to ram something down people's throats, and wants people to think for themselves instead.

Keenan has reportedly spoken publicly that he thinks the U.S. government was involved in 9/11. At a concert, which had been scheduled the day of 9/11 and rescheduled a few days after, the crowd was chanting ""USA, USA!"" when he said a few words about the victims. When they chanted, he reportedly said something like ""You all are going to really be bummed out when you find out we did this to ourselves.""

If you apply the lyrics to that situation, they fit as well as marijuana prohibition. ""Who are you to point your finger"" (Patriot Act, Real ID, TSA screenings, domestic spying, police state), as an example. ""Kangaroo done hung the jury"" (like a rigged ""kangaroo court,"" the Patriot Act didn't examine all evidence purposely and many feel it let the guilty go. ""He's as guilty as the government"" (many people realize bin Laden was formerly funded by the CIA, and see more evidence of complicity in 9/11 when they look at the government than they do bin Laden) The examples can go on.

			I'm not sure I'd go so far as saying he thought the US government was directly involved in 9/11 from that quote. It's more that the people created the conditions that allowed it to happen. Or, if you want to get really deep then it's a reference to the belief that we are all one and therefore did it to ourselves. I wouldn't go that way though.

THIS SONG IS ABOUT:

how the Information age (internet, new media, etc.) is all about doing the most outrageous, absurd drivel just to get ATTENTION...

hence, the song begins: ""May I have your ATTENTION please?
May I have your ATTENTION please?""

then it talks about attention-getting stunts, like Tom Green humping a dead moose, Aguilera/Spears/Durst/Daly sexcapades to get headlines...as well as Pam Anderson & Tommy

so Em playfully joins in the game, & says outrageous things -- like that he killed Dre...& talking about Viagra, etc.

he mocks how people are drawn in & attracked to the outrageous -- as w/ his parody of feminists saying that he grabs his you-know what, etc...

the point is that in this day in age, the attention goes to the vapid outrageous, so you play along -- by creating a persona (the Real Slim Shady)

amazingly, and ironically, this song comes right before Whatever You Say I Am on the CD... that song deals with an opposite reaction to the media/papparrazzi era that we live in... in that song he reacts violently against it -- but in this song (The REal Slim Shady) he has fun with it...

Eminem is easily the deepest rapper there is.  He raps to be funny, deep, make money, to send messages, etc.  He has songs for just about every mood anyone can be in.  I'm pretty sure eminem has at least 1 song that ANYONE can relate to.  He has so many different songs about so many different topics.  This song, for example, is his skill of not caring and being funny(he succeeded).  Eminem is very talented and very deep.  Maybe the best ever ???

Grow some fucking balls and stop whining
If you really hate Eminem, why the fuck are you looking at his lyrics?
Learn to type. Just because you're on the internet doesn't give you the excuse to talk like a retard.
Get a decent argument. ""Eminem iz shit"" really doesn't cut it you bunch of under sexed morons.

I actually dont like rap at all 5o cent, j-z all that shit is just that, shit!!! but there is something about eminem that i really like, not cause he is hot or what ever, i just love his lyrics. Some of his songs are really meaningful, like mocking bird and others are just plain hillarious. Good pick me up songs. He has major balls: he says stuff other people dont dare to and thats y i love him. Y'all wont believe that my favorite type of music is Metal, well it is, and i like it cause (like eminem) they say what they wanan say and they are sellouts!!! ROCK ON EMINEM...

It was funny to read the first page of the comments. rainbow8711 said ""..it doesn't really matter because no-one even likes eminem anymore, it's totally uncool to like him (finally) and whats more, he has totally dissolved into the depths of music world along with spice girls, take that and westlife. whats that you say, westlife are still around. oh shit well we can but hope...""

I laughed and asked myself ""WTF?"" until I saw the year on that post: 2002. Forward to 2010, his most recent album is one of the best-selling of the year, and most people I know like his stuff, even if they're not fans of rap. Just earlier today, I put on this song for classmates and everyone was singing along! Eminem is far too iconic for rap to be forgotten, and we're certainly not going to be forgetting him anytime soon. 

Anyway, this song is pretty good. Much of his stuff is good; there is some that I don't like, but the stuff that I do like outweighs what I don't. Keep it up, Em! And give us more fun pokes at society and the media.

I wrote the song because Anita and i would argue at a constant pace and I would always tell her to unleash the dogs and burn the bridges as a way of saying you can say what you feel but forget the past and let's move forward. in an argument one always has to stand down until the other quits. this cleans off the slate. the first verse contemplates arguing all night long until one gives in and they embrace each other and start over. this was not one of my ""dark"" songs. I write what I feel and I was not feeling ""dark"". if you want ""dark"" then immerse yourself into murder ballads. thank you

I think that is a fair interpretation, however, I think it could also be about forbidden love, an affair, not just old lovers.  It's clear that they are old lovers with a history.  Burning bridges, makes me guess that she is married.  Finding myself in a similare situation in my life, I find the line ""We make a little history, baby/Every time you come around"" especially beautiful.  Inside of a relationship that can have no future, I found myself telling my lover that I will remember him when I am an old woman.  Sometimes life is complicated, like a good song.

I agree with Lady Evelnhair, this is a beautiful song.  I love it.  I have only heard the version with Concrete Blonde and it is so good.  
 My favorite lines are:

Your face has fallen sad now 
For you know the time is nigh 
When I must remove your wings 
And you, you must try to fly 

It is about letting someone you love go.  It may be sad, but it is the right thing to do.  Although, I have always wondered why the songs speaks of ""removing wings""  when it is hard to fly without them?  Perhaps that is the irony in it?

@Vertigo22 Not really? It opens with the chorus, which uses medieval / early modern l war imagery (sail your ships, burn bridges, loose your dogs). So this more explicitly describing an argument that yields to lovemaking pulls it all together. It's great. And it fits Cave's own description of the song beautifully. ""The first verse contemplates arguing all night long until one gives in and they embrace each other and start over.""

i think this song is about inspiration. the process of creation. 
it's always a struggle. taking from some unknown source. working as a tool for something you may not fully understand. 

you can define a moral ground, think of it as a craft, put it in a 'frame'. but when it comes to 'painting' - rules are no longer valid. they're useful as a rational background. hints for the person who encounters it, leading to the certain emotional path. but the process of creation remains a mystery. 

come sail your ships around me
and burn your bridges down
- an invitation for a brand new journey

come loose your dogs upon me
and let your hair hang down (image of tranquility)
- haunt me with ideas and watch the clash

your face has fallen sad now
for you know the time is nigh
when i must remove your wings
and you, you must try to fly

let's say that inspiration is personified as an angelic vision of a woman. with wings being a symbol of freedom but also of a womb. her face is sad, she feels the end is near. the work is done. another gulf has its bridge. 
i think that's the most difficult/important part in the process of creation - knowing where the thread changes its structure. the moment when you say 'cut'. you see the birth of something that has its own life. 
'remove your wings' - remove protection. you must try to fly - find your way to people. inspire. 'grow your own wings'. 

this song is more than a song. it's a description of a particular frame of mind. that's the way i see it. 
but the most important beauty of any song, poem, painting, (...), is the fact that anyone can understand it in his/her own way. if it strikes a chord, develops something new in you every time it comes around - the work is done. the circle is closed.

I think this song is about two ex-lovers that continually go back to each other.  

The two lovers have a history of each time they meet they make love.  But this time when they meet again, they don’t want to let this happen because they are both very guarded and hurt during their on and off again relationship.  When they talk about their moral ground, I feel that it is they are agreeing to not make love.  However, when they are in each other embrace “everything comes tumbling down” and they can no long resist the urge to make love.

Someone's probably mentioned this before, but I'll add it anyway since it's pure awesomeness:

""When Brian May presented the final demo to Mercury, he had doubts that Mercury would be physically capable of singing the song's highly demanding vocal line, due to the extent of his illness at the time. To May's surprise, when the time came to record the vocals, Mercury consumed a measure of vodka and said ""I'll fucking do it, darling!"" then proceeded to nail the vocal line in one take without problems.""

Freddie was seriously amazing. He managed to live more in 45 years than a lot of people do in twice that. I love this song: it just captures how he lived perfectly.

Also, I think ""I'll fucking do it, darling!"" is going to be my catchphrase from now on.

Its about life. Replace the word 'show' with 'life'. Its saying that there are hard times in life but we should carry on and still aim high. Freddie Mercury was very optimistic, even when he found out he had aids, this was his outlook on life and if we all think about it it should be true. Its telling us that life goes on regardless fo what happens. Very meaningful.

I like to think that this song was about Freddie's attitude in the face of his final stages of AIDS.  He knew he was dying, but he fought up to the very end.  I think he felt that he couldn't give up.  Life is a battle, but despite whatver comes our way, the show must go on.  Also, I think that it was a way for Freddie to tell the world that despite his illness, he continued to make music up until the very end.  He loved his fans, and I think he wanted to please them as long as it was humanly possible for him to do so.

The song meaning is obvious, but this is just on of those songs that transcends the meaning of the words.  Listening to to Freddie Mercury sing this one is beyond any other Queen song; he lifts it up from sappy to spiritual.  

It carries the weight of Mozart's Requiem.  Many writers sing about dying, but very few (Roy Orbison comes to mind) have a chance to write about it when they know it's coming.  Mercury conquers death with this song (""Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die/I can fly my friend"" ""I'll face it with a grin/I'm never giving in"").  The song was beautiful when I first heard it as a child; when I found out the circumstances it was truly haunting.

I was six when Freddie died, & ironically had never even heard of Queen, when it was announced he had died of his illness.

I watched every tv program dedicated in Freddies' honour & as i grew older gradually bought the albums & then I heard this song, & I cried. It overpowered me, the beauty of the lyrics spoke to me & told me what Freddie had been going through & I couldn't believe how much this song called out to me. It made me understand how he felt inside & for this made me feel as though I knew this man, although at one point I never knew who he was.

Now I'm young and had only really known the queen songs that were obvious through the media, but after a ew years started getting into it more and more.

After hearing I started looking for dates to see if it was at all related to Freddy's aids.  I found that Brian May wrote it, and that he did it before he really knew anything about the aids (they're pretty sure anyway). So I dunno.  Still a great song though. I'm gonna keep resaerching (cuz that's what I do) and I'll write what I find later.

Lovecraft used the term “Great Old Ones” in only two stories: in “The Call of Cthulhu” it referred to Cthulhu’s spawn, and in “At the Mountains of Madness” it was the title of the starfish-like beings who lived in Antarctica and warred with the Cthulhu-spawn!

Cthulhu is a “Great Old One” and he is of a race called the “Spawn of Cthulhu”.

Cthulhu lies ""dead but dreaming"" in the city of R'lyeh, a place of non-Euclidean madness presently sunken below the depths of the Pacific Ocean. 
 timeless sleep
 has been upset
 He awakens

 It is said that the ""Great Old Ones"" will return, causing worldwide insanity and mindless violence before finally displacing humanity forever.

			thats awesome..i never looked at the solo that way. kudos			

This song might as well be the theme song to H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.  Every line of this song is related.

""Messenger of Fear in sight""
A reference to Nyarlathotep, the messenger of the Old Ones.

""Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free""

""Hybrids"" are a reference to the offspring of Deep One / Human interbreeding.  The Deep Ones are servitors of Cthulhu and Dagon, either of whom could be the ""father"" mentioned in the song.

""Crawling Chaos, underground
cult has summoned, twisted sound""

Another reference to Nyarlathotep, who is also known as ""The Crawling Chaos"" or ""The King in Yellow"".

""Not dead which eternal lie
stranger eons Death may die""

This is a version of the couplet made famous in ""The Call of Cthulhu"".  The original version is ""That is not dead which can eternal lie, for with strange aeons, even death may die"".  

""drain you of your sanity
face The Thing That Should Not Be""

This is a refernce to what happens when humans are exposed to the old ones in Lovecraft's stories.  His thesis really is that humans are insignificant in the cosmos, and that the universe does not really make sense.  For example, in Lovecraft's universe, the Source of All Things is the blind idiot god, Azathoth.  Humans who come too close to understanding these truths risk going insane, in that the human mind is no more caplable of withstanding these truths than our bodies are meant to withstand high speed impacts.  

In many of Lovecraft's stories, insanity is the ultimate fate of his protagonists.

The inspiration:
The song is based upon the short story ""Shadow Over Innsmouth"" by H.P. Lovecraft which has been written in 1936. ""Shadow Over Innsmouth"" was Lovecraft's sole story which has been released as a book when he was alive. His further short stories only appeared in his lifetime in a magazine called ""Weird Tales"". 
encycmet.com/songs/…

This is a really good, underated song imo.

The Thing That Should Not Be 

It is about the story ""Shadow Over Innsmouth"" 


""Messenger of fear in sight"" 
""Dark deception kills the light"" 
The shadow over Innsmouth 

""Hybrid children watch the sea"" 
The former leader of the citizen of Innsmouth captain Obed had an agreement with the underwater creatures. The citizens will get gold and fish from them in return that they mate with these creatures. With time every new born citizen became a hybrid between the creatures and humans 
""Pray for father, roaming free"" 
The hybrids (Innsmouth citizens) were waiting for the one day when they will go underwater to live there 

""Fearless wretch"" 
""Insanity""

It's been said a million times already (Nodens pretty much hit the nail on the head), but this song is HEAVILY influenced by H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.

I just finished reading his short story, ""The Crawling Chaos"".

It's not terrifying as much as it is amazing how they could incorporate H.P. Lovecraft's tales into a song. 

I mean, it blends in almost every story I've read so far. 

If any of you haven't read Lovecraft's work, get to it.

 I think he left the girl he (found out later) he loved alot, and regrets it. Or maybe he left out of anger or because he didnt feel he was good enough or along those lines. Either way, he still loves her, and hes asking her not to tell anyone the real reason why he left, and to continue to make up excuses for his absence. 

 Or it could be that he left a girl, or she left him, but he still loves her, but he think its better if he stays away.

I am this person. I could be either one. Running away or crying to stay. But damn, this is real life. When ya don't hear from someone for awhile, and all the time you have held on, kept your head up high....just like wading through a deep creek. Should you go under or should you wander on.......or take a chance of never looking back. But if I don't take the chance of looking back, would it bring me anything, or even Give me anything? This particular person has had a tippy-tight hold on my heart from the very first night. And that turned into 1o years.....with both of us runing from each other's friends,and that was A Lot OF the Trouble's  and well, you should be able to read between some lines. That is what I need, someone elses' thougts. He maybe made himself crazy, but in the long run, he tore my world apart., but the feelings never changed. Each meeting, pass-by. damn. What the hell can anyone make right anymore. Cause he makes me crazy too. and that  has been advoding one another very hard for a very long time now. Ya'll lovers and cheaters, lovers and haters; give me some kind of , hell there ain'nt so sign. I just want your thoughts, your viewes. Should I leave or go, Love him and stay. Take him with, and just runaway. I waNT  'THE Truth FROM EVERY INCINDENCE OR HAPPENING.........OR AN IDEA THAT I CAN PUT MY FEET BACK ON THE GROUND.
HE JUST SENT IT TO ME........OUT OF THE BLUE.....EVEN THOUGH OF LOW CONNECTIONS........IS IT TIME TO MAKE THE ONE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID & IT FINALLY TIME TO NOT BE AFRAID OF THE TRUTH.

I think this is about a guy whose girlfriend ended their relationship, and how he denies missing her to everyone around him, including her and wants her to tell her friends he's over it: ""Tell em *all*...that I'm probably doing fine"" and ""the truth is, i'm asking you to lie"". So he's pretending to move on, but inside he really does miss her and he's stuck on her. In the song I he's talking directly to his ex, cause he says at the end ""tell em' anything you want to, just don't tell em' all the truth, i still need you, that's the truth..."" and so on

My interpretation probably doesn't matter at this point because so many others have posted already, but I'll give it a go anyway. I feel the lyrics describe an introverted guy who finally finds a girl that understands what it means to be lonely. The ""door"" spoken of in the song is the guy's soul, and the girl is the only person who has ever been able to make it ""crack open."" She dies (""The door is closed, so are your eyes""), and he goes on waiting for death, alone again, because she was the only one with the ""key"" to his soul. I can almost relate to this song...I've yet to meet that girl.

@TheF16Falcon I agree, except I don't think she actually dies. I think it's a metaphor that their inability to forgive each other and their pasts and move on has killed her inside. So he finally finds a way to see the sun and a way out of it and he plants the key (or the seed) inside of her too, because he sees that she is also unforgiven and all they both want is to forgive themselves, and each other, and move forward into happier times. I think he's finally figured out his way out and is trying to lead her there too without forcing her.

I think he's finally figured out his way out and is trying to lead her there too without forcing her.			

""Lay beside me, tell me what they've done""
He's find another person, who has gone through the same ordeal he has, society rejects them both, and tries to get her to confide and console in him her experiences and demons of her past.

""Speak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true""
He wants her to say things that will help ease the darkness he in consumed in.
The door symbolising his secrets, the demons, the darkness, pain, suffering, and memories of his past which he will expose and confide to her if her actions are genuine and are really out of love & compassion.
The door also symbolises the passage to freedom and the gateway to redemption.
He wants her to help him find solace and bury the burdens of his past. 

""If you can understand the me, than I can understand the you""
If she can understand what he's gone through and has been in similar circumstances than surely he can understand what she's gone through as well. 

""Lay beside me, under wicked sky
The black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyse""
He is asking her to join him in the ""darkness"" with the demons that haunt them. Every passing second they are consumed in this pain and suffering they both feel for their own as well as each other’s ordeals, ""paralysing"" them in the process.

""The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black hearts scarring darkness still, but there's no sun shining through""
They both seek solace and comfort in each other hoping for redemption. The ""Sun shining"" through the door symbolises the redemption, the forgiveness they both desperately seek to overcome their demons behind the door to their past.

""Black hearts"" symbolising their own two hearts, still in the ""Darkness"" with their demons. (When I say demons I don't mean literally, I mean it figuratively as in ""demons"" symbolising their woes, negative experiences, haunting memories of their past etc)


""What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you""
He reflecting what he was taught and programmed to believe whilst growing up by the world, society 's norms, the system, His parents, other people and God.
He wondering if he should help her seek redemption by opening the door for her, after all she's trying to help him (refer to what i said before about what I think the door symbolises)

""Yeah
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?""
He's faced his battles and the demons of his past alone and wonders if she can be with him as he ""turns the pages"" of his past like a storybook and reads it out a loud to her and help him see through it not alone but together, relieve him of his pain and memories by sharing them with her. 

If you notice, when you tend to share your problems with some one else it feels as though they share half the weight of your burden, yeah well that’s what I'm trying to say here.
He contemplates if she's like him too . . Unforgiven that is.

""Lay beside me, this won't hurt, I swear""
He's trying to convince her to help him confide his darkness in her and promises it won't affect her in anyway, or hurt her in the process (which is a load of bull, because how can not another person's experience especially that of a person whom you love not kill you, to know that muthafckers out there have broken them)

""She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again""
As he's telling her all his secrets, he's unsure if she stills loves him the same still, or if her love for him changes.

""She lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone
Black hearts scarring darker steel, yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone""
He's saying that he'll be able to be ""forgiven"" because of her but the thing is he'll be forgiven before her and he will no longer have to live in the ""darkness"" with his demons as he has found redemption at last. 
She on the other hand is still unforgiven and thus lies in the darkness with her demons alone.

""What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you""
Like I said before I think the chorus is the ""aftermath"" of him finally seeking redemption and leaving the darkness, since it's in past tense with the ""I've"".
Now that he's free, he wonders if he should ""open the door"", help her find redemption as well.

""Yeah
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone""
Even though he's found redemption and is free of his demons, he's alone and misses her.

""Could you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?""
He's wondering if she could join him and leave the darkness of her demons and find forgiveness too. 
He'll wait for her on the other side of the door, where he's found redemption and accepted his demons.

""Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes""
He's come back and returns to ask her what she thinks of him now, now that she knows everything terrible of his past (The door was open for her to enter and see into his memories of his past but now it's closed meaning she's returned from his past and he's finished confiding his ordeals to her).  
There is an ""insight motif"". Her eyes are closed now symbolising she has finished searching for answers of his past and knows everything now.

""But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes, now I see it""
He finally found redemption through her, because she accepts him for who he is and now he's is FORGIVEN. 

""I take this key
And I bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven too""
Figuratively speaking the ""key"" to the door he's giving her symbolises he's allowing her permanent access to his memories and she can ask him about his problems. Also he's giving her to key to access her own painful memories of the past as well maybe.

I wonder if metallica intended to do a pun considering the title of the song ""The Unforgiven II"" . .The second unforgiven person would be the girl who loves him. and In the chorus as well ""'cause you're unforgiven too (II)"" . . coincidence or what . .creative nonetheless. I love this song.

Well that’s my take on it. Believe it or deny it whatever you want with it. lol.

@shingami 















From my perspective, this song is about forgiveness.  
The lyrics come from a man who has a broken heart.
He has been through a stormy past and he blames himself for
his failed relationships.  He has not forgiven himself for his 
perceived failures and is looking for an escape.  ""Turn the page, turn the 
stone"" refers to keeping an open mind and not completely
shutting out a chance for being in a healthy relationship.  
""If you can understand the me, than I can understand the you"" means this person is looking for someone who can understand him
because he cannot understand himself. This is also reinforced by saying
""Lay beside me, tell me what I've done"" because he doesnt understand
why he keeps failing and is unaware of the consequences of his actions.  By saying ""I take this key
And I bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven too"" means that he is searching
for someone who has shared his painful experience so they can
both heal each other's hearts.  He must feel that he cant trust another person unless they understand what he's been through.   ""Never free
Never me
'cause you're unforgiven too"" means that the man can only see himself through the eyes
of another person and therefore can not find forgiveness through that person.  He cannot see himself for what he really is.  He is never free because he 
solely reliant on other people to find his identity. However, the one he seeks is most likely broken and sees themself through others as well.  In a way, the man and his lover act as reflections of each other.  Because they both look for themselves in the other person who can understand them, they will only see their own tormented self through the other person. This perpetuates the man's long string of unsuccessful relationships. He must learn to forgive himself instead of looking for forgiveness in others, otherwise he will never be completely forgiven.

@dompret 















I agree with the poster who feels it's about an introverted guy who meets a girl, but with a different spin:

It's the character from the first song, who feels like everyone in life has betrayed him (everyone's ""unforgiven""). He starts a relationship with a woman and he wonders if she may finally be different from everyone else he feels has labeled and betrayed him. The song is largely about him contemplating whether to totally open himself up to her (""behind the door should I open it for you?""), or will she just betray him like everyone else (""or are you unforgiven too?"").

In the end, for whatever reason, he decides she's the same as everyone else (""because you're unforgiven too.""). He kills her (""she loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again"") and resumes his life feeling betrayed by everyone.

"
1137,The Unforgiven III.json,"
I believe this song has it very clear in the lyrics... It's like, someone does what he/she likes and goes out to do it as best they can, and in their own way... and then get side-tracked following money (light of golden treasure) and then the frustration of facing his/her own mistakes and not having anyone else to blame but themselves...

The first unforgiven was the one unforgiven by society.
The second unforgiven was the one unforgiven by his/her mate.
This, the ultimate unforgiven, is the self-unforgiven... The one who can't forgive himself for what he's done...

So far Metallica are impressing me with a different sound than they had so far, and i have no oppinion formed. One thing I am tired of hearing is: Better than St Anger. 

St Anger IS, musically, not as good as what metallica had us used to, but it must be heard in context. St. Anger is a public vent of all the poison in Metallica. You just watch the documentary (Some kind of monster) to understand that... The sound comes out crude and raw and unrefined just like a feeling. Just like a spontaneous punch.

At least that's my oppinion. And in that context, the whole album fits like a glove.

Amazing lyrics... you can relate this song to so many things. Starting something, getting lost in the way to finally fall, blaming someone else or many for your mistakes, to latter realise that you haven't found peace within yourself and therefore won't be in peace with the world or with that person until you solve things within you. This time the unforgiven is oneself.

Borrowing from an important post from the ""Unforgiven II"" song meanings:

Unforgiven: A child becomes a lost soul after being beaten down by the conformist society

Unforgiven II: That lost soul is found by another. 

Unforgiven III: That lost soul is accepting responsibility for his/her part in his bitter life:

""How can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive""

I duno if any1 else is noticing this or just me, but the intro of the song with the piano and esp b4 the guitar starts to play sounds exactly like 'ecstasy of gold' the tune that Metallica used to play before kicking off each concert from some western movie i think. Anyway its a great song from an even greater album, i think i would have loved it even more if they named it other than the unforgiven 3, i mean enough dweling on that title, name it forgive me or i duno heh, great song nevertheless.

one4metal i noticed also that the intro is a bit similar to the ecstasy of gold by Ennio Morricone, from the famous movie 'the good the bad & the ugly'.

A child is born.
He is raised and forced to conform through pain.
He vows to himself that he will never lose his will.

As a man he never lives for himself.
Everything pure he's ever felt never shows through his actions.
It's too late to turn back.
He will never forgive himself.

As on old man he prepares for death.
He has nothing but his regret.

He forgives not himself.
He forgives no one else.

To sound like another mindless internet drone myself...I'll start this off with ""I think.""  I think this...well, I""m really sure this song is about society today.  And yes, today is the same (if not worse) than 12 years ago when the album was released.  Anyway, I think this song is about society in the manner that nobody is free to be themselves anymore.  The only time we are truly individuals are when we rebel.  The way the world works, as soon as we are born, we are influenced by those around us to join the conformist, industry-ruled world we live in.  Even though it was a comedy, Number 2 in Austin Powers said it best.  ""There is no world anymore.  It's just corporations.""  And given the lyrics ""What I've felt 
What I've known 
Never shined through in what I've shown 
Never free 
Never me 
So I dub thee unforgiven""  
I just find that these enforce my thoughts.  
""What I've felt""  -- deals with his feelings and emotions
""What I've known""  --  Everything that he (and we) know that we aren't allowed by culture to disperse
""Never shine through in what I""ve shown"" --We are becoming one big lump of crap...a big mass with no individuality.  This means that even though he's a person, it doesn't show, because he's a drone.
""Never free"" --Ruled by everything around him
""Never me"" --It's not acceptable in today's culture to be yourself.  (I say screw this and everyone who enforces it, but that's the way it is)
""So I dub thee unforgiven"" --He feels he's unforgiven because he can't find it in him to stand out so much that you'll recognize him in the basic group of lowlifes.  
Anyway, this is what I think the song means.

@OrgasmThroughFinch you know this song well, and probably have more years on me. If society is worse today for conforming, then it might be you being older and having more responsibility, but it is hard to say. In reality, it is your choice to blend in or stand out based on whatever situation you are in. When it doesn't go your way, you can write a song about it and become famous, but then you have to accept all of the requests that come with it. Metallica seems pretty happy despite the anger in their songs.

@Centurian 















OK I know I'm a bit late, but here's what the song really means to me. 

It is about a guy (him, you, me, anyone) who was never free to be himself. Instead, society forces us to adopt certain behaviours from the moment we were born. They tell us what's right or wrong, what's good or bad, whether legally (laws) or culturally (through the opinion of others). So the guy grows up and feels trapped and he can never escape from this prison. Then he just gives up. He doesn't care anymore and feels he might as well die right away since it's not he (the guy he was or could have been otherwise without all the social pressure he had to conform to) anymore who lives but some zombie who has had to live by society's standards. So in a sense, the unforgiven could refer to society as a whole.

But to me, the unforgiven also has a second meaning : himself. He is the Unforgiven because he can't forgive himself for not breaking free from all this crap and finding enough courage to be himself, to be the boy he could have been had he not surrendered to social pressure. Despite his vow to never surrender (that never from this day his will they'll take away), he failed. Then he gives up the fight, he feels old, and he feels his life is over (I don't think the lyrics litterally mean he grew old. That's just how he feels.) He feels there's nothing more to expect from life. (The old man then prepares to die regretfully) What's the point in living if he could never be himself anyway? For him it's too late. He can't forgive society for forcing its rules upon him, nor can he forgive himself for not having fought harder to break free from this when he was younger.

			Excellent take on it!			

@MasterOfMyOwnLife What about

This song reminds me of the novel ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley.

The young boy learns their rules

Deprived of all his thoughts

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win

These lines from the song strongly remind me of the concept of the book - of living in a world where everyone is foolishly conditioned and ""drugged"" to think that everyone is happy. Their thoughts, ideas and their individuality is taken from them.

A brilliant song...

@Ignorethesmoke 















This song is about a father and his sons relationship. The son hates the old man because the old man has no self respect and so was unable to raise the boy with the perspective of self respect. Due to this, the son has a horrible life and blames his father. The father is proud and wont accept his son outgrowing him, thus the conflict of wills, ultimately leading to the sons self sabotage.

@twilightwrath I would disagree (unless he confirmed it in real life). 
The ""old man"" in the song is himself, not his father (""That old man here is me"") and also he's the boy he is singing about (""What I've felt"" etc).
Maybe he's singing to his father, but I would lean more to the possibility that he is singing to young version of himself and he cannot forgive himself for obedience or he's singing to society for wanting him to be someone he's not inside.

I couldn't conclude who is that he cannot forgive. Who has labeled him? His parents (I would doubt that he's talking about his name...) or society? Maybe someone else?

Why not father:
- didn't mentioned him, 
- parent's have control of their children to certain age, this just doesn't add up with:
""Throughout his life the same
He’s battled constantly
This fight he cannot win"" - that would point more to the society.

If you have any thoughts/conclusions please add them, that's just my opinion.

I am really surprised that you all missed the crucial metaphor in this song.  ""I am whatever you say I am"" is a  clear indication that he is comparing his plight to that of Jesus'.  What he's saying is that he thinks he's going to be crucified for trying to change the world.  The song is a brilliant metaphysical conceit and deserves recognition on that grounds alone.  Finally, it is not fame that Eminem is unhappy with, but really the state of the world.  If anyone tells me to go back to English class, I'll shoot them, because I am an English major.  BTW.  Rainbow, here's the dictionary definition of venting from Webster..  Vent vt. (transative verb)  2 -- To express; let out.  Humans have been able to express things for millenia, so it is certainly a human verb.  Alright, I'm done ranting.  Great song.  For those of you who are dead set against Eminem for being misogynistic, take a closer look at his lyrics.  He is a master of irony.  Irony in the literary sense that is.

@six_strung_out 















I completely agree with thisboy about this song. Eminem is the kind of rapper that can rap about just about anything but his most of his songs have a powerful meaning. My favourite part of this song is:
""When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school 
and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin 
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at 
Middle America, now it's a tragedy 
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty 
havin this happenin (this happenin)..""
This, like all of his other lyrics, is one of those things that everyone knows but doesn't have the balls to sa in public. I have to tip my hat to Eminem for writing such a real and powerful song and having the balls to put it out.

Holy shit most of these comments are rubbish!!!! I agree with evryone who actualy likes this song and likes this guy for what his music is. Ok im only 15 and i dont have to listen 2 any of his songs on the radio or shit to go out and buy this guys records i go out and buy the albums but no when im in the car going home i dont feel like a rebel coz iv just bought a rappers cd i feel good coz this guys an amazing artist.
He doesnt whine on, he's simply saying can u leave me alone when im trying to do everyday stuff I dont want to sign autographs when im tryin to feed my daughter or go to the toilet. he doesnt owe his fans anythng we like him because we do.
As for the person who said his music should be in an adult music store or ""xxx"" what a load of crap!!!! If you want to buy his music u go out and buy it if you dont then you dont. why should his records be seperated from others because some people cant handle a bit of every day bad language. I agree with who ever said you should get out more because you do. You need to live a real life one which involves everyday stuff. Don't live your life thinking everything in the world is all sweet because lets face it it isnt, far from it. There is drugs out there, there is people getting beaten up and killed by others there is all that shit so face it!!!! and stop girning over a few sware words!
this guy is a role model for any white rapper out there so what let him be that he's basicaly saying yes i can be a role model but if you see me in the street doin normal stuff dont anoy me or pester me.
he's voicing the opinions of everyother star out there who are to chicken to say it themselves, no one wants fans crouding round them all the time when they are out having a meal and yet because this man voices this you all seem to think he's whining welll think again!!!

@brooks450 















Ok first off, when you get into the music bis or whatever eventually there's a breaking point because the media is so damn annoying. Like for example, even Guns N Roses compares it to a jungle for their song ""Welcome to the Jungle"" I doubt Eminem was paid to write what he writes. I'm sure the companies think his hits are better when he vents in those ways but that's all him and what he's feeling at that time-which is the reason why he (in my opinion) is the best rapper. Not only do his words and rhthym flow well but the way he pauses and starts again in odd places (but well) is aweseome. He wanted to prove that white boys got swag. He's way past prooving now

I think a lot of people are reading too much into this - organized religion or war or whatever.

I think it's a lot more basic than that, though. If you want to live your life, have relationships, love other people, well it's inevitable that you will just end up weeping for your trouble at some point. 

Everything ends sooner or later - relationships go sour, children grow up, friends lose touch, loved ones die, and then so do you.

""I won't be weeping long""

So I guess it's okay to weep, to mourn, but you have to stop eventually and live your life too, or you'll miss all the good bits in between the sad bits? 

I dunno. I don't think this song is ""depressing"" just a... pleasant melancholy. :)

""What are you weeping for?""

""It's my little son I'm grieving for, Father. he was three years old- three years all but three months. For my little boy, Father, I'm in anguish, for my little boy. He was the last one left. We had four, my Nikita and I, and now we've no children, our dear ones have all gone I buried the first three without grieving overmuch, and now I have buried the last I can't forget him. He seems always standing before me. He never leaves me. He has withered my heart. I look at his little clothes, his little shirt, his little boots, and I wail. I lay out all that is left of him, all his little things. I look at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, 'let me go on a pilgrimage, master.' He is a driver. We're not poor people, Father, not poor; he drives our own horse. It's all our own, the horse and the carriage. And what good is it all to us now? My Nikita has begun drinking while I am away. He's sure to.""

@cmtfanatic31289 















AmyBth2005, I agree with you when you say that this song is amazing, but I don't necessarily agree with you when you say it doesn't turn out that way in the 'real world'. I don't know if you grew up in a small town, but I sure did, so I guess I've seen this basic story played out in real life...I mean sure there are some exceptions, but I'd be willing to say that most young parents who were scared at first, would not have wanted to change a thing when everything was said and done. 
This is one of Kenny's best songs, and what looks to be one of his last true country songs. This song is filled with so much emotion, and touches the true soul of country music. Simple and realistic, yet beautifully poetic. Unfortunately, I don't really know what Kenny sings now...and any of you who think it's country, obviously haven't been country fans for long. But he isn't the only one who is 'selling out'. I hesitate using the word selling out, because he's really just become a different person because of the carribean influence, and this influence has changed his music. Whether or not it is for the better is debateable, but all I know is that it isn't very country anymore. 
An example of a real sellout in country music is Toby Keith. I mean, what the hell is ""Stays in Mexico."" He should be ashamed of himself. And the sad part is, he has more fans than ever with his crap music. He made over 95 million last year. This guy isn't even worthy of being deemed an ""artist.""
Tim McGraw is also starting to sell out. He's more subtle about it than Toby, and definately way more talented. But if you compare his old stuff to his new stuff....it just ain't the same, it ain't as country.

@Fransaskois 















I don't know if I would make the accusations stated in that last post by Fransaskois. Everything evolves, including music and if you want to call the evolution within country music selling out, well be my guest but it probably is not a fair assessment.

As for this song, it's got an excellent message for young people. It starts out with him finding out he will be a father at a young age, and thus, the typical reaction which is the overwhelming realization that his life is over and everything he had looked forward to was ruined. Later, he begins to see that his newfound situation involving his daughter has become his life and the life he thought he had lost was still ahead of him in every way possible. Great song with a great message and more people need to listen to Kenny. The amount of comments on this site for his songs are way too limited.

And back to Fransaskois, it's kind of funny that you talk about the evolution of country music being a sell out in a comment of this song of all songs. This song being all about change and how one deals with it, seeing that adjusting to change may result in a better outcome than first seen. So I guess this song is all about being a sell out, Fransaskois? I guess we're all entitled to our opinions.

@and1sxm 















Great point and1sxm, finally some feedback. I try to make bold enough statements to get some kind of reaction, but you're the first one to actually react. (It helps me evaluate my own opinons.) 
I do agree with you on the fact that music evolves, and that is why I said I hesitated calling Kenny Chesney a sell out. I enjoy his new music and I understand that he isn't the same person he was when he first came into the business. (so sell out was definately too harsh of a word in Kenny's case) But his style isn't very country anymore. So than I have to ask you, and1sxm, is it evolution if a genre loses its identity? Take ""Over and over"" with Tim Mcgraw and Nelly as an example (maybe it's a bad example because Tim didn't put it on his album, so we could say he just took a break from his country career on that one...or maybe a first step towards pop music?)  
So when I used the term ""selling out"" before, I saw a difference between it and ""evolution."" I listen to all types of music, from all different eras, which includes country from the 50s to today. Over the generations country has evolved, and yes some have pushed the limits of ""what is country music"" but it has always stayed just that, country music. In my opinion, a lot of country is beginning to sound like pop...there are a lot of people who take pride in being country, and if you're call yourself country than you shouldn't be singing pop, otherwise, call yourself pop.

I agree that this song is about not losing his muse, but wanting her to come to him - almost praying to ""her"" for inspiration. But I also think that the chorus is about her arriving.  I don't think that ""there she goes"" means departure... I think that he means she is doing it again - helping to see his beautiful world.  He has been visited by the muse before and he would do anything to see her again.  The litany of ailments may be intended to point out that even great artists, writers and philosophers were human and also had to struggle to reach their acheivements.

This has to be one of the most hopeful things that Mr. Cave has put on record:

""So if you got a trumpet, get on your feet,
brother, and blow it
If you've got a field, that don't yield,
well get up [now] and hoe it""

Sounds like a do-it-yourself / punk ethic to me.  In other words, his art may not be perfect (""you weren't much of a muse"") but he never promised that it would be (""I weren't much of a poet""). He tries, he knows that he may fail, but it doesn't matter if the muse will just visit one more time.  Notice the last time around that he says ""here she comes"" before the chorus.

It\'s all about having lost the muse.  His beautiful world (ie., inspiration) has gone.  He\'s lying there with nothing in his ears (ie., no inspiration), asking for that stuff (ie., inspiration) to be sent down to him.  He\'s got writer\'s block, clearly, and is envious of all the brilliant artists who weren\'t blocked.  He\'s so passionately, dying for inspiration to come.  Great song.

@smallwonderrobot 















I don't think it's so much about losing the muse, more to do with wanting someone to be his muse, but she isn't. The lines:

I look at you and you look at me and
deep in our hearts know it
That you weren't much of a muse,
but then I weren't much of a poet

indicate that to me. Also, he is willing to do anything to have that muse, as he says in the verses "" i will lie at your feet"" etc. It's a song about envy of the great artists, and also about desire to be one of those great people, but the realisation that he is not really good enough.

Don't forget the mention of these particular great artists' physical obstacles.  That litany of ailments has to play in there somehow.

I know I have felt un-inspired as an artist before.
I have also scorned myself when I see people with huge obstacles accomplishing more.  Sitting there with opportunities and health, it can make one feel ashamed.

(just the kind of unpleasant realities Cave dwells on that no one likes to talk about)

I think he's speaking to God (I am not religous, but Cave is) and to us.  God is his maker, ""she"" is the world (Mother Nature?)  and his muse.  Listen/read with that thought - I think its pretty close.

@Stevie Star 















This is a love song to the world that created all of the beauty he spoke of.  He also speaks to a woman (separate from the world) whom he loves.  Nonetheless, their love doesn't compare to the wonder of the world in which they live. 

""I look at you and you look at me and
deep in our hearts know it
That you weren't much of a muse,
but then I weren't much of a poet""

There's this hopelessly romantic ideal that he would do anything for a world that could create such amazing beauty, but nothing he can do will ever come close.

1159,Thinking 'Bout You.json,nil
1160,Third Eye.json,"
Hello Everyone,

This song is not about drugs. It is an insult to this great band to imply that MJK is only speaking about drugs, drug use, and drug effects. This song is really about Quantum Physics. At the begining of the song MJK quotes Bill Hicks. He says

""Today a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here's Tom with the weather.""

This one paragraph is what the whole song is about. He is talking about the Big Bang. When all atoms in the universe where ONE atom. Then the big bang happened and created the universe. That is why we are one consciousness, because we are all one (originated from the same thing). By the way the man that realized this theory did not do acid, it was Albert Einstein. (Theory of Relativity)

""Prying open my third eye"" is not a reference to MJK's penis or his Peyote eye. The third eye in Buddhism is your consciousness. Your third eye allows you to see reality as it is, not the reality that we think exist, which is the reality we create in our minds that we see, taste, touch, etc.

We have all heard MJK refer to life as an illusion. Life is what our brain tells us what we are experiencing. When the Big Bang happened it not only created you, me, this planet, our universe, but it created all the parallel universes. Which means that if we are all one because we originated from the BIG Bang. Then that means that we all exist in everywhere, including other dimensions and so on. So, right now at this very moment you exist multiple times throughout space. That is why life is an illusion.

""So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?""

This is also related to Buddhist philosophy. The principle of Reincarnation. He says the statement above several times throughout the song. The first, he is talking about visiting himself as a child. The second is him visiting himself from another life time. According to Buddhist Philosophy, when you die you do not take with you anything but your Karma. This means your physical appearance, your knowledge, your car, all of these thing do not come with you to your next life. That is why MJK says this,""

I stick my hand into his shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel,
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song.""

You can see who you were in past lives, who you will be, and even who others were. If you just open your third eye. 

If you have time go to youtube.com and type in ""what the bleep do we know part 1."" Watch the whole movie. It will thoroughly explain all of these concepts. We all see what we want to see. Just read through the comments, and see how people distorted MJK's lyrics because they wanted MJK to say what they wanted to hear.

If you are an avid TOOL fan, or if you know anything about TOOL. You know that they don't clearly state the point. Not because they are trying to be tricky. They want you to think for yourself. All of our lives we have been fed distorted information. We have been given answers to all our problems with the click of the search button on Google. TOOL doesn't want to give you the answers. They want you to find them on your own. Be pro-active learn the truth because you won't in school. Our governments, our dogmatic religions ( such as christianity, Islam, Jeudaism), and our teachers don't want you to know the truth because you begin to question. When you begin to question you begin to ask. When you ask then you act. This leads to revolution.

I hope this comment helped open your third eye.

""Liberate yourself and you will liberate the world""

			thanks  the interpretation! makes total sense 2 me...

			Great analysis and I agree with you completely except I think the song is also at least related to drugs. I.e., drugs are a tool used to pry open the third eye. This is implicated by the reference to ""desert buttons"". Not to mention the opening line is about what a young man realizes while on acid. It's a funny joke because that's roughly what anyone who takes enough acid will feel like, since the drug temporarily suspends the ego.			







+7








 
			Dude you are preaching some pseudoscience bullshit. If you knew anything about physics or chemistry you'd understand the idea that you can change reality by thought is absurd. That we can't find our ""past selves"". We aren't subatomic particles alone. We can't control energy and matter with our minds. But your RIGHT about Tool not giving the answers. They want you to figure it out for yourself. Believe your own preachings and don't get sucked into documentaries with a lot of falsified information. Third eye is about consciousness and I believe people need to be conscious of the reality of OUR physical world. Who we CAN be or WANT to be. Humanity is morally lost, we can use that consciousness to find ourselves again. Because when we can find apart of ourselves that isn't so tainted by materialism maybe we could help out other human beings who are REAL. Don't think of our world as imaginative one. We are living.

			@rachel202020 Actually people don't have to stop believe something since one says it is not true. I believe that this is an illusion and that the though can change it, just with a simple idea. Isn't that true? A single word can change the entire way of the world and history. There are plenty of examples of that in history. And if you defend that we should think for ourselves how can you not question actualy everything you were taught!? The only reason you think you cannot cross a wall is because at some point in your life you were said: ""You can't cross that"". I mean, if we question everything that was surely certain and start making a new wolrd based on our new beliefs in a long time we could make our sons and grandsons see the sky red or green. 

But, I went away from my primary point. You must not criticise someone's beliefes. You should respect them and only follow your own. There is no need to force other people into what you believe when they see the world differently. 			







+3








 
			Well actually its not related to Buddhism's third eye but Lord Shiva's third eye, a God in Hindu mythology. The lyrics ""It's bright and blue and shimmering."" specifically says blue because Lord Shiva had dark complexion which looked like blue

Also Karma actually originated from Hinduism also referred in Rigveda, in fact the word 'Karma' is originated from Sanskrit language which is the primary liturgical language of Hinduism.
Many of us confuse 'Karma' to other religions but it was originated from hinduism.

@abcurl1988 I agree with you exept on the link you make with science. You say the big bang happened when all atoms were one but it's wrong atoms were never One but they were concentrated in a space that was the size of an atom so you can't link the lyrics of this song  to the big bang...

@abcurl1988 I'm fairly confident that Maynard doesn't subscribe to such metaphysical BS. Great job preaching pseudo science to a community of skeptics. ""... and you thought that I had run away. Chasing the tail of dogma. / Chasing a trail of smoke and reason."" It should be blatantly obvious to you from this quote that he wants nothing to do with un-falsifiable claims like SMOKE AND MIRRORS (replaced with ""reason"" because pseudo science is the next best thing to religion.)

But hey... what ever makes you feel good and not want to hurt other people man. I support harmless idiocy. Just like Maynard supported his mothers wishes as a christian simply because she was a good person. Nothing wrong with that. Just please don't confuse otherwise intelligent people with this nonsense.

@abcurl1988 I tried to read this, but then I reached the third paragraph.

""This one paragraph is what the whole song is about. He is talking about the Big Bang. When all atoms in the universe where ONE atom.""

I saw past some of the other errors, but the word is WERE. I couldn't read anymore after this.			







0








 
@abcurl1988 Almost, but not quite buddy. It does have everything to do with drugs, specifically psychedelics and whatever else he is smoking/eating/rubbing into his belly. Maynard is not the sole writer of these lyrics, and you are giving him way too much credit, as well as God-like status. Neither MJK, Hicks, or yourself are the originators of those concepts. Maybe you should get off your imaginary high horse and study up on Timothy Leary and LSD. ""Think for yourself. Question authority.."" Sure Buddhism does preach ego-loss and mindfulness as paths to enlightenment, but i don't see any reason to believe this lyrical poetry has anything to do with literal ""past lives"" or reincarnation. Get over yourself and lose your bullshit ego. Practice what you preach man. 			







0








 
			Oh, and it has absolutely nothing to do with the Big Bang or your feeble understanding of that, the universe, or reality. Stop pretending you or MJK have all the answers. Sure, each person's ""reality"" is based on their own particular limited perception, but to imagine that it is all an illusion is just ego-stroking BS. You really ought to eat some acid, shrooms, mescaline, or peyote, then reevaluate your ignorance. You idiots who keep liking his bullshit need to read more, and get out and live as well. SMH

@abcurl1988 ""By the way the man that realized this theory did not do acid, it was Albert Einstein. (Theory of Relativity)""

@goosy1281 















well i am convinced that this song is very heplful for a peson who's going throught a bad time , to give you an example in the song she says ' And if you keep falling down don’t you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound' that means you have to struggle to get thrgought the problem , also she says, when you're in a problem and no one gives you support you can stand up on your own .
i think this track is about her breakdown in 2001 with glitter, she means that she can back up on her own and be the same famous singer as she used to be.
besides that , mariah is the best singer of the 90's , nobody sings the way she does and she has sold more than 150 millions records worldwide, in 2005 mariah's album was the best of that year , in other words  MARIAH CAREY  is one of the best singers of the world

He rebels (he fit the mold to be a rockstar/singer) and sings.  He's not a sheep and follower.  He always dreamed he'd become a big star but his classmates didn't believe in him.  But he was more illuminated than he classmates who criticized him ever thought he was and he really did make it as a big star.  

Then he was the one on stage with ""the last laugh"" while they were in the front seat of his concert (instead of him being in the back seat of the class).

P.S. And maybe some Illuminati kisses (the good-intentioned Illuminati, not the fake bad-intentioned one)

Ok, to answer a few of the questions raised...

The list are people he respects in the industry.  People that rap with meaning to what they say and aren't JUST about bling and bitches.  For the most part the people in his list don't make the Crunk type music and rap with feeling.

As for the Jada remark it was a diss to Benzino.  Basically he means that Benzino had to get someone else on his album just to sell records.  No one bought the album because of Benzino but only because of Jada being on it.

To that one person wondering: 'Bobby and Whitney' is referring to Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston.

His list: Reggie(redman), Jay-Z, Tupac, Biggie, Andre, Jadakiss, Kurupt, Nas and Him is just his list of top rappers who are still rapping and are actually solid, at least thats how I see it. Solid as in, not rapping about bullshit and actually RAP ABOUT SHIT other than bling and bitches. 

Just my two cents: if this song came out later, I would think Lupe Fiasco would be on that list :D

@cmdterps44 















First off the obvious, the song is about not giving up regardless of what others may think or say.

Now to the hot topic(for the last 8 years which is crazy) the list of rappers. He says:

""Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in""

He is talking about all of the whack rappers that are famous(foreshadowing for Soulja Boy and Lil Wayne I assume)He then goes on to say 

""I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me""- 

Here he is listing who he admires in the game. He isn't dissing any of these guys or putting them in a ny particular order, just what flows best in the song. The next line goes

""But in this industry I'm the cause of a LOT of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does NOT offend me
That's why you see me walkin around like nothin's botherin' me""

Here he is saying that if a magazine or TV show or whatever has a list of best rappers like he talks about in the previous line but they leave him off then he doesn't care. He is going to continue to do what he does until he dies.

"
1179,Tin Man.json,nil
1180,Tiptoe.json,"
My interpretation of this song seems to revolve around the idea of evolving one's own identity and breaking free from the socially accepted norm. People always get wrapped up in their own worlds and perceptions; sometimes we forget about the other people around us and their personal development. The first verse, ""let my roots take flight, Watch me from above like a vicious dove"" kind of eludes to the idea that someone is starting to make a name for themselves and those higher up on the social scale who can certainly be ""vicious"" sometimes, but seem innocent like ""doves"" are watching this underdog flourish (and anyone who has been to high school, I'm sure can relate). The next couple lines just reiterate this concept. The well endowed, popular, self-involved crowd can often miss out on the spectacular people around them who are beginning to shine. But the person on the rise doesn't care about what others seem to think. They can't ""blame"" the others for not seeing, as they've never tried to look before. The second verse with the lines, ""From your slanted view see the morning dew, Sink into the soil, watch the water boil"", I understand it as a request to open one's eyes in order to see the simpler things in life. Get out of your twisted, ""slanted"" view on the world, and just look at the beauty within the simpler things for once. The rest of the verse relates back to how if someone isn't truly looking around them, they miss out on other people, opportunities, and life in general. ""Nobody else can take [us] higher"" other than ourselves. We, as individuals, have the ability to bring ourselves up to the highest potential. We don't need others' approval to get ahead, to become what we truly are destined to be. We all tiptoe around people, step on eggshells and dim ourselves in order to fit in sometimes. But it's time we step up and take the social pedestals by storm and make our way to the top. One step or tiptoe at  a time. Don't ""fall asleep"" and let others step all over you and your success; instead ""tiptoe higher"" without ""letting 'em know we're coming"". You don't need to get a big, hot, egotistical head to succeed. If you take your time, ""simmer down"" and ""keep your head down low"", you'll surprise everyone around you. (In saying that, I just disagree with the ""keep your head down low"" lyric - I think you should keep your head held high! In this context though, it's referring to the sneaking manner needed for tiptoeing and going unseen). These are all just my own opinions. Would be awesome to get someone else's thoughts on this addictive tune.

			Thanks for your words. It really got me thinking.
Here's another take:
""In the morning light, let my roots take flight"" --more on this later
""watch me from above, like a vicious dove""
First off, it sounds like he is WILLING himself into the sky. I want to RUN based on what MY roots  (what's deeply important to me). There's irony throughout the song in that we don't take doves to be vicious, we don't expect people who keep their heads down low (aren't proud and boisterous) to be tearing it up and successful.

			Thanks for your words. It really got me thinking. Lots of strands of meaning. I'd like to add another take:""In the morning light, let my roots take flight / watch me from above, like a vicious dove.""
First off, it sounds like he is WILLING himself into the sky. I will FLY based on MY roots  (what's deeply important to me). The word ""let"" is key because he is willing himself as opposed to being ""willed"" by others' views or external incentives, fads, popularity, etc.

""Watch me from above"" may mean people will see you and they'll notice something different even contradictory. You are vicious/successful, etc. but you're at peace.

""They don't see me come--who can blame them?"" Those who are extrinsically motivated (from those who believe people are inherently selfish to those who are driven by fads and popularity)  don't think such things are possible so they can't fathom someone acting on my motives achieving peace and tearing it up (being successful) simultaneously.

""They never seem to catch my eye, but I never wondered why""--what such people accomplish never seemed important to me (driven for money, popularity, other incentives) because I'm not extrinsically driven.

""I won't fall asleep"" and ""tiptoe higher"" go hand in hand to me. I'm not going to stop CLIMBING HIGHER based on what's deeply important to me. I'm going to keep at what really means the most to me and I'm going to take care to do it in a way that's not brazen or pretentious: ""Simmer down, keep your head down low."" If we look up and around us (let others catch our eye in a bad sense), we might start having a ""slanted view like they do."" The words ""I won't"" in ""I won't fall asleep"" are also almost like an internal commitment (and importantly part of the chorus). It's like we have to keep reminding ourselves to not get lax and to keep climbing. Keeping your head down low could mean being sneaky, it could also mean being humble, which could would have lot s of appropriate meanings: 1) keeps us from caring about what others are usually extrinsically motivated by, 2) from caring about what others think of us, 3) from getting distracted or 4) being brazen about what we are doing. Bottom line: in the midst of our success, we can't let it get to our heads; rather, we need to keep climbing inconspicuously--keep advancing what's important without caring about getting accolades for it.

""Nobody else can take me higher"": My perception of others' feelings towards me ain't going to lift me up. I've got to look deep inside and humbly, continually be committed to advancing what matters most.

			Amazing interpretation! I think it's really interesting how both the connotations of the title 'Tiptoe' and the melody of that word perfectly fit the optimistic and uplifting mood or feeling created by the choice of instruments, chords and melody, and further underlined by your analysis of the lyrics. I thought of 'to lurk' as a counter-example, having roughly the same meaning, but incredibly differing connotations and, in contrast, a kind of sinister melody. Wouldn't you agree that when saying 'tiptoe' out loud in a normal tone, compared to saying 'lurk' out loud, the latter would not fit this song at all?

@brandonody Exactly my thoughts!!!!			






@brandonody Exactly my thoughts!!!!			

I think that this song has a pretty straight-forward meaning and message. To me, these lyrics represented something or someone coming out of their shell, or standing up to something they fear. 

They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye but I never wondered why

this part of the song shows how the others treat the person. As a piece of trash that doesn't deserve their time. 

Hey yeah, tiptoe higher

This part shows someone who is slowly (tiptoeing) up to the top (as in, standing up for themselves and getting more confidence about themselves)

These are only MY interpretations

@Miimoo 















Okay, so I saw a lot of long-winded and kinda odd explanations and I just wanted to put in my two cents.

So, the first verse:

In the morning light let my roots take flight
Watch me from above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye but I never wondered why

This suggests to me that the narrator is an underdog in this situation. ""They don't see me come, who can blame them?"" is a reference to the fact that no one cares about him and what he has to contribute to the world.

The chorus:

Hey yeah, don’t let 'em know we’re coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher

This sounds like there's now a second underdog in the mix. Whoever the narrator is talking to, they have the same issues as the narrator. And the narrator is telling him, ""Don't let 'em know we're coming,"" as in, We're the underdogs already so why let them know that we're going to come up on them and be greater than them? The line ""Tiptoe higher"" goes back to the line ""Don't let 'em know we're coming"" but it also would mean, Be as good as you want, show off, be better and do well.

Then the next verse:

From your slanted view see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won’t see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly, so I never have to lie

This is going back to the underdog thing. I don't know exactly what the first two lines mean, but the second one is essentially: They don't pay attention and see me getting better, but I never had to tell them about my plans to be better than them one day.

Then the rest of the song either repeats this or goes back to these meaning.

To me, this is about being underestimated.

""Tiptoe higher"", I think, is saying take your steps even lighter, because then they won't hear you coming. It's him saying, fine, underestimate me all you want, because I'll come up from behind and I'll rise to the top.

Pretty inspiring to me. I listen to it to jazz me up before I take a big test.

This song is about things guys should know about women, of course. I like this song because Miranda's telling guys what to expect from women. And, it is so true. But, let's get the lyrics right.
First, these are the Google lyrics we all find. But, when you edit it, this will make more sense. ""You'll be true and you'll be tride"". Shouldn't it be, You'll be true and you'll be tried? Then, ""If you take her, you might hate her, and be left with just a ray"" How about, If you take her, you might hate her, and be left with just a ring.
Listen to the song and tell me this isn't what she means. Knowing women the way I do, this fits. Tride meaning: (obsolete, of a horse) strong and swift.
With a woman, you'll be true, and she'll test you, (you'll be tried), but the tables always turn. Ray? You'll be left with just a ray?

When I heard this song it was as if he had been following me through my life with this one woman who I have been knowing over 15 years.

"
1185,Too Much to Ask.json,"
I think this song is about someone who's recently or not too long ago broken up with their partner. As shown by lyrics in the song such as, ""now I'm waiting on someone,"" and, ""my shadow's dancing, without you for the first time"" the individual singing the song has already started to move on but still shows remorse for things ending, and isn't over their ex, which is shown by Niall singing, ""cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet"". The singer also shows a desire to reconnect with their ex and see them again shown by the part where they say, ""my heart is hoping, you'll walk right in tonight,"" and hopes that they feel the same way.

This song really hits close to home because, I got my ex this CD for Christmas when our relationship hit rock bottom and a few months later we broke up, however I remember her playing it during car rides and this was the one song that stuck with me during the entire holiday season and some of the new year. After breaking up and listening to this song this really feels relatable as I find myself moving and feel regret over how things ended, I'd still like to reconnect and be friends but can't.

To me this song is a prayer. I know it's hard for non-Christians to accept but stay with me here. You might just find a bit of yourself in this. This prayer is from a person who is feeling alone, as most of Tyler's songs are.

As Christians, we are taught that we are supposed to build a relationship with God. We are told that God hears all of our prayers.

However, it's obvious that while he was writing this song, Tyler felt disconnected from God, like God was standing just out of reach, leaving Tyler alone. I myself feel this often. That's why I relate to this song so much.

""Silent, in the trees."" That's how God is described in this song. Tyler's lyrical metaphors are amazing. If you think about someone hiding in the trees, they would easily be able to see you, but would be hidden in shadow, and would be very hard to spot. The person in the trees would probably be purposefully avoiding contact with you. This is how Tyler feels God is toward him, watching, but choosing not to show himself. This is accurate for me personally. Whenever I try to talk to God, I don't get a response, and that's a bit frustrating to me. Prayer is supposed to be a conversation, and it takes two to have a conversation.

As for the part that says:
""And that's where I am, silent, in the trees.""
Tyler is most likely alone at this point. But what really matters is that he is silent. He is alone with himself. Using knowledge from his other songs, especially Car Radio (which is a great song), we can infer what's going on here. In Car Radio, he says two important things that we need to remember for this song. ""I ponder of something terrifying, cause this time there's no sound to hide behind."" and ""Oh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here; Oh my too deep please stop thinking."" These two lyrics mean that when Tyler is in silence, his thoughts turn dark, and he is scared by them. He'll do anything to get rid of them, even stop thinking at all. It is likely that he would pray to God as an outlet for his emotions and a source of comfort. 

He is scared by his thoughts, and his emotions almost overwhelm him; hence ""I can feel my death."" and ""Why won't you speak where I happen to be? Silent, in the trees, standing cowardly."" Tyler is close to the breaking point, alone with his thoughts. He is asking why God won't talk to him, even when he is at his weakest. He might even be fighting suicidal urges at this point.

So really this song is a prayer to God, asking him to just show himself already. Tyler is scared, and he is looking for a source of comfort and relief. He is frustrated by the fact that God won't respond to him, despite his faith. ""I want to know you, I want to see, I want to say hello."" Tyler isn't holding anything back here. He is giving his full being to God. But we don't get a happy ending like we do in Ode to Sleep. The song ends with Tyler calling out to God in his panic. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Tyler doesn't get what he wants. He doesn't get a response. He is still alone at the end of the song.

This song really is lyrical genius. It makes me personally wonder what happened to make him keep his faith in God. I need one of those moments. Major props to Tyler for taking my most difficult thoughts and making it into music. And major props to him for surviving whatever he was going through to make him feel this scared. And to you reader, major props to you for surviving. Whatever your situation, the trees are never as lonely and scary as they seem. Despite my struggles with faith, I believe that God is there for us. And so does Tyler.

@Keeson This is awesome. Helped me a lot. Just wanted to say thanks :)

@Keeson this is a truly amazing interpretation of what you think trees means, and I agree with your theory 			







0








 
@Keeson one more thing that I think is important to note is that it seems like Tyler is not faulting God so much as he is imploring him. He knows where God is but he can't seem to find him. He is asking God to come to him so he can know him better and even just say hello. I feel like Tyler is being very picky with words and leaving the door open to say something like this: God is there and maybe he's trying to help Tyler find a way through the trees, he CAN see him after all. But maybe gods working in a different way than what Tyler is looking for at the moment.			







+1








 
@Keeson once i learned Tyler was raised a Christian, this song became pretty clear. you summed it up well. Prior to that, I thought he was calling the ""person"" in the trees a coward, but it's clear now he's the one standing as a coward. Any believer struggles with doubt. I've been there and prayed and prayed and prayed, hoping, begging to SEE Him, to hear Him. Prayer alone has never sufficed. It isn't until I'm in prayer AND reading the bible, thats where He is. He is the Word. A find my peace there with him.			







+1








 
@Keeson I agree with everything you said, but let me add just one little alternate theory to it. I think maybe he DOES feel God's presence at one point. I think when he says, ""I can feel my death. I can feel your breath,"" he is actually communing with God.

To explain:

1) ""I can feel my death."" 

In Christianity, we are called to ""die"" to ourselves and instead be filled with Christ. Galatians 2:20 describes it this way: ""I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."" Jesus himself said, ""For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake, he is the one who will save it."" Romans 6:8 says, ""Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him."" There are many, many more verses that reference laying aside your old life, and filling yourself instead with God.

I believe that in ""Trees,"" when Tyler is standing there alone in the silence, his arms outstretched, calling out to God, he can feel himself ""dying to himself."" That's why he says, ""I can feel my death.""

2) ""I can feel your breath."" 

God is often referred to in the Bible as ""breath."" Job 33:4 makes it clear: ""The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life."" 

I believe that in ""Trees,"" when Tyler says ""I can feel your breath,"" he is feeling the presence of God.

And if you follow that line of reasoning, the ""Hello""s that follow the death/breath line are just that — a ""HELLO!"" to God. :)  I think it fits, because Tyler doesn't scream them like he's angry or desperate, particularly if you see him perform this in concert — he screams them as a celebration! Hello!

Just an alternate theory on what that part of the song means!









+1








 
@Moonbeam86 wow that really made me think, and that's a really awesome take on the song!! I hadn't thought of it that way before. Thanks for the response :) 

I really like your interpretation of the line, ""I can feel my death"". This is because the next line supports your point. ""I want to know you."" This would be the reason why he's dying to his own life. To be closer to God. I wouldn't say that Tyler exactly feels close to God yet. Hence the future tense. Maybe God has impacted his life in someway, driving him to desire an even closer bond.

I say that because of the line you mentioned, ""I can fell your breath."" Maybe what he means by this is that God is working in his life. Breath is invisible right? Maybe Tyler is referring to God working in his life invisibly. Another cool point that I just thought of; our breath is visible in cold weather, and a lot of people come closer to God and notice his work in their lives during the hard times. The ""cold"" times. Just thought that was interesting. Maybe that's why he can feel God's breath at this moment in the song. 

Having taken those two points into consideration: what I take away from this is that Tyler has been going through very difficult times in his life. During these times however, he notices the impact of God on his life, and desires a closer relationship with Him. He starts to turn over a new leaf, putting more value in his faith. Maybe this IS his conversion story, his return to faith. Thought I would add on to your statement. Thanks again for your added opinion :)

@Keeson @Keeson Hey - I thought of another theory related to the symbolic meaning of “trees.” I came upon the idea when I was listening to “Forest.” 

Ok so the lyrics in “Forest” say:

“Down in the Forest we’ll sing a chorus, one that everybody knows
Hands held higher, we’ll be on fire, singing songs that nobody wrote.”

Here’s my thinking:

1) Chorus is another term for worship song.
2) Tyler spent many years as a worship leader for his church (New Albany Church/Five 14).
3) The “hands held higher, we’ll be on fire” seems like it refers to people reaching up as they sing a worship song (a chorus).
4) Following this line of thinking, all the arms raised up during worship would look like a forest.
5) So the “forest” in the song probably symbolizes a big group of people raising their arms in worship.

Ok, so if Tyler’s “forest” is a group of people worshipping, I realized maybe “Trees” is referring to the same thing?

As we said before, this song is a prayer someone is saying as they stand silently. However, I think the “trees” means the person is standing silently within a group of people in the midst of worship. The person is surrounded by “trees,” but he is not singing. He’s standing silently, cowardly not singing, but he wants to hear from God. His mind and soul are reaching out for God. And he feels God’s breath, and he feels his own death as God fills him — all in the midst of worship.

It makes sense because why would standing silently in ACTUAL trees be cowardly? It wouldn’t. However, standing in the midst of people worshipping but being too shy to sing (or maybe even too shy to raise your hands) would be kind of cowardly.

And this song was written during Tyler’s time as a worship leader.

So yeah...this might be another symbolic meaning of “Trees.”

@Keeson Hate to come back and reply yet again, but there was a song released recently on Youtube that Tyler wrote for ""No Phun Intended."" There's a line where the lyrics say:

""Have you ever heard the trees singing their song?""

This, combined with ""Forest"" and the trees mentioned in ""Ode to Sleep"" (and the ""trees wave their arms"") makes me really think that what I said above is true ^ that ""Trees"" is from the point of view of someone in the midst of people singing and raising their hands in worship.

I know this is way off but I like to interpret this for social anxiety, which I have. Saying I can feel you is kinda like thinking in your own mind that they're hovering over you making myself nervous.

The wanting to know you and saying hello is perfect for me.

Feeling like your always being watched and judged whenever you go, never knowing what to say when anyone talks to me, often causing me to either say nothing at all or saying very little and just feeling so under pressure and people never noticing me in class because I never say a word, to be honest I'm just afraid of what people will think of me.

The religion thing throws a lot of people off, but I felt it was easy to relate the song to the story of Zacchaeus in the bible. The song to me signifies a dialogue between Jesus and Zacchaeus where Jesus notices him in the tree standing cowardly. Zacchaeus knows that Jesus see's him and says how he feels his breath and death. 

Zacchaeus was a tax collector who wanted to see Jesus. But he was a very short man. Maybe the point that he is a tax collector in that time and age meant that he wanted to stay in the tree cowardly. Yet, he still wanted to see Jesus the great Nazarene! Ultimately, the song ends off by him giving this utterance of how he wants to say ""know"", ""see"" and ""say hello"" to Jesus.

@davidbamford props for referencing Zacchaeus, but for this song I'm not seeing it. Especially since he starts off saying he knows that he is standing in the trees silently. With Zacchaeus, Jesus was never in the tree and Jesus spoke to him and called him down. This song seems more like a struggle with faith and in your darkest hours, when you're sick of falling into the same sinful patterns, all you want is to hear and know God and find peace, but you're struggle to find it.

Until God comes to them . Which I think in the song is represented by the last Long HELLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOO . total zaccheaus reference

In the first 5 lines she’s questioning how loyal he really is. She’s asking if he would get hurt for her, show affection, and do whatever she wants.

In the next 4 lines she's talking about this person taking pleasure out of her pain. And, I think, is sadistic in the way that he mistakes this brutality as love; “I bet you kiss your knuckles/right before they touch my cheek”

And for the chorus she is singing about finally taking control of this sadistic/abusive relationship and deciding to leave finally; ""but I've got my mind made up this time""

definitely about an abusive/toxic relationship. 

there's a lot of questioning going on, as that's what happens in these type of relationships....you start to wonder whether or not this person is worth all your time, love & energy. it's rough.

part of her still loves him ; ""set a fire in my head tonight"" and ""i wouldn't leave you if you let me"" that's where the abuse part comes in. 

at the same time though, she knows it's toxic and unhealthy. ""i've got my mind made up this time"" and ""i bet you kiss your knuckles right before they touch my cheek""

she also questions whether or not this person loves her as well. ""would you bleed for me"" & ""would you beg or would you crawl, stick a needle in your hungry eyes for me""

such lines make you think that this person is only there for a sexual/sadistic reason...they aren't looking for love at all.

i adore this song, it's very sad and beautiful. ash almost sounds like she's gonna cry while singing it. raw emotions at their best.

Similar to what people are saying but here it is...

""Now the night is coming to an end

In ""Holding on to you"" they say how usually your darkest thoughts come at night, so this person is feeling those negetive thoughts, but you must think positively--that you'll go to sleep and tomorrow will be a new day for you to try to be your best and to try to be happy.   

""Stay alive, stay alive for me"" Saying it to someone who feels like they want to end their life.
""You will die, but now your life is free"" You will die one day because you're mortal, But right now your life is wide open and full of possibilities.
""Take pride in what is sure to die"" Take pride in what you do because one day it will be gone (when you die or when your'e no longer able to do certain things).

""I will fear the night again  He knows that even though he's trying to think positively, there will be more nights he'll feel this hopeless. 
""I hope I'm not my only friend"" Just hoping others will be there for you if you ever need them.

I love how desperately he's trying to keep everyone alive. ""Stay alive for me"" in this and ""friend please don't take your life away from me"" in friend please.

I'd like to think he wrote it to anyone who ever had suicidal thoughts. Not a particular person. Sang it so softly too, I want to cry. 

""sun will rise and we will try again."" what a beautiful thing to say! No matter what happened today, there is always a brighter tomorrow. And WE. OMG. You are not alone. So soothing.

The night is used as a symbol for depression or simply bad thoughts. ""I will fear the night again."" It's not clear whether if he fears because he worries about the depressed people or he is depressed himself too. I think the latter. In friend please he says ""till we both see the light"". There is an understanding, his familiarity with this concept takes the song to another level.

Someone special to them has tried to commit suicide, and they are now recovering

[Stay alive, stay alive for me]
Pleading them not to end their life. 

[You will die, but now your life is free]
We all eventually die, but right now, you're alive. You are free and have your future ahead of you. 

[Take pride in what is sure to die]
Again, we all die. Take pride in who you are, and don't let your life go to waste. 

[I will fear the night again] 
Fearing that they will take make another suicide attempt

[I hope I'm not my only friend]
If they commit suicide, they will be alone without them.

This song is the last song on their album vessel. The whole album seems to be about Tyler's inner darkness and how it consumes him, kind of like blurryface. Being that this song is the final song, I think it's about Tyler's ending of this darkness for a time. His light and dark are making a truce.

@Mandalore OHH ""I will fear the night again"" !!!!			






@Mandalore OHH ""I will fear the night again"" !!!!			

""Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die""

The chorus is basically telling the listener that your life is precious and even though you may be suicidal, there is still so much out there so while you are alive, you should take pride in what you have because one day you wont have it anymore.

as for the first line, ""Now the night is coming to an end,"" I believe just ties into the entire story of the album Vessel. Ode To Sleep, for me, takes place just as Tyler is about to go to bed but he stays up all night because ""the dark's not taking prisoners tonight."" So the entire album to me feels like it takes place all through out the night and Truce is kind of his way of finally giving into his sleep and going to bed but signing off with the very important message of ""stay alive.""

@mrtrashcan367 I agree about the ""now the night is coming to an end"" is about the album!			

He's talking about us. That is a common theme in their songs. He rallies people together, and somehow makes ""We're broken people"" sound less like a sad cry for help, and more like a rallying battle cry to uplift and inspire us. He is well aware that the majority of their fanbase is mentally ill teenagers and young people.

""Now the night is coming to an end"" a lot of suicides take place at night. It is when people are alone with their dark thoughts in dark places. But you made it through another night. 
""The sun will rise and we will try again"" 'we' is everyone. All the people in the world, all those that barely made it to morning, will do their best to make it through another day.

""Stay alive, stay alive, for me."" This is Tyler pleading to us to stay alive, for him. In Guns For Hands, when he says ""I'm trying to sleep but I can't when you all have guns for hands"" is him worrying about us. Afraid for us. He cares about us. He stays up late worried about it. When he says this lyric, especially the second time, he sounds so emotional, so vulnerable, so desperate.

""You will die, but now your life is free"" so he talks about being free a lot, and to me, he means being free from yourself, being free from your mind, and all your problems. But I don't think that's what he means here. This is different, and is saying that you are already free. That your life is free. And the thing is, your life IS free. You can do whatever you want, whenever you want. I am not saying without consequences, but you can still do all these things. You can turn your life around, you can get better, you can do whatever you want. So, out of all the things you can do, don't choose to kill yourself. You WILL die someday, but not now. Death is guaranteed, so don't force it. Avoid it all you can. Because once you're dead, that's it. That's the end of the roller coaster. No. Live life all you can.

""Take pride in what is sure to die."" You're sure to die, not now, but someday. Take pride in yourself. You've done so much in your life, even the little things are something to be proud of. Take pride in yourself.

""I will fear the night again"" He's knows it, he's accepted that his depression is a part of his life, and that it affects him at night. He doesn't let it control him, though. He's still hopeful. And if he'd killed himself when he was a teenager, look at what would be different today? Some of us wouldn't even be here. My point is, take a lesson from that. Your life is going to be amazing, but you have to be here to live it, and other people could even benefit from it.

""I hope I'm not my only friend"" He's feeling insecure, like we all do sometimes. I hope I'm not my only friend. I hope other people care about me as much as I care about them. I hope they don't just fade out of my life and leave me all alone. I hope I'm not really just annoying and all my 'friends' aren't just too nice to tell me I'm not theirs. I hope someone else will someday understand me, and that I'm not my only friend.

This is a genius song, and even though it's so simple, it's important, and I love it so much. 

If you are reading this, stay alive. For me.

The beat by Luny Tunes is one of their best. This song got very good airplay in Latin America and is a huge Reggaeton hit,but no video was made. For anyone who has had that crush or maybe more than a crush,but hasnt gotten the courage to say anything,this is your song,Tu Principe or Your Prince.

I think this is the greatest song JBieber has ever sung. I'm not a fan though, I think his other songs are shallow and vain and make no sense. I love that in this song, he's surrendering his love to a girl (or guy, we're not sure). Here are the lines I absolutely adore:


""I wait on you forever any day, hand and foot, your world is my world."" - he's willing to wait for her until the day he'll let him love her

""Baby you won't ever work for nothing"" - because she's only his everything

""You are my ins and my means now"" - she's his only way

""With you there's no inbetween. I'm all in."" - he's not unsure, he has made up his mind

""'Cause my cards are on the table"" - there, he has surrendered his love on the table

""And I'm willing and I'm able"" - he will and he can be in love with her

""But I fold to your wish cause it's my command"" - but if she's not ready to fall in love, she does not want to yet, he will wait for her


well, that's how I see it (or hear it, whatever works)

"
1201,Under Pressure.json,"
I'm pretty sure this song is referring to the pressure of love.  It's about how nobody is immune to the pain love can cause; the world is about love and sometimes relationships can be very hurtful

""It's the terror of knowing what this world is about 
Watching some good friends screaming ""Let me out!""""

He sees all the pain associated with love, and his own love is ""slashed and torn,"" so he tries to turn ""Away from it all like a blind man"".  

But at the end, he realizes you can't turn your back on love, despite the pain.  You have to love people and care for them even if you've been hurt; you have to give love one more chance.

I think most generally the song is about the pressure of conformity and status quo. The pressure is killing us, it's driving us against each and destroying us, but all it takes to get rid of the pressure is to show some genuine love for other people for being who they are. However, showing such love will upset the status quo, and it would require us to move past our own lives, so the same pressure is preventing us from showing simple love.

The song actually explain different kind of pressure.
The first verse being about *your* kind of pressure, might it be work life, school life, family life.

That's OK so far. But there is also the pressure of knowing what happens to other people, whom you can't help. 

Some of the days are just light gray, some are dark gray. That's why it is so easy to ignore the real big problems. Because we are stuck in our own problems. We can try to solve it with love. Brotherly love. If we give love, we can feel we are humans still.

It's our last chance: what else could we give? Only ignorance is easier to give. To turn away from it all like a blind man.

@machinebacon 















I think this song is about depression and suicide. It seems to switch back and forth between someone dealing with depression, and a friend watching them deal with it.

""Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure that brings a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets""

This means the pressure of life effects everyone. The repeating of ""under pressure"" throughout the song is the constant bombardment of stress and pressure in life.

""It's the terror of knowing
What the world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming 'Let me out'""

Seeing the horrors of the world. Of a friend try to kill themselves.

""Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people people on streets""

Always hoping tomorrow will make you feel better. Always hoping you can get out of this rut. Again pressure of life effects everyone ""people on streets"".

""Chippin' around - kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours""

Suicide by gun to the head and depression because everything seems worse than it really is. It's really raining, but you think it's pouring.

""Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn""

Trying to ignore the horror of the world. Siting on the fence is no knowing what to do. So you do nothing, but it's not working in making you feel better. Or doing nothing didn't work in saving someone from suicide. Trying to connect to a person with depression with love, but your love you try to give them just ends up getting mutilated by their world.

""Love love love love love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love give love give love give love""

I think ""love"" means ""love of self"" in some ways. People keep trying to help us, and we keep trying to help ourselves, but Insanity (depression) laughs as we're breaking. We break under pressure. Why can't we give love of ourselves, others, and life another chance?

""'Cause love's such an old fashioned word""

Love is something old fashioned because we haven't felt it in a long time. Love is something that isn't common anymore.

""And love dares you to care for
The people on the (People on streets) edge of the night
And loves (People on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves""

Love for other people makes you reach out for people on the edge of the night Night means death or suicide. Love for others dares you to care about yourself. Self preservation.

""This is our last dance
This is our last dance""

The last time you see someone before they kill themselves. Or the last time you have ever felt happiness.

""This is ourselves""

This is ourselves. This is you, and you only. Meaning we are by ourselves. We are alone dealing with this alone. You can't change yourself. You feel hopeless.
(Ever hear the expression no one can change you but you?) But only you can change your outlook on life.

""Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure""

I think this is the moment someone is on the verge of killing themselves, but it seems ambiguous to me whether or not they go through with it. The song of life is ""under pressure"". Perhaps death is giving into ""pressure"". Or perhaps the person has decided that they are no longer under pressure (depression) and that there is just pressure in the world.

I know queen did another song on suicide, but this is my interpretation, and the lyrics line up pretty good I think. I listened to it extensively when my life was at it's worst. Music was the only thing that made me feel better. But only when I got out of depression, did I realize the meaning of this song and why it had such a connection to me.

Personally I don't like to use the phrase 'This song is about.....' as whatever inspired the lyrics be it cancer, heroine or personal demons it means different things to different people. For me this is one of the most powerful songs ever written, not just by Metallica, but anyone, obviously James Hetfield has drawn on personal anguishes but kept the source of the pain hidden making it easy for each and every one of us to relate it to the lowest point of our lives. 
When I first heard the lyrics I was amazed at how it explained exactly the pain I was currently feeling as if he'd got inside my head and put into words the absolute agony I was suffering, esp 'Hold me until it sleeps' suggesting that I'd get through but never exorcise the underlying causes. I hope i've made sense!! You can see why I need lyrics to express myself, I just cant project the same depth of emotion!

Either way this is my favourite Metallica song and possibly fave song ever.

I RUN BUT IT STAYS RIGHT BY MY SIDE
he tries to escape the addiction but he cannot

DONT WANT IT, WANT IT, WANT IT, NO....SO TEAR ME OPEN BUT BEWARE...
the point in addiction where you know you shouldnt do it and you know its bad, but the horrible temptation is there and you give in

THERES THINGS INSIDE THAT SCREAM AND SHOUT
inside him he knows he is torn because of the addiction;this embodies his two sides, the sane and addicted sides, providing almost a bi-polarity

I was thinking what HijoDelMetallica wrote. Clearly it's about the struggle to overcome an addiction (more generally, it could also refer to compulsive, destructive behavior).

There's nothing in this song to suggest anything regarding cancer, so I'm not quite sure where others are getting that from (other than some mysterious quote from James than no one seems to have a link to).

Ive heard that this song is about the death of James's dad, i think from cancer.  But i think it also goes deeper than that.  It has to do with general interal pain and loss and the inablily to make sense or cope with it.  But if youve ever seen the video, which was based on a painting, you've seen the recuring scenes of Jesus's death and Adam and Eve's fall from grace.  To me it represents the redemption given by Chirst's sacrifice on the cross and the remorse of having sinned.  Its one of their best songs i think and has comforted me in tough times.  I cant get enough of it.

I think MuminPL is right on the money, I've never seen an interview with them before, but I noticed in one of their albums, they list Akira Yamaoka as an influence, he did all the soundtracks to silent hill.  
If you look at the lyrics to this song, everything points to Silent Hill The Room, 302 is the apartment that it's set in,(used to be my 302), and holes appear in the walls (peering through the hole) that the character travels through into Silent Hill,  the character finds that he is locked within his apartment and looks through the spyhole and watches his neighbours knocking on his door, i think the character has weird dreams too (reccuring dreams) and of course there's the darkness that is Silent Hill that manifests itself within the apartment.  
If you have seen the video aswell, there are visual elements that reference The Room, eg: a revolving door, decaying building, a bathtub (more SH3).
To summarize, although I am guessing, I think the evidence is clear.

I have heard of Riverside thru Myspace, They're unique and good.
So is 302 a room number? it's kinda confusing. I guess he was going thru something that turned out fake? :-\ so metaphorically speakin he was in a room sheltered and all but it was not where he wants to be, not where he belongs?
The final acoustic part is amazing, it explains itself.

			I really don't think this has anything to do with Silent Hill. The hole he is peering through is the peephole in his dorm or apartment door. And he is looking out in hopes of catching a glimpse of the girl he lusts for. The stuff about problems sleeping is just because he is a troubled man.

Ok so I am not really sure what this song is about, but I think the dude feels safe when he's asleep but must come to terms with himself while he's awake because he's tired of hiding from himself. Oh and 302 is the number you call when you want to put someone in a psychiatric facility, it's kinda like 911 but for the psych. hospital.

@Soulite 















the song is definitely about silent hill. if you've played silent hill 4 you would see how the first part of lyrics explain the antagonist's situation in the game. but the second part of the song stray from the antagonist and , in my opinion, are the song writer's complementary interpretation to the life of one of the less centered, though compelling characters of the game,one of the neighbors.an portrait artist, who lives alone doing nothing but painting portraits of neighbors trying to capture the essence of their lives in each painting. although i love the silent hill music and especially in silent hill 4. i think this song is a very nice change of pace. a brilliant song for a brilliant game.

The first single, the title song, is currently sitting at the #6 position on the Billboard Hot 100 but today, the multi talented artist is unleashing a new song ‘Versace On The Floor’ which comes along with the pre-order of the LP on iTunes.The song has already hit some international iTunes stores while U.S. fans will be able to download it later tonight. For now, stream the seductive slow jam right here. This tastes like mocktail of Prince and Michael Jackson sounds.

"

Maynard is a man who know much about psychology, and I totally agree with him on this one. The civilized mankind today is overprotected. Yet we feel unsafe, and most of all bored. To keep our mind of things we watch television and read the paper to hear the news from this world. 
What Maynard wants to say is that: WHY IS THE MOST INTERESTING STORIES IN THE NEWS THE SAD AND HORRIBLE ONES? People feel safe when they hear about other peoples deaths. And thet need to hear it. It is something satisfying about it in a non-maschistic way. Don't get me wrong here... we aren't vicous killers. 
This world is filled with violence. We hate it, but we love to hate it. 

Think about it... When you see a newspaper with a big fat title ""Stabbed by husband."" you don't go like ""hm... who cares."" You grab it, buy it, read it, and go ""I'm glad that wasen't me."" og ""pfft! what are the odds of that happening to me?"" Then you go on with your life with one less worry. 

Violence is like pornograhpy for your mind. 

I hope you understand.
and please don't get for a murderer, or a suicidel dumbnut ;)

@KeeperOfTool 















BrainNevelle, if you just want to hear Maynard sing without the other 3 members then you aren't a Tool fan. Tool is one of if not the best band out there because of all it's members. Danny Carey may be the best drummer ever, and without his complex and powerful polyrythms Tool and Maynard would have no backbone to their songs. Same goes for the gripping and thundering guitar riffs and baselines by Adam Jones and  Justin Chancellor. You have no right to call anyone a fake fan.. if people are true fans, they listen to the whole band. Not just Maynard, don't get me wrong, I still think he is a god, but you have to get the whole picture. If Maynard wanted himself to be more prominent he would have done so. You probably have no appreciation for songs like Reflection on Lateralus.

@aefong44 Reflection and Lateralus are great songs. Maynard's vocals are really good... Why wouldn't BrainNevelle like those songs? I didn't read his comment... but I got the feeling that he's basically just a Maynard fan.

Regarding what BrainNeville has pointed out, I also agree that vocals in the song are on the background. But this is not something new for Tool at all. There are many examples where Maynard used his voice like an ""instrument with words"". My examples would be Reflection, You Lied, No Quarter and parts of other songs to. 

Interviews have also shown that Tool has aimed to use Maynard's voice like an instrument via effects and tricks. My counter argument is that we have to stop idealizing Maynard which makes us unable to concentrate on the music that these 4 talents make. 

This is teamwork and why do we always have to see an idol, a frontman. Maynard is no Kurt Cobain. It's his style. Every single individual in Tool sees that all the other guys have suplendid talents and they like to present the whole picture. I appreciate and agree that Maynard has a extraordinarily divine voice and love listening to him like I'm hearing messeages from above. 

However, due to the reason that Maynard is not a frontman in Tool, and should not be, Maynard's voice should not override those of others. And still, I believe there are adequate (although when it comes to Maynard I never get enough) songs to hear him. 

I hope this new album will be another chance to hear Maynard's voice both infront of all others and as an instrument by himself. I take it either way.

@cherbe 















This is more down to earth than usual from Maynard. It hits hard because it is not about hidden meanings. At first, the lack of mystery is almost disappointing for a die-hard. But the song itself is devastating and true tool. The meaning, as I see it: we consume information about the world's tragedies like vultures because, in part, it satisfies a need of ours. Why can't we just admit it? Because this vicariousness is horribly shameful. So we (la, la, la) lie about it. Maynard tells us to accept the truth, though, he really doesn't need or want to 'say it all again'.
This is a song about a human need that Maynard thinks is timeless ('so it is, so it's always been'): living vicariously off other people's tragedy. He does not hope for change, he demands recognition of this ailment. Because maybe we really should be ashamed.

			I don't think there's anything shameful about being fascinated by violence/death/evil. I can't speak for other living things, but we as humans are conscious of our own mortality. Our curiosity seeks to understand it, while our instinct for self-preservation fears it. Since we can't explore it personally and survive to understand it, we can only examine death through the deaths of other people. The same with violence and cruelty. Most of us don't care to experience it first hand, so the only way to learn about it is vicariously. We are fascinated out of fear... ""Neither the brave nor bold were writers of the stories told""... what would I do if this happened to me? It can also provide a way to empathize with others and see that we all share the same fears. It seems the shameful thing is that the media has capitalized on this basic need within us and turned it into a way to profit. That's why there is so much violence in movies, tv shows, music, books, etc... The problem seems to be desensitization due to overexposure to it. Just look at the news! And in a way we find pleasure in the desensitization, because it numbs us from the fear. Like ""junkies staring at a screen"", the more we watch the more we feel safe in accepting violence and death, because we've already 'experienced' it. It also exposes our lack of desire to do as Davesz mentioned. Most people don't care until it affects their life personally. We naturally prefer to look out for ourselves rather than look out for others, which is part of why there is so much violence. We haven't evolved to a point of communal ""hippy"" thinking, and perhaps it's counter-intuitive to our nature. That's what I get out of it anyway!

@lipanconjuring I think the line ""so it is, so it's always been"" is actually referring more to the concept of eternal return, not just humanity. ""The universe is hostile, so impersonal, devour to survive."" Everything in the universe is constantly being broken down, from the cells in our bodies to the elements in stars. It has been in a constant state of cycling since its existence, it devours itself, and because we are part of the universe it devours us as well, it's nothing personal. I'm not sure if that's what he was referring to in the song but that's what I got out of the song. Basically, we live in fear of death, we read these events that happen in horror, glued to the screen petrified like ""I'm glad that wasn't me"" and finding satisfaction in the fact we survive when in reality death is just a part of life and there is nothing to be afraid of.

Simple enough, as human beings we watch others to judge our own behaviour in comparison. The problem is that in today's 24 hour media society we've become obsessed with the miniutae of watching others suffer but we can do it ""from a safe distance"" and no one needs to know how much we enjoy it.TV, newspapers, websites, it's all there, all the gory, nasty detail we could ever want to revel in and with no strings attached! You ask anyone if they enjoyed it and they will all say, ""Oooh no! It's disgusting and tragic. I can't understand why."", just admit you enjoyed watching someone else suffer and be thankful it wasn't you!

Brilliant track.

@fuzzypiggy 















When this album first came out I was listening to Vicarious while driving. I was stuck in traffic behind a taxi that had an advertisement on it for an exhibition called ""The Human Body"", where various aspects of the body are studied and put on display, like muscle/bone structures, skin fibres, vital organs etc etc. Funnily enough, the photo on the ad was very much like the cover of Lateralus, with the photo of a human being illustrating the layers beneath the skin.
What really caught my attention were the words in bold italic underneath the image: ""REAL BODIES ON DISPLAY""

This song really made sense to me after I saw that: I could picture people at the exhibition bypassing all the fake plastic skeletons, respiratory system drawings, etc etc, and heading straight for the ""real bodies"" where they would stand in droves and ""stare like zombies"" at this dead body on the table. 

I could also imagine that people ""wouldn't give pause"" to even consider going to the exhibition until they learn that real dead bodies are on display. And the fact that the advertisers found it necessary to even mention it on the ad as if that makes the whole experience more ""appealing"".

But the funny thing is: I am no different. I would have been there front row centre, looking at the dead body. Even though it's wrong, you can't help but look. ""Why can't we just admit it?""

We are all ""Part vampire, Part warrior. Carnivore and voyeur."" We are infatuated at the misfortune and suffering of others. ""Like blood to a vampire""

What genius. Thank you Tool.

Anyway, I was late to work that day. But who cares!!!

One last parting thought: Think about all those times you watch TV, or watch a movie, or even watch a motor race and hope for a crash, a murder scene, etc. We are all monsters. We just need to admit it.

Incredible song, I'm pretty sure it's about how we all sit on the couch, hypnotized, watching TV and all the tragedies that are broadcasted that we take pleasure in viewing. Vicarious shows a sarcastic view of this.

The song isn't about getting up and doing something though, Luca303. It isn't about thinking we're better off than the people we watch on TV.


The song is about how we all love to watch the garbage on TV, even though many refuse to admit. There's no point judging people who relish in it; we can't change.

These lyrics are not correct, try these ones.... the only thing that might not be 100% is the, ""She used a poison, in his tea, and kissed him goodbye"" but I know it's not ""he used to poison, and in his dreams"" or whatever you got up here, another thing, it's, ""Credulous, Divest"" not ""Credulous at best""

Tool - Vicarious 

Eye on the T.V. 'cause tragedy thrills me. 
Whatever flavor it happens to be like.. 
""Killed by the husband"", 
""Drowned by the ocean"", 
""Shot by his own son"", 
""She used the poison in his tea 
and kissed him goodbye"". 
That's my kinda story. 
It's no fun until someone dies. 

Don't look at me like I am a monster. 
Thrown out your one face, 
But with the other. 
Stare like a junkie into the T.V.. 
Stare like a zombie, 
While the mother holds her child. 
Watches him die. 
Pleads to the sky crying: 
""Why, oh why?"" 

Cause I need to watch things die... from a distance. 
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies. 
You all need it too - don't lie. 

Why can't we just admit it? 
Why can't we just admit? 

We won't give pause until the blood is flowing. 
Neither the brave nor bold, or writers of stories told. 
We won't give pause until the blood is flowing. 

I need to watch things die.. from a good safe distance. 
Vicariously I live while the whole world dies. 
You all feel the same so.. 

Why can't we just admit it? 

Blood like rain come down. 
Drown on grave and ground. 

Part vampire. 
Part warrior. 
Carnivore and voyeur. 
Stare at the transmitter. 
Sing to the death rattle. 

Lie (4x) 

(Background news headline) 

Credulous, divest your desire to believe in 
Angels in the hearts of men. 
Pull your head on out. 
Your head believes it give a listen. 
Shouldn't have to say it all again. 
The universe is hostile, 
So impersonal. 
Devour to survive, so it is, 
So it's always been. 

We all feed on tragedy. 
It's like blood to a vampire. 

Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies. 
Much better you than I.

I think the guy doesn't care for her much - she's trying to get him to love her. Trying to convince them: ""They say that the world was built for two, Only worth living if somebody is loving you""

Trying to persuade him with perfumes, big kisses, getting undressed, pretending to be a 'bad girl'. But he keeps playing the videogames... 

She even tries to like the videogames too, but I think she knows that the guy doesn't really like her. He is ignoring her.

			The fact that she references the song Fast Car cleverly tells you in two words all you need to know about the guy she's in love with.  

The singer of Fast Car fell in love with a guy, and ran away with him from her deadbeat father, only to find that he was just as bad.  I guess she's implying by saying he drives a fast car that he's like the guy in that song - a deadbeat.

I think this a melancholy tune about a girl who loves a guy who isn't that nice to her.  She tries to please him wearing his favourite dress and perfume.  ""whistling my name"" suggest he calls to her and she runs to him like a dog to his master.  They lyrics ""Watching me get undressed Take that body downtown"" suggest at a darkness.  ""They say that the world was built for two Only worth living if somebody is loving you"" suggest that she thinks she will only be happy if she is with someone.

@spearmintlilo 















I'm going to give my opinion on video games, and I've probably listened to the song over a hundred times. When the song first came out I remember reading an interview or article where Lana explains how it's about two people. One guy she's actually currently in a relationship with. The other is an old relationship that she's obviously still thinking about the guy, and wishing things had turned out differently. She went onto say that the verses are about how it actually was with the one guy and then the chorus is how she actually wished it had been with the previous relationship. From the lyrics you can grasp that the current relationship is kind of becoming tedious. But if you actually pay attention to the lyrics you will pick up that she uses two different possessive adjectives ""his"" and ""your"". With that in mind if you look at the lyrics it makes sense because even though she's with one guy everything she's doing subconsciously is for the other. 



Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car whistling my name 
Open up a beer
And you say get over here and play a video game
(This is what actually happened.. ""your"")

I'm in his favorite sun dress 
Watching me get undressed take that body downtown
(She's in his, meaning the other guys favorite sundress)

I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss put his favorite perfume on
(She says he's the best and is putting on a facade of total happiness, yet she still puts the other guys favorite perfume on)

Like previously stated the chorus is about the old relationship and how she wished it had been. It correlates with how she referenced it in the verses, how she's doing things for the other guy even though she's in a relationship with the one. She's putting on his favorite sundress and perfume. 

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do

Even though she's in one relationship, she's still doing everything for the old one.

@coco1323 















According to an article posted on the website Dazed Digital:

At the same time, she was dealing with the fallout from two broken relationships, so she took Parker’s template and wrote down what was on her mind.

“The verse was about the way things were with one person, and the chorus was the way that I wished things had really been with another person, who I thought about for a long time,” she says, breaking into an acapella of the song. “‘Swinging in the backyard, pull up in your fast car, whistling my name’. That was what happened, you know? He’d come home and I’d see him. But then the chorus, ‘Heaven is a place on earth with you, tell me all the things you wanna do’ wasn’t like that. That was the way that I wished it was — the melody sounds so compelling and heavenly because I wanted it to be that way. The verse is more matter-of-fact because that’s how it was. It’s a mix of memories and the way I wished it could have been. Just because things happened a certain way doesn’t mean that that’s the way that they are. It really is what you choose to think about. Bad things happen every day but you’re not going to be any happier thinking about them. So I don’t think about them. I don’t have that luxury any more. Some people say that ‘Video Games’ stops them in their tracks; it’s that kind of song. It’s just really sad.""

@wednesday181 Good info. It's worth noting that if you had the ability to insert your wishes into the fabric of a harsh reality you could control it - like life is a video game. 			

According to Lana herself:
""It’s just about this guy I had been seeing and the way our relationship was at the time. It was a time in my life when I had let go of my own personal career ambitions and just enjoyed being with him at home when he’d come home from work and play video games. I’d write while I’d watch him. I think when I wrote that song I was just reflecting on the sweetness of it, but also the fact that there was something else I was longing for at the same time. Thematically, it feels personal to me. I wouldn’t have thought that that was the song that people responded to. That is why I get so emotional and happy when I sing it. Because it is a gift for someone like me. Melodically and thematically, Video Games is a perfect representation of me.""

@karolinaa do you have a link to the source??			

I'm kind of saddened by all these dark/negative interpretations... I was feeling a melancholic happiness, but not emotional abuse. The song is kind of ruined for me now...

I was feeling a melancholy towards a simple happiness. When putting on his favorite dress made her feel like a million dollars, and happiness was in the little things; hanging out together, having fun with friends. When at the end of the day, happiness was simple, and now she has bigger worries.

I could relate to it because me and my boyfriend have a lot of financial struggle at the moment, but still happiness seems such a strong and simple thing when we play video games together or have drinks with our wonderful friends and family. That dispite the sorrows we carry, maling ourselves and each other happy together with little things is still possible. We can't buy new clothes but when I put on that dress we both love I still feel like the richest woman on earth.

I guess people hear what they can relate to. No doubt I would have heard more sadness in it two years ago when I was still involved with an emotionally abusive guy. It's all about where your own mind is at, too. I just hear ""heaven is a place on earth with you"" above all other insinuations.

			I also think that there is something darker going on...something we won't find in the lyrcis. I think Lana Del Rey is telling us a true tragedy and only she knows the true extent and meaning. I do not mean that Lana herself has experienced it, but she knows, in our world are stories, like the one she tolds us in her song. 

I absolutely agree with laurajaneface.

I feel like this song was was written for a couple who were deeply in love but lost each other. ""They say that the world was built for two. Only worth living if somebody is loving you."" ""Heaven is place on Earth with you."" I love this song. It's such a beautifully tragic story, being in love with someone you can't be with, losing the one you love.

Can't believe there are no comments for this! Oh well, I'll be the first. Virginia Bluebell is a song that I believe no-one can listen to without being touched and inspired. She is trying to tell her friend, who has been hurt/torn apart/lost/afraid/depressed/and has suffered from a lack of belief in herself, ""to look up and let the world see all the beauty that you're made of."" It's a sad song, but also an uplifting one. She is trying to show that no matter what has happened, is happening or will happen, she will always be there and the person she's singing to will always be her Virginia Bluebell. Her vocals are absolutely stunning and the first time I heard it I had tears in my eyes. The lines, ""Put a little light in the darkest places. Put a little smile on the saddest faces"" Show that this girl/woman clearly has a beautiful personality and presence and that she just has to find the strength to show it again.

High everyone!  I think the song is about herself.  It's about searching for the perfect person to fulfill your life only to discover that that person is you.  It is about being true to yourself, to your dreams, to you.  It's about finding out that the ""perfect person"" might not be what you envisioned.  Believe in yourself...be somebody!  That's my take... I relate to the song that way.

Finding yourself is the ""Sweet Destiny"".

In the verses she is talking about the past and how hard it was, and how she seeked a perfect love and needed security, the chorus's are in the present saying that this ""someone"" had brought her love and it was all she dreamed, and wanted!

I Believe this is about God's love and how, after years of praying, her prayers have been answered in a ""Vision of Love.""  She is grateful for what God has given her, and I think she is specifically talking about the opportunity and talent to launch her music career - but it could be anything.  This was the song that got Mariah noticed first, back in the days when she was still humble, about 1992 or so?

Well, I've always thought of it like a girl's wishing of meeting a dreamlike lover...and suddenly her dream becomes reality and destiny brings her a vivid example of everything she had been dreaming of, or even more than that. 
It's a beautiful song to hear when you've haven't experienced anything...when it still feels look unspoiled and pure.

Carey obviously depicts having a ""vision of love."" She is grateful to God (not a lover, as some may assume) for guiding her in life. Carey describes how she had to work to get where she is now, but with the help of the vision that she received from God. It is an autobiographical piece, penned by Carey herself, that includes the personal struggles she had endured through time as she worked to fulfill her dream/""vision.""

Great song!!!! Powerful song. Her first release!!! wow.. how I wish I had've been a teenager when this was released!!! I was around 8, lol. Would have been so exciting when mariah first came onto the music scene!!!! There's no one like her!!! Her voice is out of this world. She is beyond talented!!! She sounds so free in this song, I love it. She is just so blessed and gifted.
I lovvvve her big curly hair back then!!! wow. She was gorgeous!!! More naturally pretty.
Yeah, she was so humble back then.
Anyway... i'll always love her!!!! This is an awesome classic!!!!!!!

She found someone she likes but finally realizes that she projected on this person what he wasn't - her true love. You know the drill; you meet someone, sparks fly, you fall in love, then after a series of let downs, realize that this person isn't ""The One"".

@queleche 















No this song isnt about a loved one or finding love... its about her Music and how she survived by it. If you really listen to the lyrics you'll will understand it better... read below

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny: Her music is her destiny
Carried me through desperation: Music helped her through the hard times (I can totally relate)
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long 
but still i believed
somehow the one that i needed
would find me eventually: To the person she wanted to be
I had a Vision of Love: The Vision of Love is her touching an audience with her voice... if you watch her live from 2006 onwards you will see how she waves her hand out from the left of the audience to the right

Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So i believed
And now i know ive succeeded
In finding a place i conceived : The place she conceived is the music in her where she can turn too any time and it will make her feel better

I realised a dream
And i visualized the love that came to be: Her dream was to become an artist and she fell in love with it

Cause you treated me kind
Sweet destiny: Her music treated her kind and it is her destiny

Does this song make sense now... this is my perspective of the song and the reason its my favorite song of all time... cause i can totally relate...

please reply

I think this song is about being in denial about loving someone.

All the things he says like: ""I can feel you watching even when you're nowhere to be seen
I can feel you touching even when you're far away from me
Every time I see you, I don't know why my heart begins to race
Every time I leave, I don't know why my heart begins to break"" those are all symptoms of being in love.

And this is so new to the person, that they think it some sort of spell because it is such a strong feeling.

I agree with crysticreme. The line ""I'm saying things I never say"" enforces that too. 
It's like they're never the type to become seriously into someone else, so they just don't understand why they're doing things they've never desired to do before. Love the idea of the song.

For me it sounds like the person gets everything they could ever dream of but there's still this empty hole they can't fill and it's because they aren't really ""awake"" enough to realize that it's about the journey not the destination. That you can't find happiness in the things you get, but recognizing the beauty in everything in your life even the challenges and obstacles we face.

It's about getting the short end of the stick in a relationship. Wanting someone more than they want you, finally realizing this is the source of the problem to begin with. The person feels let down because they were the one who was more emotionally invested in the relationship:

""I kept waitin on a reason, in a call that never came"" --Wasting time waiting for someone to change, to suddenly put as much effort into it as you are, only realizing after time that it's not going to happen, because you want this to work more than they do.

""In the end it seemed, there was no room for me, still I tried to change your mind"" --Subconciously, the person knows that holding on is a lost cause, but at the same time is bound to them by the flickering hope that there is still something left in the relaitonship.

In the end, you see the person finally realizing and adressing the problem to the relationship (""I guess I wanted you more""), now understanding that it is unfair to themselves to remain in a relationship that is not fully benefitting them.

This song relates to me so much it's scary.
I believe this song is about a guy that just stops talking to the girl, randomly. (""I kept waitin' on a reason -that he just stopped talking to her-, a call that never came"") She doesn't know why and she had her hopes up so high that this guy was perfect for her and they were going to be together forever, but it turns out that she had just wanted him more. She says she ""should have seen the signs"" and that she was ""just too blind"" and he apparently didn't have room in his heart for her.

This song seems like it's pretty much written for me. I went through something like this and I was that girl. It's sad and it hurts that someone could just wake up one morning and never talk to you again.. and you have no reason why they did that.

A ""real"" relationship doesn't work out. They are pondering the reasons and decide it is because according to each and their p.o.v they worked harder then the other-they wanted the other more then the other did them...??But then they don't need the other anymore.

When I hear this song, I'm thinking of a man who is training his apprentice. But he knows that soon he will have to leave his pupil (most likely dying), and as his final piece of advice, he's telling him of the legacy that he and his people has left, and that eventually the youth will take up that torch, and that he's ready for it.

This song reminds me of America (my favorite song from Night Visions). I think it's about a revolution (perhaps the American Revolution), and the song is one revolutionary talking to another like a mentor:

""As a child you would wait
And watch from far away.
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play.""

That last line for me means that the people seemed to ignore what was going on, and just went with it. The revolutionaries would have to change things (That work while they all play) It could also be an allusion to the fact that the British exploited the Americans to pay off their war debt.

""In youth you'd lay
Awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change,
But it was just a dream!""

Pretty straightforward. The revolutionaries wished for change individually but, without assembling, it seemed as a dream. The dream could also be their goal.

""Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust.""

Awesome chorus. It just says to keep hope and faith in what you do. (If we continue in the American revolution subject, the town could be a metaphor for the US)

""The time will come
When you'll have to rise
Above the best and prove yourself,
Your spirit never dies!""

Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above,
But don't weep for me
'Cause this will be
The labor of my love""

The mentor has died, perhaps from fighting the revolution. He prays that the other revolutionary will take his place, continue the fight and be courageous.

To me, this song is really about overcoming.  This became especially apparent while working through a somewhat deep depression a while back.  Before, especially as a kid, all I ever saw it as was a victory song to be played after a sporting event or something of that sort.  It had no meaning to me beyond that.  Because of that, I always kind of overlooked it because of how overplayed it seemed to be.  In the thick of it, while I was on the verge of tears, it came on the radio and I actually started really LISTENING to the lyrics.

That's when the overcoming theme hit me.  Maybe it's kind of obvious to a lot of you, but for me it took a while.  Now, when I hear him say ""We are the champions,"" I'm not envisioning a guy scoring a last minute goal.  The ""we"" Freddy Mercury is singing about is actually you and me.  If you've ever had a time where you felt like laying down, giving up, dying, but you're still here.  You're not giving up.  You're going to stick through to the end.  You're going to get right back up every time life throws you to the ground and keep fighting, no matter how big a challenge is standing before you.  No matter how hopeless your goal may seem.  That's how you're a true champion.

Thank you Freddy, for your encouraging words.  They've helped me through tough times more than you could know.  May you rest in peace.

			You are completely right, my friend. Couldn't have put it better.			

Heh...so many people complain about this being used as a sports anthem (including me) but Freddie actually wrote it as a sports anthem: ""...I was thinking about football when I wrote it. I wanted a participation song, something the fans could latch on to. It was aimed at the masses; I thought we'd see how they took it. It worked a treat. When we performed it at a private concert in London, the fans actually broke into a football chant between numbers. Of course, I've given it more theatrical subtlety than an ordinary football chant. You know me."" Though he said he may also have been commenting on Queen's success: ""I suppose it could also be construed as my version of 'I Did It My Way.' We have made it, and it certainly wasn't easy. No bed of roses as the song says. And it's still not easy."" (queen.musichall.cz/…) Though all of the other meanings of the song could still apply, even if they weren't what Freddie originally intended.

Anyone here who claims this song is about homosexuality makes themselves look ignorant and small minded, not to mention probably prejudiced in some cases. I think it's obvious what this song is about; it's that fighting spirit, rising to the challenge when the going gets tough and giving the finger to difficult people who judge us for what we are but not who we are. In other words refusing to quit, lie down

			Agree.  Being an uncloseted sexual minority (he was *bi*, people!) is an obvious example of a challenge people face since, as you put it so succinctly, a lot of people ""judge us for what we are but not who we are.""  But I agree that the underlying meaning of this song is a lot broader than just his one particular case, especially relevant though it may be for both Freddie and much of his audience.
(Curiously, people also tend to assume that R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe is gay when he's actually bi (and has never made a secret of it).  I wonder what causes this sort of thing to happen.  Sometimes I think bisexuality has been kind of ""forgotten"" by the media & pop culture – even though Woody Allen once said he couldn't understand why more people weren't by, because it'd double your chances for a date on Saturday night.)

This is basically Queen giving the finger to all those ppl who put them down and said a band wif a gay front-man would get no where. 

Their biggest critics were the ""good folks"" from 'News Of The World' tabloid. I guess its no wonder they named the album 'News Of The World.' ;-)

It's obviously a gay anthem, and about struggling as a closeted homosexual, which many gay men of that time did. What else are the lines 

""I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime""

about then? Explain. It's about living in a closet, when society hates your guts. Doing a sentence, time after time. Which was the reality for gay people especially in the past. How else you're gonna explain these first 4 lines? What sentences you've been doing, as a straight person? Closeted gay people know all about it. People are really blind if they don't see this :D 

Obviously Freddie wouldn't say it aloud, he never admitted being gay either. It was the hidden, true meaning of the song. He probably laughed in his mind about the football explanation. If he told what's it really about, it wouldn't have been as popular, and never adopted as a sports anthem.

WOW!  i love this song for so many reasons.  i knew it was a song that my baby liked and then we had some problems and every time i heard this song i just thought about them even more.  just everything about it reminds me of how i was feeling without this special person in my life.  i love my baby so much.  and this song is all that could keep me going through those rough times and now everything's all good and i'm so happy once again.  i love my baby so much and it's because of this song that i can be myself once again.  i love you sean!!!

The chorus gives away what the song is about.

""You're a... rockstar (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Playa... Who can really blame you? (who can really blame you?)
We're the ones who made you""

This is basically saying ""don't forget that you got really famous because of your comedy songs and celebrity bashing"" or that Eminem would be nothing without the celebrities he's made fun of.

@Ocelocity 















ok kids
this may be the least amount of swearing he has ever done in a song bar just the two of us/'97 bonnie & clyde. this song was released one day after it was announced that lindsay lohan and sam broke up which makes the joke outdated before the song was released. the female vocal is dina rae who has appeared on track 13 of eminem's previous albums, i REALLY hope this song is track 13. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…. it would be great if eminem could go back to his roots but he can't for two simple reasons, he can't rap about being poor or street because he is not anymore and would be a poser and a hypocrite for always bashing on fake people like fred durst and everlast. he also gave up making explicit drug references when he stopped doing hard drugs i believe between devils night and eminem show in 2001. my opinion? easy to listen to because it is new and the boy can rap, but disappointing because lyrically it's a collection of name drops and a fart sound.

Great song, although a little sad. It's about losing a dream (a relationship) due to being unable to voice ones feelings for another. When he was with her he felt he had it all (""we owned the night""). Whenever he looks upward to the sky he thinks of her and what he had (and lost). Apparently when he needed to act (to speak) the words escaped him...and she him. First listen to this band. I like 'em.

jeez.....you guys are all nuts. Here is what the song really means......it a three different snapshots of one mans life....as a boy....a young man and an old man.....as a boy He is playing.....kicking his can all over the place...refers to a childrens game called kick the can....waving your banner all over the place and the blood on your face line refers to the fact that many young folk get involved in causes,factions and the like when they still are motivated by idealism and finally as an old man who has come full circle,back to his childhood.both the first verse and the last includes the line...mud on your face....as an old man he hasn't changed a thing hence he is a disgrace.....this has nothing to do with gay rights or any of that shit. I find it amusing that gays wrap themselves in the cloak of Queen music to espouse their lifestyle.I am no homophobe but I find it tedious that Gays wanna find some gay reference in almost every queen song.Get a fucking clue.

@MoonlitKnight There's a bit more to it, the main character is obviously a rebel and seen as a disgrace by society. Seeming particularly worse off in old age. It seems fairly open-ended and could be about anyone who doesn't fit into society including someone who's gay or perhaps not. Most lyricists tend to allow some degree of interpretation by the listener. What the song isn't about is the average person getting through life.

@MoonlitKnight Especially since Freddie didn't write all or even most of the lyrics. Brian May wrote the song all by himself. Some people think Another One Bites The Dust is about AIDS. John Deacon wrote that one and it's quite possible he didn't even know what AIDS was at the time he wrote the song. I've even heard that Bohemian Rhapsody is about AIDS. Literally nobody knew what AIDS was when Freddie wrote that song. The only song that Freddie wrote about AIDS was I'm Going Slightly Mad which was a witty, humorous take on the cognitive decline he was suffering at the time. I've also heard people say The Great Pretender is about Freddie being gay or something like that. It was a freaking cover song from the 1950s, LOL.

@MoonlitKnight This drives me crazy too. Brian and Freddie wrote equal amounts of songs with John and Roger usually putting in one song on an album in the 70s. This changed to usually 3 Brian/3 Freddie and the other 3 or 4 Roger or John in the 80s until The Miracle where they worked more collaboratively. I find the fact so many people seem to think Freddie wrote them all annoying. From what I understand, We Will Rock You was completely written by Brian. After their concert at Bingley Hall where the audience was particularly participatory and loud, he had the ""stomp, stomp, clap"" come into his head with the idea of a song they could participate in. The words were 100% written by him, in typical Brian May style in which there is a bit of a story to it with a beginning, middle and end (following a man from boyhood, to idealistic young adult, to unhappy old man). Even the stomp, stomp, claps are very Brian (and his overly scientific genius brain) in that he hand calculated a logarithm to figure out how to make the sound of about 10 people stomping on boards sound and have the reverberation of an entire concert hall stomping. Freddie just sang it (perfectly by the way). If people want to discuss gay referencing songs from Queen, you have your choice of several Freddie songs including Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy, Don't Stop Me Now, Get Down Make Love, and pretty much all Freddie songs on Hot Space. He did do several songs about yearning for love, without directly referencing being gay but he was singing about finding a man such as Somebody to Love, It's A Hard Life, Crazy Little Thing Called Love. However, as Freddie said several times, he found lyrics hard to write and thought of them as throw away in a lot of cases. I suspect there is a lot of songs everyone is trying to find deep meaning to that he didn't have deep meaning behind.

Hey, this is my first post here, I'm surprised to see that people seem to be confused about this song, for me the meaning is clear. Ok the way I always thought of this song is that it is about a Revolution.

Freddy Mercury is the Voice of the Ruler (a King or Dictator or something) and he is speaking to a crowd of Protestors (Revolutionaries), He's trying to bring them down, saying things you're a ""big disgrace"". The People respond with just shouting ""We Will Rock You!"", meaning We Will Bring you down or We Will Overthrow you!

""Waving your banner all over the place"" Clearly the crowd is carrying Revolutionary banners.

""Buddy you're an old man poor man 
Pleading with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day 
You got mud on your face 
You big disgrace 
Somebody better put you back into your place""

This bit shows this clearly, the poor people are rising up and their ruler says get back into your place. i.e. I'm in charge you're just a lowly peasant.

I assume that in the end the people storm the Ruler's palace and overthrow him.
To me this is defiantly an anti-authority song, I don't know if my interpretation is 100% correct but that's the way I've always imagined this song.

@Hibernian dream intoxicide of the only seperation			

I just recently saw my 1/2 brother, and he was an 70's child so I asked him what he thought the song meant. He said ""I don't know, but I remember that they always played it at any sports thing for like 5 minutes, and everyone would just keep saying 'We will, we will rock you!'"". So even though I do think that this song is a representation of the different stages of life, I think it's just a nice song to listen to when your in the mood for rock. :)

5/11/05 Hi, I'm 52, which gives you an idea of the generation that I grew up in (Beatles, Stones, etc.) I LOVE this song followed by Champions, but I really don't understand the lyrics. Who is stomping whom? Are those with mud on their faces, at different ages, different generations (in one time frame? or at different time frames, meaning the same boy, man and old man???), stomping, fighting our society? Or, is Queen telling us that ""they,"" the men represented in the lyrics, deserve to be stomped? If so, exactly WHY?  And why is this song followed by The Champions? Did Queen mean that those who thought that the boy, man, old man in We Will Stomp You, to be annhiliated, socially, then would be ""stomped"" out by the champions of the world?  Please enlighten me. I always blast this song and The Champions, but am confused as to its true meaning...  Thoughts from the gallery???

So many people do that whole gay champ thing with these lyrics.....ITS A RED HERING people.
I also agree thats its 3 different stages of this dudes life
The last part seems to suggest that as an old man, he has now lost touch with what the youth want as they have their own generational agenda thats far removed from his, hence being put in his place, and thought of as a disgrace.

Yes it is the classic 3 stages of life, wasting it, ruling it, and just living in it

I think that all songs will mean something different to all..you know ""Eye Of the Beholder"" type shit.
This song talks to me about my mental ilneess of being bipolar.
I feel alot of the rage and being misunderstood as crazy when in fact I am not. The word mental illness gives people a certain image that is just not fuckin'true.There are different degrees of everything.
Being ""Labeled mentally deranged"" but by who?
I have read alot of these lyrics from day one and with the most recent St Anger song ""Unnamed Feeling"" get the impression that James might be BP also.It lad me to drug abuse to change my moods I didn't like and try and keep people away.
One problem with BPdisorder is that you ""cycle"" these feelings and moods can't be controlled.There is no cure.  
So i tcan seem that time stands still at times and no one leaves, it's always there.
I know this isn't a very fuckin' metal explination but believe me I am VERY metal.This is just a song that gives a point of view from someone that has been called mentally ill and is being forced to see that his views on things are wrong.Finally the only way to feel like you can make a point is to kill the fucks that have been holding you down and telling you that you are getting better.
Trust me this disease isn't fun and and the funny thing is the docs  tell me that this music is too negative. Like ""Fade To Black"".. I say bullshit. I feel good knowing that there is someone else that feels alot like I do and has the balls and talent to sing about it. Want more BP lyricss? Read ""Until It Sleeps"" and alot of others and as mentioned ""Unnamed Feeling"". Everyone feels like this jsut some of us have a harder time controling it.

Now the funny side of this song is I used to listen to it on my way to work at the factory and it fuckin' fits perfectly there for me too!
By the way..""Master Of Puppets"" is THE best thrash metal LP EVER. Bar none. From  ""Battery"" to the last kickyour ass tune ""Damage, Inc"" it just doesn't get ANY better!

Uh dude, what the hell are you talking about? A man drowns himself, a man slits his throat, someone cuts his nuts off and bleeds to death, they smoke pot, visit prostitues, and someone gets a lobotomy, causing him to have a fate worse than death. Then, the Indian kills him because he knows he wouldn't want to live that way. The Metallica song doesn't do the book justice, and if you haven't read it, go pick it up immedietally, it's a great read.

It is about someone who is in a sanitarium. A sanitarium is a mental institution which can be left on a inmate's own will. 

""No locked doors - No windows barred"" 
""No things to make my brain seem scared"" 


On the other hand the 'sanitarium' could also be a simile for the society.

I feel it calls our entire existence the sanitarium. How the general population is controlled and exploited by the government. How those who rebel are made to seem crazy.

People do not use logic and reason but preconceptions and peer pressure to determine such a thing and it helps them keep us in a bubble.

But the song refuses to give in, with frustration trying to rally the people to wake up and take charge.

I found this at countrymusic.about.com, from Miranda herself:

""That's about [fellow 'Nashville Star' contestant] Travis Howard. Travis wrote a ""dating"" song about me. It was called ""Train Wreck."" It says, ""You're just a train wreck and I'm a penny on the tracks."" He sent it to me from L.A. That was like a shock to my heart. I thought, ""OK. All right."" I was so angry about him writing a song like that about me. I thought, ""You know what? He's the one who left home and forgot about everyone. What about that?"" My mom and I were on the way to Houston. On the way, I got out my guitar and wrote ""What About Georgia"" in, like, an hour. That's my favorite of all my songs.""

On her website she has an 'Ask Ran' section and I remember once someone asked her that same question about the bullet and the gun and she said it means do you still do everything your dad tells you to do like how a bullet goes wherever the gun points it. Hope that helps!

I finally understand what the line, ""it's a Jimmie Rodgers song that what was long forgotten,"" means. Jimmy Rodgers was one of the first real country stars, whose career and life was cut short from tuberculosis. He was way back in the 20s and 30s and the fact that was so long ago along with his tragically short career makes it rather poignant that Bryan mentions him in this song, because Jimmie Rodgers at one time WAS country.

Great song overall

Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes"" 

Oh and Bruno Mars' voice is perfect.

This is a beautiful song. I love it a lot. He is the ONLY, and yes, ONLY rapper I will listen to. Because,

(a) His songs have meaning. They're not about sex and cars and bling blingin' rims.
(b) He has talent. He can actually rap. I don't think d12 is any good. =/

Anyway. I love this song and I'm getting his new CD right now... hehe.

Eminem has said publicly that he feels incredibly guilty that he hasn't been there for several important events in Hailie's life. He almost missed her first day of school because he was in rehab recently.

I believe he's saying that he is effectively ""killing"" Slim Shady because while Slim Shady made him famous and rich, now he wants that part of him to die so he can go back to being Marshall Mathers, father.

Awesome song and lyrics.

What I get out of the song is that he's killing only Slim Shady, the part of him that started all of the controversies and created all the problems.

@selenagomezz 















This song tugs at my heart strings and gives me mega goosebumps. I can relate to it so much in every single line. Like Justin, my father is also no longer around... and there are so many times I wish he was. Ive always wanted to be able to write a song to sum up how I feel deep down, but Justin has done it effortlessly and simply. I cannot get over how talented this lil guy is.

not having a father does things to you deep down, it changes you.. makes you strive to be strong for your mother, dear to your families, it makes you protective, sometimes moody and emotional in private. It gives us a need to be the best we can be at everything in life, to kinda prove we can take care of ourselves without having our father around, even tho at the back of our minds there is always that something missing.
I see this in justin too, he strives to protect his mum, to be the best he can be, never give up. His cocky confident persona is a blanket over the wounds that lie underneath. In a way, perhaps Justin even has his father to thank for making him the determined person he is today! even still, I wish I could meet this lil dude and give him a huge hug. I think this is the underlying reason for everything he has achieved, and definately a big part of what makes him tick.

He lusted after her from the first moment. She was pure, free and full of vitality. Her virginial state was as much of an allure as her beauty. But from the moment they lay together, that part of her was gone.
On the second day, he's already realised that the previous day, when they were together, is never going to be surpassed. Anything alse will seem cheap next to that. She'll get older, her innocence is fading, they will argue etc. So he invites her down to the river.
Then, to preserve her integrity and his memories, he slays her on the third day.
That's why all beauty must die - if you've achieved perfection, what is left to live for?

@justanotherkydd 















Vocal performances are great, and the last few stanzas are lovely and disconcerting. Which is the great thing about Nick Cave - he begins the song having the listener think it's a mushy ballad with lyrics straight from a romance novel (""From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one,"" ""My trembling subsided in his sure embrace"") and it ends with him killing her. Genius!

If I had to be critical, I would say that the chorus could have been changed. I understand he's going for a ""Gaelic tale"" effect here, but it sounds so awkward and redundant.

I love that ""wind light as a thief"" line. That is such an unexpected simile, I think.

I get a ominous feel about this song. The music and the way it's performed is just so beautiful but the lyrics are absolutely terrifying. Is there anyone who knows if there's a tale, myth or true story behind the lyrics. Also I think the ""the wind light as a thief "" is a reference to him beeing about to steel her life. I really like that the ending is kind of given away already in the second line: ""... was Elisa Day""

@lathyrus 















i'm not sure about necrophelia, it never actually mentions what happens after the murder. to me this song's about a man (a deeply disturbed one at that), who feels a desire to destroy something beautiful. he find's the most beautiful girl he can (""more beautiful than any woman I'd seen""), woo's her and akes her amid the wild roses to which he keeps comparing her where he kills her.

alternately this song could be about a man who murders his girlfriend in order to preserve her beauty. however the line ""From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one"" along with ""On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow"" makes it sound as though he'd planned the whole thing from before he ever met her.

whatever it's about it's a brilliant song, it's so macabre and yet, so beautiful i love everything about this song

@Bathory 















Thats a really interesting insight, xpixiex, I hadn't considered the possibility of 'The Wild Rose' being used by newspapers etc as a name for the murder victim. Anyway, I think the firstverse sheds light on the notion of the murderer killing in order to preserve beauty:

From the first day I saw her I knew she was the one

[As early as the first ambigous line of the verse, Nick Cave introduces the motive of killing in order to preserve the image of beauty for eternity. In particular, he subverts the notion of 'the one' i.e. the one person with whom you spend the rest of your life with, by tying it in with the killers' predeliction for murdering beautiful women and selection of a victim.]

She stared in my eyes and smiled 
For her lips were the colour of the roses 
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild 

[The comparison of her lips to bloody roses growing by the river bank is a premonition of what is to follow with the victim's murder.]

Also, in the third verse, the rose metaphor is tied into the notion of a flower representing female chastity:

On the second day he came with a single red rose 
Said: ""Will you give me your loss and your sorrow"" 
I nodded my head, as I lay on the bed 
He said, ""If I show you the roses, will you follow?""

I also like how it seems like a run-of-the-mill love ballad, but every now and then, something makes you feel as if something's not quite right. Until the end comes and you find out why.

I've always thought this song could be about Satan.  He's not omnipresent, he can only be in one place at a time.  Also, he ""craves the dust of the Earth"" or something to that effect.  He's always on the move, cause he's got a lot of people to get in what I'm sure to him is very little time.
Even ""my body lies but still I roam"" could be interpreted that hell's angels are out working all the time where he isn't.
Anyways, that's just my thoughts.

I think this song is about a couple, and they break up because she has to move far away. Time passes(?), and the guy is still in love with her. They don't really stay in contact, mainly because the guy is too scared to find out if she still has feelings for him. They may have mentioned that they could get back together later in life, but he denies it because ""nothing lasts forever""
so yeah its about a guy still in love with a girl

@chaitalisingh 















To me, this song is about ending a relationship due to the distance. 5 Seconds of Summer wrote this song by themselves so it's most likely about one of their relationships when they left for tour in the first place. 

For a while we pretended 
That we never had to end it
But we knew we'd have to say goodbye 

They both knew that the boy had to leave for tour sooner or later so he could fulfill his dream. They tried not to think about this but in the back of their mind they always knew it was going to happen and that they had to end their relationship.

You were crying at the airport
When they finally closed the plane door
I could barely hold it all inside

Obviously, both of them are effected equally by the break up and it's heartbreaking for them. 

Torn in two 
And I know I shouldn't tell you
But I just can't stop thinking of you
Wherever you are
You
Wherever you are
Every night I almost call you
Just to say it always will be you
Wherever you ar

The boy is torn in two because on the one hand, it's his chance to finally live his dream and do what he always dreamt of, but on the other hand he has to leave his girlfriend behind and breaks not just her heart, but his own. 
He now is away seeing the world and fulfilling his dream, but nevertheless he cannot stop thinking about his former girlfriend. He misses her and still loves her because for him, there will be no other girl than her, she will always be the one. 

I could fly a thousand oceans
But there's nothing that compares to
What we had and so I walk alone

No matter where he is in this world, he compares every girl he meets to his ex-girlfriend, but no one is as good as she was. She still is the best thing that has ever happened to him and he thinks he will never feel the way he did with her again. This is the reason why he doesn't have a new girlfriend yet but is still single. 

I wish I didn't have to be gone
Maybe you've already moved on
But the truth is I don't want to know 

He still wishes that he didn't have to leave so he could be with her as he is still thinking about her. He isn't sure whether she still feels the same way for him or whether she moved one, but he doesn't even want to know because if she moved on, his heart would break even further knowing that she is happy without him while he still suffers from the break up. 

You can say we'll be together someday
But nothing lasts forever
Nothing stays the same
So why can't I stop feeling this way? 

I'm not entirely sure about this part, but in the essentials he wonders why he still loves his ex-girlfriend when they say that nothing lasts forever. But if nothing lasts forever, why does his love for her still lasts to this day? 

So this song kinda tells the story of a young couple breaking up because he has to leave. While he is happy to leave because he get's to do everything he ever dreamt of he is heartbroken because he had to break up with his girlfriend and leave her behind. He never stops thinking about her or loving her, no matter where they are in this world, and he doesn't want another girlfriend because she will always be the one for him.

I think the song is about one of them in a serious relationship, but they have to end it because they are touring all the time, so they can't spend time with that one person and don't want them to just wait for them all the time.

But the guy can't get over her because he loves her too much, but he knows it won't work.

I love this song and band so much, they make me a proud aussie <3

I think its about when they had a long distance relationship and they knew it had to end but they didn't want it to and when it comes to like them knowing the girl has moved on he is still in love with her.
But the video for this song is for the fans with loads of videos of them while being on tour and stuff

This song to me is about a couple who have loved each other since they were kids..... they've always had insane feelings for each other but of course life gets in the way and circumstance fucks things up for them... and they have to break up but the feelings won't go away, and they still want each other.

"
1269,While My Guitar Gently Weeps.json,"
I hadn't actually paid any attention to this song until santana's cover with yo-yo ma and india arie. It is beautiful, you all should check it out.

Ok firstly, I do not agree with any of the comments above. I do not think George meant for this to be a love song, at all. This is an elegy, a lament, for the decadence of the world and society in general. George was the one Beatle that brought the spirituality (not RELIGION, but spirituality) to the group, being a Hare Krishna devotee (and bhakti- bhakti meaning devotion- yogi) for a great part of his life. The Hare Krishna movement as well as some other Hindu elements were a big influence for George's writing.

This is the song how I interpret it, and interpreting it from a spiritual point of view:


""I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping 
While my guitar gently weeps 
I look at the floor and I see it need sweeping 
Still my guitar gently weeps ""

the first line is my favorite line. he senses a lot of potential in people, a lot of hope, a lot of capacity to love in every human on Earth; but nevertheless it is sleeping, it isn't yet awakened. It is there, we all have it, but it is not yet awoken. We can all be extraordinary, great human beings, he still haven't reached or full potential yet because it is sleeping within us. These same lines are repeated at the end of the song, i don't think it is a coincidence. He is reminding ourselves of all the potential we have. I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping, he is encouraging us to observe where is it that we are standing on; if where we are at in our lives is beneficial for us, if we need to get rid of bad habits in order to live a prosperous life.

""I don't know why nobody told you 
how to unfold you love 
I don't know how someone controlled you 
they bought and sold you""

Yet again, he senses the potential, the capacity of us human beings to love and do great things, but we just don't know yet how to reach our full potential to do good. It is there alright, but folded; unused, untouched. We have forgotten how to love because of all of the distractions and banalities society has put upon us; we have lost touch with our soul, our soul and spirit is controlled by everyone but us; we are all machines, incapable of loving. 

""I look at the world and I notice it's turning 
While my guitar gently weeps 
With every mistake we must surely be learning 
Still my guitar gently weeps ""

He sees the world and everyone being indifferent and untroubled by all the chaos going on. The world keeps spinning, and yet he just sits back and lets all his agony and helplessness flow through the notes of his guitar. Yet, he still has hope that we all can learn from our mistakes before it is too late to save ourselves, to save our soul and spirit.

""I don't know how you were diverted 
you were perverted too 
I don't know how you were inverted 
no one alerted you""

He can't understand why people don't see hoe distracted they are from their true nature, from their inner selves. He are all corrupted and perverted, and yet we think that there is nothing wrong with us, that we are all 'normal', when the truth is that we are living in a lie.

I hope that after reading it you can see it from my point of view, which I hope is somewhat accurate on what George truly meant by writing it. I am sorry if it is a bit unclear, English is not my first language. I understand what every word in the song means, but when I try to traduce what I think to English it kinda gets lost in translation ^_^

We have been lied to since birth, and every day is a struggle to maintain an awakened state if you live within the system.

@karipr88 By far the best interpretation posted on here. George Harrison was a seeker of truth. He was curious about the world we live in and the meaning behind our existence.

song4julia is right, on The White Album Eric Clapton became the first non-beatle to play on a beatle track (other than orchestra stuff) Towards the end the ""fifth Beatle"" Billy Preston played on a lot of their songs, but Eric was the first.

Now, basically everyone's problem is that they are not treating this song like a poem, which means that its interpretation is being altered. One must understand that the bealtes were as much poets as shakespeare was, and so their songs must be treated like poems. According to this new rule, one thing people must be aware of is that the poet is not necessarily the one speaking in the poem, this is the persona. Knowing this, it is wrong to assume that George is the one singing this song. Another reason why george is not singing this song is due to the intentional fallacy. Anyways, since george is not singing the song, it can only be assumed that instead a mythical dragon is singing as this is the persona of the poem. Now, it must be understood that dragons are a very power race with incredible powers. And of course, with great powers comes great responsibily, and the dragons were not responsible enough to handle their powers and so great wars were fought. Eventually some wise and noble dragons realized they were destroying the earth, and so conspired a plan to despose of the terrible dragons and retreat into space were they would not become violent and harm the beautiful earth god. As they left, they surrended the earth to man, who they assumed would be able to take better care of the earth. Over time of course, man has become violent and has slowly to become more powerful with nuclear weapons and such, and so, the dragon, there is only one know and he is old and has a long white beard like a wizard, because of course he is a wizard like gandalf, anyways, this dragon is looking down on man, who the dragons gave the earth to, and is worried becuase man is becoming to powerful and may not be able to handle that responsibility. While my guitar gently weeps is basically the wise wizard dragons means of telling us to be careful with our power and not to be greedy or violent. If you look at specific lyrics you can see this, ""from all our mistakes we must surely be learning,"" he wants humans to learn and not be like the dragons, he uses the pronoun we like the way a young kindergarten teacher would use the pronoun we to connect her to her class, as in ""we shall go outside today."" other lines equally reflect the dragons tone, worried brows and dissappointed stares, if people want more evidence, i would be glad to explain every line by the dragons emotions, just let me know.

I don't really know the history behind this song, but if I were to guess, I think this song is about George getting overshadowed by John and Paul.  

""I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping, while my guitar gently weeps""

I think that George is saying that there is no love for him from Beatles fans because he never really got a chance to get people to like and appreciate him as much as Beatles fans do John and Paul.  Every time he says while my guitar gently weeps, he is describing himself.  George was really just, ""that Beatle that played guitar and didn't write a lot of songs.""  George is gently weeping because he is forced to help and support people that overshadow him.

""I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping, still my guitar gently weeps,""

This means that George is describing himself almost like a servant for John and Paul because he is helping them make success even though there is none of his creative input, and still he feels sad for helping them.

""I don't know why nobody told you, how to unfold your love,

""I don't know how someone controlled you, they bought and sold you,""

I know this sounds a little weird, but again, this is what I got out of it.  George is the guitar, so he and the guitar are like one person.  He's reassuring himself by talking to the guitar, he's trying to keep it from weeping.  It's like he's talking to himself in a mirror.  George is sad and confused about how John and Paul didn't let him have more creative input, but still controlled him into helping them.  They also, ""bought and sold him,"" by letting him join the band, but basically selling him by excluding him from their songwriting.

""I look at the world and I notice it's turning, while my guitar gently weeps,""

George sees that John and Paul making progress and being successful, but he is still sad because he is not in on their songwriting.

""With every mistake we must surely be learning, still my guitar gently weeps,""

I feel like here George is trying to be optimistic, but realizes quitting is his only option, and if he does, he will be:

A)  Not be successful because of his original lack of popularity from the Beatles

B)  Feeling bad because he feels like he's betraying the people that got him where he is and then Beatles fans will hate him rather than paying no attention to him at all, which almost completely lowers the chances of him being successful as a solo artist.

""I don't know how you were diverted, you were perverted too,""

""I don't know how you were inverted, no one alerted you,""

It's pretty much the same as what he was talking about in the other part where he is sad and confused.  Again, George is, ""talking to the guitar,"" by saying that he is sad and confused about how he had such high hopes about himself the Beatles, but he was just tricked into thinking he would be noticed, and instead he was, ""abused,"" by John and Paul.  He also doesn't know how he was, ""put aside,"" by John and Paul.

I hope you enjoyed my analysis!  Please feel free share yours with me if you feel like I was way off!

@JDF2376 I get what you mean. I visualise that too! Lol			

Just as a point of interest, these are the original lyrics as my grandmother used to sing them....

As I was going over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting. 
I first produced my pistol, and then produced my rapier.
Said stand and deliver, for I am a bold deceiver,

musha ring dumma do damma da 
whack for the daddy 'ol
whack for the daddy 'ol
there's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money, and it made a pretty penny.
I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny.
She said and she swore, that she never would deceive me,
but the devil take the women, for they never can be easy

I went into my chamber, all for to take a slumber,
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder.
But Jenny took my charges and she filled them up with water,
Then sent for captain Farrel to be ready for the slaughter.

musha ring dumma do damma da 
whack for the daddy 'ol
whack for the daddy 'ol
there's whiskey in the jar


It was early in the morning, as I rose up for travel,
The guards were all around me and likewise captain Farrel.
I first produced my pistol, for she stole away my rapier,
But I couldn't shoot the water so a prisoner I was taken.

If anyone can aid me, it's my brother in the army,
If I can find his station down in Cork or in Killarney.
And if he'll come and save me, we'll go roving near Kilkenny,
And I swear he'll treat me better than me darling sportling Jenny

Now some men take delight in the drinking and the roving,
But others take delight in the gambling and the smoking.
But I take delight in the juice of the barley,
And courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

musha ring dumma do damma da 
whack for the daddy 'ol
whack for the daddy 'ol
there's whiskey in the jar

I think he's realizing something here.

He's against the government thinking for everyone and the big companies doing the same thing but then as soon as he goes out there and moves these people, he's the big company.  He's the one thinking for everyone.

So the problem, is the American people who have to follow someone and can't lead themselves but also the government/big companies for taking advantage of that.

I don't know, I think this song talks about someone who's being looked up to... they hears talks about people who are jealous and all that.

The said person then realizes its 'who they are' like the song and they know that they aren't welcome or liked but its not their problem since its their own unique personality.

@angelika 















Obviously this is from the Catching Fire soundtrack, so I'll use that. To be honest, I don't think this has to do with peacekeepers or anyone in authority (but who knows, maybe it does). To me, it's talking about the victors of the Hunger Games. Particularly the popular ones, like Katniss, Peeta, and Finnick. I think it's talking about them and the images they have become, whether a sign of rebellion like Katniss, or the Capitol's Darling, like Finnick. President Snow has shaped the victor's images based on what he wants them to be.

""We were never welcome here, 
we were never welcome here at all.""

To me, this is when the victor returns to their district. There is no room for victors in the districts. They are hated by the people. Victors were never welcome in the districts. Especially when President Snow makes them look like something they aren't and the victor is forced to play along.

""Save us,
what we are
don't look clear
It's all uphill from here.""

This to me is the victor reaching out to someone to help them. They want to be saved from this image Snow has created for them but they can't. It looks easy once they win the Games, but it is really all uphill once the Games are over.

""It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.""

They've been this person for so long now that they are believing it themselves now. They have become the victor Snow wants them to be.

""They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy...""

At this part of the song, it sounds like a realization to me. Just like a breaking point. Maybe not necessarily crazy, but they are just tired of all these labels forced on them and they are done with it. When they sing ""It's who we are"" next, that's them breaking away from all of the labels and going back to who they really are. But the last ""It's all uphill from here"" shows that they know it isn't going to be easy. Incredible song!

@Ohhellothere 















Majority of their songs are about Jesus, the King. This song is about having similar powers to Jesus and people actually have the holy spirit living in them. Medically this is described as a mental disorder like PTSD. But it's just the spirit of God that lives in us. Eminem explains it too in his song, Till I Collapse. Anyway, I am one too and seen the power/force. It's who we are, they say we are aliens, crazy, insane....but whatever, they are jealous and that's their book of jealousy. Listen to Believer after you read this.

I know this song is for Catching Fire but I'm not going to try and compare it to that even though I LOVED the movie. I think this song is about how people judge you. Like 'labeling' people. That means that sometimes people will judge for things THEY see you do. They may not know whether your life is ok or not, but they still judge you from what they see you do.  That's who you are to THEM. 
If you want to tie it into Catching Fire I guess you could say that so much is expected out of Katniss and different people in the story judge her for different things. She also doesn't want to be in the situation she's in, but people still judge her for her actions while she's in this situation. 
I don't know if that makes sense it's really hard to explain, but I hope it helped :)

I absoulutely love this song, I interpret it as you know like children or young adults that are looked down upon in society and are making a stand that they really dont care because they are themselves and that is what makes them happy.

This song is about people who've been supressed and feel jealous of the ones who have it all easy. The song then preaches about how they feel undesired in the world and eventually become rebellious and fight for just something more and are called crazy for that.

Alternatively, the song may refer to someone who leads a rebellion, who believes the enemy views them as jealous.

@Kryossat 















A lot of people have been talking about how this is from the Catching Fire soundtrack but I think that just because it is doesn't mean that it doesn't hold other meaning. Personally, I think this is a song about oppression of certain groups (probably about slavery and the groups that were affected by that but it could also be about other groups like that).

First of all, the title automatically suggests a group that can't change themselves and doesn't want to, and applying that to a racial standpoint, most POC are proud of themselves and would like to be themselves without persecution.

Then, the lines:

Up on the mountain,
Down in the king's lair,
Pushing these boxes in the heat of the afternoon.
Oh, afternoon.

suggest that this group is being forced to do something they don't want to do. And while LGBTQ+ groups certainly are, slavery is literally only being forced to do something that you don't want to do.

Also, the lines:

Save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.
Ooh.

suggest that no matter what happens to this group, good or bad, it is still going to be a struggle for them. And this definitely applies to any group that's ever been persecuted, but any racial group is still experiencing racism to this day.

There are definitely lines that I can't relate to this, but then again, I suck at picking up metaphorical meanings and can't experience this firsthand (I'm white).

Back in october my brother and his friend got into a really bad car accident and his friend died. his friend was like my big bro and it hurts me to think hes gone. the driver(my actual bro) is getting prison time for it and it is not fair. I\'ve lost 2 brothers in the past 8 months and it sucks bad. so this song to me means that they lost someone close to them and dont know how to coupe with the fact they are gone. Also that they wonder what the person would be doing with their life if they were alive today.

Anyway, when I hear this song, I think of all that he could have accomplished, who he could have loved. That's what this song means to me.

Okay - yes, some of the things he says are a little ""risque,"" and he's over played, but anyone who appreciates music can tell you that Eminem is far and away one of the best MC's in rap at the moment.  He has an amazing ability to rhyme and he changes speeds with his rhymes like a true professional.  For the most part, his songs have a personal touch to them (IE, they're about his life, which, I might add, was not an easy one) which helps the listener to connect with what he's saying.  I hate rap (for the most part), but Eminem is kind of a diamond in the rough.  And for whoever said that Eminem is just living off Dre's beats, if you read the liner notes of the new album, you would know that only 3 of the 20 songs were produced by Dre and ""Without Me"" was not one of them.  So, if you're coming here to nay-say...I first suggest you learn to appreciate music as an art form, and also, obtain a sense of class somewhere and not go around posting heinous things about artists you don't like.  You can't hate him that much or else you wouldn't have even come here.

Okay, I apparently understand a very different meaning for this song than everyone else, so I'm going to point it out:

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
-""Where I lived there was a man who sold drugs and he told us about it, so we tried them until we were really high.""

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
-""We are all really high.""

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
-""So, because we liked it we told our friends and they joined us and now we are all happy and addicted.""

As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine
-""And we are high, and everyone else is high too on the drug.""

@brais11392 















OK kids. This is a song simply about living on a tour bus. We in the biz refer to long bus rides as a ""submarine ride."" The first tour busses were the old school busses. The phrase ""many more of them live next door.""is a referal to the crew bus. Taken in this pretext it's simply a song about life on the road. Most songs like this are taken from real life situations and are written from the perspective of everyday occurances. Most musicians live in the moment and are not as introspective as one would assume. Look for the simplistic and you will find most of the meanings to songs are just that, simple.

@Ruralfreed 















A lot of people are saying this song doesn't have a meaning... Well I think it does, actually. Its just you need some background information to understand it. But hey, I might be wrong. 

I heard somewhere that the military used to use yellow submarines for target practice, they painted it yellow because it was easier to see against the blue or green water. So the yellow submarines were just target practice that ended up getting hit and ruined all the time. 

If they DID base the song off that bit of information, then the song makes a lot more sense, to me... Its kinda a sad song, if its true... But it doesn't sound sad, so maybe the yellow submarine thing is just a coincidence.

The Beatles created music which sounded so simple and effortless however people are ignorant to the ingeniousness of there music and lyrics.
And this song is not about pot okay! Just a darn song about nothing really. Fum to listen to. Fun to sing along to. Nothing more than that!

holy shit. what has become of the people that once favored true artistic brilliance. which by all practical means is applying the simplest of notions and disguising them as absurdities. Look deep into this song, only a fool would aloof from this interpetation ;)

In the town where I was born

Lived a man who sailed the sea/ the chances we take that offer risk and fulfillment, yet the reprecussions are still unknown to that moment

And he told us of his life/ the glits, the glam, all those luxuries you once promised yourself would still be attainable after straying from the ranch

In the land of submarines/ land of the unknown, all you know is the ""submarine"" your in

So we sailed on to the sun/ taking the high road, which ever fancies your utopian primrose path

Until we found the sea of green/ the promised land? the moment where it all makes sense
And we lived beneath the waves/ accepting that reality and enjoying it
In our yellow submarine

...idk what do you guys think

@sensiblyadjacent 















I cant believe almost you all think this is a childish song you ignorant douches. this song has so many meanings, besides the acid trip theory. when the beatles wrote this the social revolution was starting and all their songs had to do with capitalism and freedom. ""sea of green"" means money, ""beneath the waves"" means that they were sheltered from the rest of the world. the yellow submarine is a metaphor for the subarban life style many people were trying to get away from or trying to change.
""As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine""

the first line just says that everyone was content living that sheltered life where ""everyone of us has all we need"" , between the clean clear blue skies and lots of money, we life in our yellow submarines.
Even teh line ""and all our friends are all aboard, many more of them live next door."" is explaining the same ideas of peaople that are just trapped in their lives... no beatles song was just to have fun.. because the only way they had fun was buy writting these fucking masterpeieces

"
1301,Yesterday.json,"
I read most of the 104 comments about ""Yesterday"" and was surprised that nobody else picked up the same meaning of the song that I picked up.
When Paul was about 12 years old, his mother died (at a similar time period that John lost his mother).  His mother and father both worked for a living, and the family was pretty poor.  In one book I read it was said that upon hearing that his mother died, he commented ""What are we going to do without her money?""
When we are young, sometimes we say things what we are thinking instead of saying what is politically correct.  Sure, he loved his mother, but he also was worried about the future as well.  In retrospect, he probably wishes he had never made that comment.  Before she was gone, his life was much better.
""I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday"".  Expand on that thought and that line, and you have the meaning of the song.

Lennon: ""I never went to high school reunions. My thing is, Out of sight, out of mind. That's my attitude toward life. So I don't have any romanticism about any part of my past.

You know I don't believe in yesterday. I am only interested in what I am doing now.""

The story goes that Paul came up with the tune without any lyrics, and in order to keep the tune in his head kept singing ""Scrambled eggs, oh you've got such lovely legs"". But did he actually write out the whole song or just this one line?

Here are the scrambled eggs lyrics. Whether or not these are the original lyrics written by paul or whether someone else made them up later, I do not know. They fit very well.. Almost too well to be confident that Paul actually wrote them before he changed the lyrics and song to Yesterday. It seems almost more likely they were made up afterwards by someone else who had heard the original title.

Scrambled eggs
Have an omelet with some muenster cheese.
Put your dishes in the washbin please
so I can clean the scrambled eggs.

Join me, do
There are lots of eggs for me and you
I've got ham and cheese and bacon too
so go get two and join me, do.

Fried or sunny-side
just aren't right. The mix-bowl begs.
Quick - go get a pan
and we'll scram-ble up some eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs.

Scrambled eggs
Good for breakfast, dinnertime or brunch
Don't buy six or twleve - buy a bunch
and we'll have lunch
on scrambled eggs.

I'll never forget the day I was sitting in the doctor's office and my father said that this song truly made him cry...
he never said why it made him cry..
But just the thought of my father crying...
amazes me..

@Cornflksandcheez 















this song is about finding someone you want to spend your life with, but you feel a little hesitant because it never really happens the way you want it to be.  

i think the middle portion talks about the idea of loss, either through separation or through passing away.  but the feeling of love can last way long after one has lost the other.

Stevie Wonder originally wrote and sang this song in the early 1970s. It's interesting to note that Michael's version leaves out 3 lines of lyrics.
The three lines that were omitted are:

""I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day,
Because that's all that I am living for, you see,
Don't worry what happens to me.""

Either way, it's a fantastic, emotionally charged piece of music.

This is the best song on Kenny's new album.  I think it's about a forbidden love; he absolutely loves this woman but either he can't have her or she can't have him.  He goes up Mulholland drive to kick the dust in the canyon wind just like they did the night they shared together.  For a month (30 days and 30 nights) he's been trying to convince himself not to want her and he has to remind himself how bittersweet the morning after was - the bitter taste is because the night before ended.  But in the long run he knows he's hooked and one more night is what he wants although he knows it will depress him again (because he'll want her more) but at the same time it will leave him wanting another night.  ""When it comes to loving you, oh the damage I could do, it's always your favorite sins that do you in"" means he knows that if he lets himself go with her someone (his wife/family, her husband/family?) is going to get hurt but he can't stop because he can't control himself; she's a ""favorite sin.""

It's a ballad about forbidden love and the struggle one has with dealing with it.

@Geman Love this!			

It is about loving someone who is no good for you...no better than that shot of tequila...the craving it, wanting it, even though you know you will regret it later. This woman has the same kind of power over him that the liquor does...it is intense. Obviously, there is a hint of alcohol addiction, but I think the main point it just neither the liquor nor the girl are good for him, yet he cant pass on either one of them. This is an awesome song!

			Wow! I love your comment! I think you explained this so incredibly well! 						

I think Geman's view is one way of looking at it, and I agree the lyrics could be interpreted that way; that essentially he's obsessed about an unrequited love.

On the other hand, this also seems like it could be about drug addiction.  He's kicking ""dust"" in the canyon wind after went to get ""high, high above the lights of town.""  Then he goes on to talk about it being poison in his blood, thirty days and thirty nights (rehab?) when the addiction almost won out over his attempts to break it.  Ultimately, he says he just wants one more night (high) but knows one is one too many and one more would just kick the addiction into overdrive again.  In the end, he knows if he uses the drug again the damage is done and seemingly acknowledges he will because ""it's always your favorite sins that do you in.""

This song is actually about both unrequited love and drug/alcohol abuse. 
He misses his wife or girlfriend, so he drinks. He quits drinking and tries to move on, most likely through a twelve step program.
The words ""One is one too many, and one more is never enough."" Come from the Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book.

Both in the music video and in the lyrics there is a clear depiction of the use of alcohol, in this case tequila. There is a direct correlation between love and addiction in this song as it depicts the equal levels of damage and desparity. To think there is no intentional commentary being made about addiction is clearly either personal denial or ignorance. ""One is one to many, One more is never enough"" is a recover slogan. This song is a brillian play on words which is what makes it so fabulous.

1311,Young and Beautiful.json,"
As this was written specifically for The Great Gatsby- for me, this song is representative of Daisy Buchanan. The 'Hot Summer nights, Mid July' are representative of Gatsby and Daisy's love affair when she was a maiden. 'The way you'd play with me like a child' symbolises the fickleness of their love affair, Daisy is attracted to light heartedness. The  fact she's wondering 'Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful' can highlight character vulnerability but also show us of the fickle nature of Daisy Buchannan. This song is perfectly captures the character of Daisy. The contextual factors of 'new age' show us the unpredictable nature of the novel, of the age in fact. 
The religious conisations of 'Dear Lord, when I get to heaven please let me bring my man' are simply ironic and effective. Gatsby is indeed, a novel without God therefore the fickle treatment of higher power shows the pursuit of aesthetics as oppose to morality. 


Mini essay on how Lana Del Rey's Young and Beautiful symbolises a lot of the book haha!

			Agreed, besides, in the scene where Daisy talks with Nick in the garden alone, in their first meeting, she says 'I've seen the world, done it all...' After that, I immediately connected the character with Lana's song.			






			Agreed, besides, in the scene where Daisy talks with Nick in the garden alone, in their first meeting, she says 'I've seen the world, done it all...' After that, I immediately connected the character with Lana's song.			

I know this song is from the Great Gatbsy movie and I haven't seen it yet. But I feel like adding my interpretation from personal experience. 

To me it's a beautiful and soft cry. It reminds me of longing for someone in the initial stages of a relationship, and sensing something from them, almost knowing something about them that prohibits you from believing in their love. Yet, you give in all the same without knowing. Almost convincing yourself ""I know you will (be true)"". The phrase ""young and beautiful"" is just an excuse, a fitting one, in the circumstances that shapes your limits with them as well as your hope in them. It helps you enjoy and live the moment (away from a truth you sense from them). That sentence ""until I've got nothing but my aching soul"" sums up how much hope she's investing just to love him. A cry of hope, almost to the Universe, to carry them through. She's trying to be positive for both of them because his attention brings her so much joy as if it's as genuine as it could get. It could be enough for both of them to escape into it forever. But that's the problem, they're escaping in every senese.. which is why she can't help asking till the end of the song ""will you still love me?..."" but there's no bitterness between them, as so much has been opened up and understood between that there is no room for bitterness. They understand each other. That's the blessing and problem. In her voice... you can almost here a positive hoping that the soul transcends and all will be right but at the same time that is what's sickening and draws them to the grave, each other... that sadness, lesson, betrayal. Those are the things that will make sure they will be. No other way is there a positive glimpse into the unanswerable.

			I have seen the film & basically put Gatsby in Lana's shoes and you have it right. 			

This song is very self explained, but she's just asking her man if he will still love here when she's no longer young and beautiful, or when she all she has is her soul. But she knows he will. Then she's asking God if when she gets to heaven, that can she bring him with her, cause she cant bare to be without him.

My favorite part is ""Oh that grace, oh that body, oh that face, makes me wanna party."" I love that part!

@piecexo 















This song is so underrated it is RIDICULOUS!   It captures the very essence of The Great Gatsby brilliantly. It is from the perspective of Daisy Buchanan, the character and the symbol.  Daisy is the reason for Gatsby's everything.  She's a pretentious snob; beautiful, unattainable.  What does she mean?  She IS money, wealth, success.  Poor boys can't date rich girls, so Gatsby becomes s billionaire to have her finally, but even that isn't enough.  IT IS NEVER ENOUGH!  All those shirts, the parties, the money; he will never be good enough.  Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?  It's rhetorical...it's a siren song...he'll never know her when she's no longer young and beautiful because he'll die before he gets that chance.  Daisy only has power because he gives it to her...he makes her shine like diamonds and not the other way around...dear Lord when I get to Heaven...that is the promise of salvation she is suppose to give but of course does not...because in the end, money can't buy you those things.  Your soul is your responsibility and you can't find it in someone or something else.  Daisy is the American Dream, a facade to distract us from the real work.  She is what you think you want, young and beautiful, until she is not.  She gets old and no longer desirable...pulling the proverbial curtain up and seeing the wizard is no wizard, just a flawed and pathetic man with power only because you give it to him; like God.

@Vvvy1978 ...wow, that is a really insightful comment...thanks for posting.			

I think most people forget certain parts of the song. Besides it being a self contained song, ""Will [he] still love [her] when [she's] no longer young and beautiful"" it has the part about the aching soul.  Love is love.  Attraction is attraction.  Two separate entities all together.  I look at me and my girlfriend.  60 years from now, will she be ""attractive"" having aged and all? Probably won't be the definition, or even remotely close, of attractive, but I will still love her. This is where the aching soul part comes in.  You have the physical attributes that make you want someone. Then you find their person, their soul to complete the rest. You fall in love.  But we all have issues, mistakes, regrets, etc.. When the beauty fades, all you still have left with you are said issues, mistakes, regrets, etc.. We all have to be realistic in the overall mating ritual that is man, we see first, then we approach and then we get to know them.  That's just he way it is. So that said, without the first thing that made them approach you, that drove them to you, all gone, and you are left with just mistakes, memories, regrets, maybe some hurting that you did to them, or hurting that they did to you, will there still be love?  Narrator, LDR, understands it so too.""All that grace, all that body All that face, makes me wanna party""  I do find it fascinating though that she want him to be that way into death. Maybe without those good looks, the shell that remains no longer make her want to party?

I like to think of this as in Daisy's perspective. We all know that good things must to an end. Daisy is stunning, young, beautiful, and rich. But I think in end, she wants someone who will love her no matter what and deep in her heart, she knows only Gatsby can grant her these things. 
She'll loose all her wealth in the end and all that will be left is her ""aching soul"".

This song represents the reflections of Daisy Buchanan on her past, her present and future with Gatsby in a very obvious way.

However, taken out of context, we could find other meanings to this song.

""I’ve seen the world
Done it all, had my cake now.""
The girl is growing up, she is getting older, gathering more experiences... She is not innocent anymore. 
""The crazy days, the city lights
The way you’d play with me like a child""
He had always handled her that way, as an innocent girl. It seems then legitimate for her to wonder : ""Will you still love me when I’m no longer young and beautiful""
""Dear lord when I get to heaven
Please let me bring my man
When he comes tell me that you’ll let him
Father tell me if you can""
She's fairly certain she will go to heaven, but she begs God to let him go with her. 'Young and Beautiful' or, she was just too young to begin with.

Lana Del Rey's song always have that 'daddy' feeling.

daisy did wrong certainly but gatsby did lied to her about his profession... and she lied about her only love... what if that accident wud have not happenned and daisy wud have known about tom's affair... gatsby wud have taken daisy in the end..
However moral of the story is no matter how rich or famous u have become... in the end u will take nothing and will be alone... gatsby betrayed his parents assuming himself god's child then why he put that much faith and hope in a strange girl... god's child is always alone... forever wed was a blame game... gatsby wasnt really great... he does everything for his love abandoning those who loved him even before he was born... this is KARMA

@feelingextremeties she did know about the affair she just didn't know with who it was. she was very aware that Tom wasn't ever faithful to her I think that is why she gave in so easily in wanting to leave him or better yet start an affair with Gatsby, sort of like revenge.

not necessarily ""young"" girls, IMO, but girls who are just with him for what he can give them. and even though they have no emotional investment in him, he finds himself always falling for them and coming back to them.

I first heard this JUST as I was starting to get over my ex (a young girl both literally and in this song's meaning) and it just killed me. I wasn't a fan of this guy before, but now I am really very impressed by him. not only a great pop songwriter, but amazingly skilled vocalist as well.

I see it as a guy who is lonely and attaches himself to girls who provide with him unhealthy and - eventually - destructive relationships. and I can only say ""been there, done that, still going to therapy over it"". the song really moved me and also opened my eyes to my own behaviour with girls.

lovely piece of music =)

He spends lost of money on these cute, young girls. He always ends up with a young girl, but he doesn't know why. He knows his relationships with them aren't good or going anywere, but he loves them too much to stop. In the end, he just ends up wasting money and time on them on them and making himself more miserable. Though he dreams of actually getting married and settling down with one of them, he knows that true, sacrificail love isn't found in these kind of relationships.

I like this song because I'm always attracked to girls at least 3 years younger than me. But this song just keeps reminding me that if I get in a relationship with a young girl, I'll only end up hurting her and myself. Because, even if I truly love her, she's too young and isn't ready for the type of serious relationship that I want.

To each his/her own. It's about preference. It's about choice. And some need the high of physical beauty and youth. More power to 'em, if that's what floats their boats. We each have our preferences. I won't date men who aren't very bright, but not due to my ego; rather, I simply get bored if I am not constantly learning. I tend to like younger men because sitting around watching TV or talking about chidlren all the time is not my idea of letting lose whenever I'm not working. However, if an older guy came along (as one did last summer) who acted youthful and was what I consider wild in ways that are important to me, so be it. Again, it's about preference. Nothing wrong with being attracted to gorgeous, young females who provide an emotional high and an ego boost that obviously older females cannot. Good song. Like most of Mars' music.

			That's not what it says. How did you ever get that meaning. It's straightforward and nothing about a wrong direction and worry. Sounds as though it's more of a tongue-in-cheek tone...oh, they make a mess of me, but I will always want theml Woe is me...with a big smile on my face. Interesting song, but your interpretation comes out of left field, I believe.

Interesting song, but your interpretation comes out of left field, I believe. 			

To fully comprehend the lyrics in this song, you have to understand or have experience dealing with serious addiction.  In this particular instance, Bruno has an ""addiction"" to young, pretty girls.  However, the keyword here is GIRLS (as in more than one).  He knows what's right:  one man, one woman--holy matrimony.  However, he can't seem to fight off his strong inclination to promiscuity.

Bruno isn't boasting.  In fact, the tone of the song is very somber.  His addictive tendencies hurt others around him as well as himself because ultimately, he realizes true love can't be found unless he changes.  It's an introspective look at why he can't seem to find happiness.  Brilliant!

			Also, when he speaks of “young” girls, he could also mean “new” relationships.  The want for something new is also a high some people seek.  Butterflies, weak knees, and rapid heart beats aren't typically associated with established relationships.

Basically, I think of this being about how he continues to get himself involved with girls who he gives and gives to, that only take from him.  He knows that he shouldn't and that it makes him miserable, but he just keeps doing it with girl after girl.

The song is about his struggle to remain grounded while he realizes that he is constantly falling in love with young, wild squirrels.It seems like he also used be in love with birds, and that maybe they join them in the morning. I don't quite understand that part. He might not be describing a romantic love, but he cares about them nonetheless. It seems like he is getting jerked around by the squirrels he's meeting and that it's hard for him to feel at peace. It seems like he's having a great time with them, but he doesn't sound fulfilled. Maybe it's that squirrels aren't very good companions, or maybe it's just that he's still learning how to be himself.

He is talking about how he always goes after the same type of girls; ones who only care for his money and fame, and he can't help himself but keep the same relationship repeating itself with different people.

I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

The second verse I think he is saying how he wants to find a girl, fall in love and get married, like how it usually happens, but because he is famous and rich, he doesn't know if the girl is just with him because of it.

Oh, I still dream of simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist
When you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

The chorus is just saying how he keeps falling for the same type of girls, ones who only want him for fame and fortune and no matter what he does, he will still go for them.

No matter what you do (No matter what you do)
Yeah, you young wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you

Beautiful song, absolutely love it so emotional and raw. This song deserves more recognition in my opinion

Talented artist and fun song, albeit a bit lyrically repetitious. Obvious meaning... t's about a guy (or woman?) who likes young girls.

This song talks about how when people are young all they want to be is older.  Then when the older years come, they look back and realize they grew up to fast and that they wish they were still younger.  It shows that you should take life one day at a time and not take things for granted.

Had no excuses for the things that we'd done 
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly 
Young"" yeah thats us.. right on the dot.. and we all cant wait to be older.. but i know as soon as i am ""older"" were gonna want to be young again.. ahh such a good song

I know you're as young as you feel you are, but when you've reached a certain age you have to show responsibility. I'd love to rebel, but i do have a clue... So it comes down to acting crazy once in a while instead of all the time :-)

Ironically when we are young,we wish we were older,then when we're older-we wish were younger.

""Youngblood"" is another teen summer relationship anthem for 2018. We all can relate to the back and forth that 5 Seconds of Summer goes through in this young relationship. A very self-aware song, they even recognize that this is a problem that mainly plagues young people by putting it right in the title. I can just remember being that aloof teen over summer vacation stringing my crush along and giving them whiplash by going back and forth. In this song, the on-and-off relationship is ended and then started again during every chorus. Talk about indecisive! The song ends with the relationship being off again, and while my present-day self hopes that they're not going to try again on this obvious train wreck of a relationship, my teen self who loves drama just knows that the singer is going to end up going back and forth with his (now ex-) partner again throughout the fall semester.
